It worked!
It did work
nice
Night
Later
Do you know where istanbul is?
uhh, yeah
I do
why? :suspicious:
Because of the world congress, gotta go fuck up Peter man
just to be clear, you realize that's my capital, right?
No
made a code change to prevent duplication in here
may have broken it; we'll see
lol
I think you broke it because it's your turn
I think....?
think I fixed it
hah!
storing the latest webhook payload in a text file
and checking if the current payload matches the last one
if it does, skip
seems multiple people's civ clients are now generating the webhook post requests
:success:
hmmmm in a 2 person game it just reloads
probably reloads if you wait long enough in 4 person too
Nooooooo
lol
I bankrupt myself by accident
Soooo poor.....
What do you need to help fight Pericles? I'm building up right now, but that bankruptcy hurt my mil alot
I need tech
Yea i don't know how he magically got ahead of me
And I can't give you tech :disappointed:
he got ahead by taking other capitals
he's a violent mofo
used my 14 remaining envoys to turn all the city states within peracles border against him
he now has war from within too
he fucking has 31 envoys at jerusalem
wtf
Right, I'm so confused by his sudden rise to power and dominance
he's been fairly dominant all game
it's been a pain in my ass
as he's my only neighbor
oh, I'm at war with peracles as of this turn
so that's nice
he got mad that I had spies in his capital sabotaging shit
I'm building up again, but it'll probably take like 10 turns to rebuild my military :disappointed:
this gives me an excuse to take a capital though
so there's that
hell yeah, we're going to get the emergency declared on perecles
now I get revenge
WTF DON'T I GET TO VOTE?!?!?!
did you click on the side thing?
did you use 30 points to join the emergency?
No it said I don't get to particate. You only use 30 points to bring it to the table, then everyone votes on it
Have you seen the rogue state policy???
no?
what's it do?
+50% prod to nuke projects and nukes, no influence towards Envoys
jesus
that's a hell of a policy
you going to nuke peracles?
nuke his capital
do it
do-it
just-do-it
8 turns before manhattan is complete. I'll probably wait for the free police change at 4 tuns
But yea, I'm building bombers for the explicit purpose of delivering nukes
try not to nuke the northwesternmost 3 cities
The only down side is I don't have good access to his capital, I'll be coming in via the old viking empire
I want those
I'm not there yet, but yea i'll work my way across
FYI there's a luxury trade from me, don't miss it
oops
missed
turns out it was your game
I can't kill it
