:excited:
seeking mountain suggestions
How long would we be planning for? A weekend, or just a day trip?
I am no help on mountain suggestions
Unless we're flying
weekend trip
thinking either thursday to sunday or friday to sunday
This is so odd -  I hadn't heard anyone talking about ski trips since the wf ski trip signup, and now two people asked me about one on the same day. Not that I'm complaining
I'll add more options once I get a few more dates back from my wife
