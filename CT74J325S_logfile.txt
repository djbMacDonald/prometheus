:excited:
seeking mountain suggestions
How long would we be planning for? A weekend, or just a day trip?
I am no help on mountain suggestions
Unless we're flying
weekend trip
thinking either thursday to sunday or friday to sunday
This is so odd -  I hadn't heard anyone talking about ski trips since the wf ski trip signup, and now two people asked me about one on the same day. Not that I'm complaining
I'll add more options once I get a few more dates back from my wife
Brian is almost certainly a +1 for any of my days (assuming he's invited?)
assuming we have room, he's invited
so basically he's invited
unless some freak coincidence happens where we can't find housing big enough to fit our group
in which case we still might just book two separate instances of lodging
:thankssss:
I wouldn't assume Sam is coming for whatever weekend we pick. I'm picking weekends while dancing around our schedule.
she's welcome to come if she's free
I don't know if she's into snow sports
Not really. She goes, but I think she has already enough trips going on she'd prefer the break
