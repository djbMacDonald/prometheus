Kirby Air Ride
Sorry Dave, but this channel is not the Chaos one.
I am free every night next week, and each morning/afternoon of the weekend.
We have a lot of new options to play now. Lords of Waterdeep, Dungeon Petz, Brass, Terraforming Mars expansions, etc.
What if I have particular time preferences like Saturday the 4 mornings?
I guess list them on this thread.
Can't do 4th or 5th
Sat and sun 11 and 12th I can only do before 4
some of this will change once we get a result on Gloomhaven
Indeed. TM would be good for one of the weekends during the day
How do I undo a vote for Monday? Asking for a friend...
Saturday/Sunday might be off depending on Patriots schedule
Click on the little monday button
Saturday 8pm are Pats
For this week, if they win they play next week too
Ohhhh gottcha
I think the poll broke or doesn't work on mobile anymore
Got a chance to play viticulture. I liked it. Interesting worker dynamic where you have to decide how many actions to take in summer or winter. 
Yea I enjoy it the first time I played it
That's good. Haven't gotten to play it like I thought I would this weekend.
Same! Played it over Christmas and it was good
Wednesday or Monday?
Can't see all the results on mobile but can see <@UPGVCMGD9> and <@UDDE5960N> and <@UDBGH9BMX>
Wednesday, Monday is out for me
Wednesday is fine with me
Sweet, Wednesday seems like a good one to shoot for
Also I changed my availability to Wednesday nights instead of Tuesdays
This wed? Sure
to be clear, this means we're no longer doing tuesdays at my place?
I can do this Wed
I have the other Brass now (Birmingham)
Original brass seems like it is a little simpler. We might want to play one game with CJs version first. 
Although starting with Birmingham will not be terrible. Maybe just a bit much for a while. 
I can host on Wednesday
I can do wed as well if that doesn't mess things up
Sent out a calendar invite; there are currently six of us
I think you didn't change the end date.
I sunset that invite
I didn't think you were coming on wednesday
oh, I was conflating two things. Since Drew had been talking about moving Tuesdays to Wednesdays, I just assumed that's the email I was seeing.
you are correct, I won't be making this Wednesday.
all is good.
I'm waiting for confirmation from Drew that I should make Wednesday's recurring
instead, it will be wednesdays
will it be every other wednesday?
This is to get that conversation going. Yes, it would be Wednesdays instead of Tuesdays. If that doesn't work for you or you can't host on an every other week basis, that's good to know!
Yup, please make recurring :)
Is the invite set to the Wednesdays that Doug can make?
so not this wednesday, but next
Ok, I just don't see a recurring event for that yet, just the one off for this Wednesday
I can accomodate wednesdays :thumbsup:
Can we set up a recurring event for every other Wednesday starting a week from this Wednesday?
Also I'll officially have Saturdays off going forward so I'll be free for more weekend hadn't nights or hosting more parties
sure
<#CQW23P86N|gloomhaven>
<#CQW23P86N|gloomhaven>
That means we can go swing dancing!
Did we decide on a game to play tomorrow? Sorry if it was in a thread that I missed
No we settled on a day and place
coo - I'd vote for Dungeon Petz or Lords of Waterdeep if we're going by the list <@UDL020K8D> posted a few days back
Both those are mine. Has anyone played either of them before?
I've heard good things about both and wanted to play both. Also, I have much more of a chance of doing well in a game nobody has played than one that everyone knows well :smile:
I had actually thought of buying both Black Friday 2018, but decided not to in the end
Tho do you have the Lords of Waterdeep expansion? I heard that the game is much better with it
yes
my commitment doesn't start until 6. If you start at 5:20 or 5:30 sharp I could explain the rules then bounce
Ah, there's a very very low chance I could do that so that's fine. Didn't remember you weren't coming, sorry
if you want one of mine, just try to decide tonight so I don't have to bring multiple.

also, <@UETS9HTSS> remind me next gloomhaven to grab my copy of Concordia. I forgot it last time I was at your place.
yep, it's still here
Do we have 5 or 6? I see 5 people voted for the game night, but 6 people in the invite. I ask because I'd love to play <https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182626/mistborn-house-war> with you guys, but it caps at 5
(tho that game gets MUCH better if you've read Mistborn)
Waterdeep plays 6.

so does Viticulture (I know there are copies of that floating around now)
We should have 6, me, <@UDBGH9BMX>, <@UDC4QL95G>, <@UDC03KCGK>, <@UPGVCMGD9>, <@UETS9HTSS>. with Doug skipping this week
I'd try viticulture
Viticulture was good.

Thing to note, if you watch a video on how to play, there are a couple small differences in the essential version from the base version. so just watch the right video.

Rules are simple, I played with no one knowing how, just reading the booklet.
I'd be down for a 2nd round of it
The only weird thing about that game was the max VP. First time I played it, I "got" 28 points, until we realized the max exisited and was 25. The guy with 24 almost won, because he had better tie breaks, even though I thought I was far ahead.
That's very good info
thanks for the heads up
only game I've ever seen that
Viticulture it is then? Do I need to bring my copy?
I know I don't have one; and likely Marissa doesn't want to cart her's from belmont
Also Dave why would timing not work out? Game night starts at 5:30
You are correct not dragging my games over.
Because we don't have a KO emoji to put on Marissa's post
It's not a problem to bring my copy
Oh, is 5:30 a hard 5:30? it used to be like, 5:45
I wouldn't say it's a _hard_ 5:30pm start, but that's been pretty much what we've been doing for the past few months
:rogerroger:
There is public shaming for being late now
I'll try my best to get to work on time tomorrow...
So my office is having their first happy hour tomorrow, so I *might* be a little late. Assume I arrive at 7ish
And I bring homemade bread to account for my shame
Will that work for you guys? If it gets cancelled/doesn't happen I can be on tit
Clearly you're in for game number 2 of the night
You got it
Shoot for 5 player games? When CJ has to tap out, Marissa taps in?
That works for me
:terraform: :mars: ?
With prelude sure
The newer expansions aren't as fun imo
have you tried Turmoil? (I haven't yet, I just know its the newest one)
TM always gets my vote
I have I didn't like
I always like TM
I have all the expansions, so we don't need to bring anything over
CJ can take back dead of winter
Doug can take back concordia
Drew can sell me gaia project
I also just got Alchemists
I now have Hyperborea
jk alchemists plays up to 4, not 6
Well I figured I couldn't keep it there forever
Gaia Project is only 4 right?
I'll bring Viticulture just in case
With the time I'm going to get into the office today, there's no way I can make 5:30. 6:15ish would be the earliest I could do, so I'll have to skip out this week. Sorry :sadpotato:
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UDC03KCGK> <@UETS9HTSS> Since 2 people will be late today.  Do you want to something fast like go nuts for donuts/gizmos till the rest of the crew shows up and switch to something a little bit longer?
Given that you'll be there, I feel like the second game will need to be on the shorter side; ideas?
I was debating on skipping the 2nd game and grabbing the 7:30 train home
Could play an actual game of Race for the Galaxy in person
I'd also play Gizmos again or Quantum
we could also try out alchemist with 4
not sure how long that game is
Point is <@UDBGH9BMX> that looks like you won't have to skip, just show up late
And be mildly shamed
Liesss MODERATELY SHAMING SHALL COMMENCE!!! Also because you didn't bribe us with snacks like Marissa
I can't get shamed more than I do myself about showing up at 10:30
How do you even get away with that?
Don't you have standup?
I work as a bartender and show up to work before you...let that sink in
That's why I don't leave till after 6. And I don't usually do it, I just missed every bus/train I could today by 30 seconds
My standup is at 11:20
mine is at 9:30am
kinda wish mine was that early. I could show up at 11:00 and nobody would bat an eye
Interesting so if you had to be in earlier you would?
I just have to stop getting up so late, but stupid morning Dave isn't smart Dave
I'm still amazed it takes you an hour to get out of the house
85% of my morning routine is my shower
stupid morning Dave says it's okay to snooze the alarm, then circumvent the alarm that doesn't let you snooze it, set a timer, then increase the time on that timer another 10 minutes, then another 5 minnutes couldn't hurt, then sleep 3 minutes while that timer is going off
that's far beyond my multiple snoozes
Then it takes me at least an hour from "wake-up" to "be ready"
Morning Dave is just dumb
Tho I *did* cuddle with Tess for 10 minutes this morning which I really shouldn't have
Generally it's a single snooze and on my way
I did make the mistake of going to bed after midnight though
I wish that morning Dave was that smart
I think that night time dave is also not smart, he should be going to sleep earlier
not yesterday, but 2 days ago, Dave got to bed at 10:45, lights out by 11:09. It didn't help at all, despite that being &gt;8 hrs of sleep
How early did Evening Dave put Dave to bed?
And over the weekend, Dave got 8 hrs on Fri-&gt;Sat, then 9 hrs Sat-&gt; Sun
all this talk in third person is confusing
Consistency dave, it takes like 2 weeks to make a habit
Last night I did get to bed really late, but it doesn't help getting to bed earlier
CJ does not understand how brenden is confused
Not about the habit
Dakota is not confused, but is also not a fan of third person.
Was about how morning Dave was JUST as tired despite 3 days in a row of getting 8+ hrs
Cause we have to differentiate between morning Dave and normal Dave
What time are you getting up? Because it's super depressing when it's still dark out right now
which dave is the true dave tho
Maybe you need a light alarm
I have an alarm that makes me solve a math problem before I can shut it off
do you have blackout curtains? does your room get lighter in the morning?
I need to find a way to make my bedroom lights turn on in the morning
might want to let sunlight in if not
or just blink at me aggressively
They're not full blackout curtains
There's plenty of light in the morning
Holy fuck that is a lot of effort
It's not effort
My light switch could probably do it
Well, my light plug
The switch in my room doesn't affect any convenient outlet, so my main room light is a smart plug
No i meant literally ignoring this stuff so much that you need to find an app that you have to solve a math problem
Also, if you went to bed late the night before, the 3 days of good sleep ain't going to mean shit
I think it's more that 3 days of good sleep do not signify a pattern to your body
It's not a pattern, but I feel that my body should be plenty rested enough to wake up on time if I'd slept properly for 3 days in a row
And not this morning, but yesterday is what I was talking about, which is when I got up late even tho I went to bed early for the preceeding few days
But you're still late today, and went to bed late last night
And yeah, sleep is one of those things that if you fuck up too much, will haunt you for about 2 weeks. You'll feel "better" after a few days of more regular sleep, but not really in a good cycle until much later
:ah_hmmm:
Yea, I partly went to bed late last night bc the Sunday-&gt;Monday sleep didnt' bloody help at all
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o>
Watch
alright i got #1 down
alright #2 as well.
"Be well informed, while doing nothing"
"if you must contribute, do so only in meaningless token ways, and be disappointed in the lack of change"
Yeah, this video is pretty succinct
I appreciated it
does anyone want a copy of
Terraforming Mars: Preleude (Expansion only)
or
Century: Spice Road
?

I ended up with duplicates.
For free? Sure
yeah
Awesome thanks
I think just spice roads
which one? both?
k
Awe, I would have taken Spice Road
Dammit, and forgot to bring 7 Wonders to give away to Dave or Dakota
I need to bring in Race for the Galaxy for CJ
Doug is gonna bring in Centry Spice Road for Marissa
let's keep the chain going
Can I swap out one card that I creased from my copy of Race? :smile:
I forget which exit I'm supposed to leave from...
You on your way? 719 Boylston, near the library
Happy hour went a bit long great place on my way now
Good many shots did I finish for <@UDC4QL95G>?
a good many of them
Like 2?
After just one or two other drinks :wink:
Did you go to Park or did you go home?
he didn't believe me when I told him he more than one of my shots
we went to park. I think I left my jacket there. That or in the uber home
did you get him into an uber home? :laughing:
Canceled every Wednesday board game night? Or was that just for this week?
<@UETS9HTSS>
pretty sure it was this week
Ah, well that's good to know. Thanks for hosting so many of these!
<@UETS9HTSS> Could you send the invite to my personal google calendar, <mailto:revolution0007@gmail.com|revolution0007@gmail.com>?  Thanks!
So are we trying to do a game night this week?
Sounds like Brenden has something Wednesday. Hope it wasn't canceled just cause I can't make Wednesday this week.
Yep, I'm not free this Wednesday
Anyone up for a game after work? I have a group of three, so we can take 1 or 2 more people. I have Glass Road, Concordia, and Tzolkien
So....corona virus is NOT beer-transmitted?
Wrong channel?
looks like its spread in a similar way to the flu. Direct contact, sneezing, coughing, etc.
<@UHQD9J1SL> <@UDC03KCGK> <@UETS9HTSS> <@UDC4QL95G> <@UDBGH9BMX> <@UDDE5960N> @whoeverElse
Can't play on Tuesdays, thanks for the invite though!
There's no board game night tomorrow, correct? Since it's biweekly?
correct, this is an off-week
Only if <@UPGVCMGD9> is interested
I do need to get the jerky meat marinading though, so I need to do that first
<@UETS9HTSS> <@UPGVCMGD9> we were hoping to start around 5, if that affects your availability.
Thanks for the invite but back to work for me tonight
Yeah, it is biweekly. We've scheduled things in the off week before, but that is not a recurring thing by design
Nah I was planning on doing some stuff basic stuff tonight, like laundry!
I'd assume I won't be around for this
I wont be able to make it tonight either. Sorry
Would anyone be up for games on Thursday night?
I could do a game. Got one in mind?
Well, it seems like it would be at Wayfair because Doug is busy. As for the game, Gaia Project?
I might be in for a game
We can play other games too
Like you've never played Castles of Burgundy <@UETS9HTSS>
Playing Castles when I'm away is a great plan.
Dinner plans Thursday, if I get cancelled on again I might join.
Would anyone be interested in trying out BattleCon on Thursday? It's 1v1, but the games go pretty quick, and you could probably play more than one at a time
Well we were up for a game on Thursday and haven't picked a game. Not sure I want to do 1v1 though with 4 people. We tried that with TL and it didn't go so well
You can play 2 of them at the same time was my thought, but would understand otherwise
Guys I'm so disappointed in myself
I'm only the 283rd most active member of Wayfair slack
Oh I get how the logistics work, just that it's never as fun as it sounds on paper
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UETS9HTSS> <@UDBGH9BMX> so is tomorrow happening? Just want to confirm for scheduling
I'd probably not be able to leave the office till 6ish cause I'm coming in late on Friday bc I have to renew my license
And I'm not staying late on Friday haha
So you'd borrow time Thursday to pay for Friday?
Do your bosses track your time that closely <@UDBGH9BMX>? Mine were always "As long as the work gets done, I don't care how long you are here"
Nah, they don't track it at all afaik. But I'd feel bad if I worked like half a day and didn't take vaca for it, and I'm sure as heck not gonna take vaca for the few hrs of updating my license
I used to feel the same way. Then I got over it. Then I got fired. Lot happened in between all that, but I'm certainly not in a position to say where the slope happened
yea, I don't really ever want to get into that apathy. I think a lot of that comes when you just don't care as much about the job/what you're doing
It's what happened at my previous company. They loved me the whole time mainly bc I was good friends with my boss, but I was just tired of doing what I was doing there
Some days I'd just... not do anything but browse reddit cause I couldn't work up the desire to get any work done. That's when I knew I needed to get a new job
So, game night tonight or no? Can still play with 3
Anyone up for a game tonight?
I can do game night
Are we doing my place?
If you're willing. Otherwise Wayfair is fine
Should we pick a game?
`I used to feel the same way. Then I got over it. Then I got fired.`

Chuckled at that
Well, my grandmother just passed, so I need to figure out when I need to head to NY for the funeral; if I need to pack tonight to leave tomorrow morning, I won't be able to do games tonight
Sorry to hear that
Oh, sorry for your loss Brenden
thanks
this won't conflict
earliest the wake will be is next thursday it seems
Thanks for letting us know. Hopefully games will be a good way to take your mind off of it.
As for game options, I haven't played Gizmos, Gaia Project, or Castles of Burgundy in white some time. 
I also brought Viticulture if we wanted to give that a try
I'd prefer we don't play Gizmos
considering the other options
open to the other three
I am more inclined to play Gaia Project over Burgundy, though I would not be opposed to Burgundy since Brenden hasn't played yet. There is also that new Centry game right? A new world or something. Playing a full game of Great Western Trail would also be good.
 If Drew and I still arrive at 5:30, we can do a round of Gizmos before Dave arrives.
I do have Century: A New World
open to that in addition to the other three
It's okay, I probably shouldn't go tonight anyway - would get home really late if I don't leave the office till 6. Would mess everyone else up with timing also
so what's the plan then <@UDC03KCGK> <@UDC4QL95G>
5:30 works for me. No strong opnions on how long of a game we play. As usual, I am partial to something new, but I'm happy to play any of the games listed so far
I can do 5:30-8:30
Might struggle with Gaia then. Burgundy is a long game if i remember correctly as well
We can fit Gaia in I believe. Burgundy for sure since you and I play fast in that game now
Again, for the record, I'd like to state that I'm very impressed by how fast Drew was in Hyperborea
I'm slow with new games. Once I've played it once or twice I'm much more normal speed. Should see me in Race
Drew and CJ both move at a nice pace in race :ok_hand:
Running late because work kept me late. I'll be there by 6
I'm not sure my head is in a place where I want to learn something new and complicated
So you guys should play Spirit Island then
I've never played
Nor do I own it
Gaia project would feel like a relearn. Open to literally any game
What about on Saturday afternoon/evening??
I think I am hosting a group so trying to get an idea of numbers
I'll be out of town. Thanks for the invite though
Game night is tomorrow though.
I don't think I should host tomorrow
Also, I may not be able to make it
Uh oh, you feeling sick already?
I'm also out for tomorrow
technically I'm double booked
recurring calendar invite coincided with another game related thing: mega-civ
Are Wednesdays harder for people to make than Tuesdays?
I know it is easier for Dave to make, but I don't have feedback from anyone else
<https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/184424/mega-civilization>
It should be the same for me
This is just poor planning on my part
I scheduled this early Jan and didn't think about game night
well, I'm not sure we had moved to wednesdays when I scheduled this actually
I totally spaced on this, I'm doing dinner with my mentor next wednesday.... because I'm a full on space cadet for some reason this week
So I lied, i'm in for tomorrow!
That's ok, I'm just trying to figure out the best night for game night.
As an ongoing thing
Also I can't make it tomorrow, so you not being able to host shouldn't be a problem. People could literally just play at the office
I can do thursdays, except for the last thursday of the month
I can't do every other tuesday
I have no other pre planned things that interfere with this, just :dnd: on sunday's
I also have D&amp;D on Sundays
I thought that was day you dropped because it was silly early in th morning
Once upon a time, that was true
In October 2018, I started a Sunday afternoon campaign
So CJ your answer is just "all of the days?"
Yea pretty much
<@UPGVCMGD9> <@UDC4QL95G> still need your votes
Though not gonna get Marissa's till she's out of work in all likelihood
My answer is the same as CJ
And <@UDD45P5A9> if you think you have a grasp on availability from new contract
anyone around for a game of concordia or glass road tonight? I'm trying to get one going with work people. but they are being wishy-washy, so some slots open
Is this a forever best night or a this week?
No friends :'(
Anyone want to join/meet my friends??
Forever a best night, those not able to keep the commitment will be beaten regularly
I would love to play glass road, but have D&amp;D tonight
the beatings will continue until morale improves
Well in that case, I can't commit to the same day free every week, but generally could make mon-wed work
But yeah, this is very much a "what night of the week works best on an ongoing basis"
I have work
I am also busy. :sorry:
So by this tally, Wednesday is still the best day
games tonight? We have it scheduled. Just confirming if we're still planning to do it.
No <@UETS9HTSS> made game plans without any of us
oh
Drew also has plans so that would make you me, <@UDC4QL95G> and maybe <@UPGVCMGD9>?
We could play CJ's copy of Brass.
Ohhh I definitely want to play brass but I have a work event tonight
I played last weekend :) it was great
But Saturday?? Guys?
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UDDE5960N> three player game tonight?
I don't think I'm free Saturday
My copy of brass is at home
eh, ok. something else? Grab one of Corin's games?
It's a 6 hour + game anyway, we started at 2 and left at 9/10
what?
BGG says 90-120 minutes
I don't think that is anywhere near accurate. Maybe if everyone moves without thinking?
ok, still, we could play Lorenzo
Maybe per player, that I would believe
or Gizmos or Modern Art
well <@UDC4QL95G> needs to weigh in
<@UDC4QL95G>
Yeah I can play something today
Is there something you would prefer to play?
It's also worth noting that to get to corin's shelf all of playing would have to leave our building
I have Tzolk'n and Eminant domain (with expansion) in the office
walking to Copley is not that big a deal
I'm lazy doug, SOOO LAZY
Tzolk'n is good, but I've played it pretty recently
Those are the most interesting games I have in the office. Corin's shelf is probably our best bet unless there is something good on 2
I have the TIME game you guys got me, king of new york
Oh I'd totally be down to try TIME
sure, let's try it
<@UDL020K8D> FYI
:bus:
:bbourdeau:
Wait, I might get to meet Victoria?
Accurate
What are friends for right?
Only the gods will tell
We haven't met?
Maybe the gods will allow it soon
Not that I can recall?
Marissa you're not doing it right
It goes

<@UDL020K8D> <@UDC4QL95G> what time do you want to get together?
5?
Sure. Where
F3
I'll check if Scuba is free.
Tsunami is
Scuba's super busy
Scuba is open. 
What are you talking about CJ?
On the calendar Scuba has a 5, a 5:30, and a 6
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'm good with it if it's actually open
I just reserved it on the iPad. Who knows. 
We shall find out!
Scuba Dakota, at 5 be there or be :black_square:
CJ I hope you know how to play
Nope! We'll all learn the hard way
Captain Sonar is available for $24 at Walmart if we could ever get 8 ppl for a game
I played Captain Sonar last week. 4 people, played it turned based.
Still pretty nail-biting.
I own it if we want to do a large game night at some point
We are 100% sure that you have Captain Sonar not just Sonar? I know Dakota had a mix up with this at the Barnes and Noble sale
Yeah he has the 8 player game. I also don't think my copy of Sonar ever arrived...
I should look into that
Cause it is like a top end 8 player game. Which Avalon and Secret Hitler peak at 7 for me. Or 10 for Avalon (can't catch them all if you don't watch the votes). Spyfall...is Spyfall, so that'll always be in the running for any player count of 4-8
you mean spyfall is the best game, at any player count from 4-8, and still pretty good at 9-10 if you have spyfall 2.
I don't like spyfall nearly as much as Doug
I have Captain Sonar
The 8 player version, not base sonar

what is the best way to interact with these threads? I'd play basically any of these games, just a matter of availability.
state your interest in the thread
so you'll get notifications
then with the group of people interested, we'll coordinate a date/time

+5
need room for that massive ego?
or what's the rationale?

Well you know, I wouldn't have a perfect 7 way split of personalities, but there's got to be more than just the 3.

I definitely added myself to this list but I don't see my +1

If we're talking about ego +19

So now what? Every one of those options has interest enough to be scheduled

Sorry, I would be almost any other Friday, but I'm so tired bc I stayed out too late last night
I am free!
<@UDDE5960N> how's that maybe looking?
reaching out to <@UK7V13DS7>
We're playing at your house Brenden?
I'd have to ask my roomamtes
But that's potentially an option
Where are you thinking about then?
Mei's curious
I'm ok with options
My place, Wayfair, somewhere else
open to ideas
I'm in
:tada:
Mei just might become a blob somewhere near by
:blob_spy:
Dakota is dead to the world
Sounds like between 3-5 players depending on the status of Marissa and Dakota
Marissa is quarantined
Really?????
Does she have the coronovirus?
Yes, and by that, I mean she's sick and don't want her getting the three of us sick
<@UDC4QL95G>
Nice
Alright so 3-4
I cannot be sick. I'm not allow drugs.
Hmmm not tonight. I need to get some shit done, and If I play games, there is very little chance I will do any of it
What are the chances you get that stuff done if you don't play games?
Higher
How much are we reducing the probability?
uhh probably like 70% chance I get it done if I don't play games
by like 1%? 10%? 25%?
and if you do play games?
Virtually 0 if I play games
:sad_blob:
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDC03KCGK>
Terraforming Mars
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDC03KCGK>
<@UDC03KCGK> note that century will not take long at all, we might be able to do that AND something else
I'm ok with a new world, but the century games always feel like multiplayer solitaire to me.
I'm looking for a shorter game night because Sam is only busy till like 6, then I'm going to games tomorrow
Do you really need them done?
Yeah
Espeically if I want to wear clean clothes tomorrow
LOL!
:twinsies:
I nominate Wayfair and Hanabi then
But I'm good with a short game
Trains are 6:15 and 6:55 for what we're talking about
Thoughts plans suggestions? Drew's 6ish end time means we need to kick this off closer to 5
Hmm; this is not what I was expecting
I nominate Wayfair and Century
though I'll need to head home to grab the game and bring it here
Copley I assume?
that's my current thought
:thumbsup:
<@UDC03KCGK> does that work for you?
:crickets:
<@UDC03KCGK>
I'm just arriving back at the office
leaving boly now
Heading up to 7 to find a table
7 was a mistake
Looking for a conference room
Lol
Heading to Copley
Behind the 5th floor kitchen in tapestry
Where are you <@UDC03KCGK>
On a train almost at Hynes
Sorry almost at Copley
In the mall. Someone gonna sign me in?
<@UDDE5960N> <@UETS9HTSS>
On my way
it sound like you should go shopping :)
Are we doing games this Sunday?
if non-gloom people want to play, we're doing games
we could
otherwise we're doing gloomhaven
<@UHQD9J1SL>? you in?
if we get 6 we could play viticulture
i dont know what gloomkhaven is , also id be in for @wayfair or close by games
cool. so we're at 6 people
Brenden's place is very close. we could also do @wayfair
Assuming Dakota and Drew are in
they were in for gloom
so I assume they're in
I will play on Wednesday but I will be joining late (8)
noooooooooooo am i ruining your plans?
nah, I planned gloom as a backup
6 on time, 7 later. ok, we can work with that. I still suggest viticulture
whats 'on time'?
First, always deflect blame to CJ
5:30?
when do you get out of work?
I like the idea of viticulture
Clearly double booking dedicated game night is a silly idea
Well, the four of us were going to play a game. just depended which game
:suspicious:
Well I am around, but that's a lot of people so I'd be fine ducking out
And I make it later anyway
I mean, you could get to work at a time that allows you to show up for games at 5:30?
:doubt: :but: :maybe:
I have to pass :disappointed:
Do thursday!
can you do your gloomhaven wednesday and regular games thursday?
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDBGH9BMX> <@UPGVCMGD9>?
I personally cannot join on Thursday
<@UTFFJEJ6P>?
sounds like we have Marissa, CJ, Caroline, and possible Dave for Wednesday. We should still do game night.
I know Aysh is trying to get Thursday to happen as well. so maybe between everyone we can get two nights to work.
Cannot join on Thursday
Sorry <@UHQD9J1SL> did that poll to figure out which day worked best, and Wednesday won. So I don't have Thursdays off as a result
ah :disappointed: ok!!!
I'm around, but probably couldn't get there till 6 at the earliest, and I don't want to force y'all to play a bigger game
maybe i can come next wednesday then :slightly_smiling_face:
I've got a friend from work who will be joining us. She has a friend that might be coming too on the later side (seeing as Marissa is coming at 8). 
<@UDBGH9BMX> this means you should be good no matter when you want to show
I haven't played an Avalon, Spyfall, or Secret Hitler in some time
CAPTAIN SONAR!
also, what's our player count up to now?
Depends on what time of the night your referring to
max player count for the evening
Gloom Crew + CJ + Dave + Drew's Friend + Drew's Friend's Friend +  Marissa = 9
Aysh also said she was a maybe.
<@UETS9HTSS> if this is more people than you want in your apartment, we can move it to Wayfair.
Might be a good idea. Could hook a switch up with Jackbox or something to the big tv when everybody arrives
good idea.
I mean it's also worth noting that Marissa+Drew and Crew will probably being going in different directions with me
As they'll be showing up at 8 when I'll be leaving
Also worth noting that didn't brenden's roommates ask politely nothing after like 9? on a week night?
Yeah, was thinking we could move this to wayfair given the size
I can book a conference room
cool
Boyl or Copley though
but that means we need to decide on games I should bring from home
I vote copley
I vote Drew decides, as he is in neither building
Copley has more beer
9th floor never runs out of beer
nobody goes up there
and there aren't enough people on 9 and 10 to tap the kegs
I vote for Copley because I'm in Copley :smile:
there's a nice conference room right behind the 5th floor kitchen in Copley we could use
Works for me. 
Copley does not have more beer, I'm with Dakota Boylston kicks less often
Hey, been talking to a few ppl and we're considering going to Lucky Strike on Thurs for the $15 arcade (I talked in <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> about that, right)? Would anyone else I haven't talked to be interested in that?
Huh. Bit of a logistical problem. It's one thing for me to go to Wayfair, it's another to be "Hey, come to my old office to play games with people you haven't met yet!"
She'd be showing up at 5:30 like I would but her friend would be showing up on the later side if he's even coming.
As far as which building to go to, Copley is way better for me than Boylston
How is that any different than "Hey, come to my friend's house that you have never met, play games with people you haven't met yet!" Having them meet at a public mall in the office sounds better imo
Introduce them to Dakota first, so he is inviting all of them directly.
It's one thing to be like "Hey my friends and I have a game night at their house" as opposed to "hey my friends do a game night at my old office" 
It's just abnormal and a bit weird.
Just don't tell them it's your old office
Just tell them "Hey my friends and I have a game night, and due to the expected size, we decided to book a conference room at their office."
Best way to handle it
Coworker didn't even begin to be phased and was excited by free beer
phoebe is going to join
Did somebody bring in a switch?
I HAVEN'T SEEN PHEOBE IN FOREVER!!!
Not here
There are a TON of people coming, should we order pizza or something?
I can grab my switch at lunch today.
:sweet:
I'll just have to download jackbox.
do we need any games brought in?
I can venmo you a few $ if you have to buy it
eh, I'll always have it as an option for people, so I'm fine grabbing it myself.
Mario Party is probably a good one to have
well, I brought in a bunch of games:
&gt; Captain Sonar
&gt; Quantum
&gt; Decrypto
&gt; Not Alone
&gt; Queendomino
&gt; Condontierre
&gt; Go Nuts For Donuts
&gt; Sequence
I soooo wanna do Captain Sonar
do we have Avalon and Spyfall?
also I booked Cop05-T4-Tapestry
Guarantee there's a copy of Avalon in the office
We have anything that is already in copley as well, so both Avalon and SH should be there
so I should bring all my controllers too then.
I have secret hitler, there's a new copy in boly
I have Deception: Murder in Hongkong at my desk
and Telestrations (telephone pictionary)
oh and magic maze :red-pawn:
Games I have at my desk:
&gt; Deception: Murder in Hongkong
We could also ask drew to bring Two Rooms and a Boom
are you carrying those over to copley?
<@UDC03KCGK>
Monikers and Shit Happens are very small, so i'll bring those. The rest by request
well, two rooms take of gets good at 11, which I still don't think we have
If we really want to play video games instead, I have access to a gaming computer in Copley
So we don't have to do switch. But I don't have controllers here for it
That or we just be happy with Jackbox, which is is also totally fine
Also, I brought Avalon and When I Dream into the office
I have no problem grabbing them, I'm just glad you said something because I probably wouldn't have.
Good point, I'd say Jackbox as a good option for many people, mario party is probably more of a video game night type of game
Yea, Jackbox is really as close to a "video game" as I'd prefer for a game night, but I'm open to anything
For me, board game nights are my attempts to get AWAY from screens that I look at for 90% of my life nowadays :smile:
Yes, but wouldn't that violate keto?
I'll bring Spyfall
We're close at the moment
I can bring it just in case
I don't have to eat it
I'd rather not play Jackbox when an actual board game suffices. Jackbox is usually what I bust out at parties where about half the group don't play games like we do. Hell, Mario Party, Overcooked, and things like that I enjoy with this group as far as the video game side goes
Oh, I played some Unrailed with Brian last night. That game is actually a ton of fun - I think y'all will really like it when we plan a video game night
1. PhoebeDakota
Dave
Doug
Drew
Brenden
Marissa
Emma (bartender)
Emma's friend
CJ
I miss anyone?
Then we get into complexity bc people are showing up at different times
Indeed.
I think <@UHQD9J1SL> was a Maybe
Mei will probably join but not participate
also <@UTFFJEJ6P>
:heck:
<@UDC03KCGK> I'm going to try to register visitors in advance
I need names
Andrew Carleton
Emma NewComb
:loading:
The :loading: emoji is great and I'm glad Brenden has brough it out more often lately
actually, it's shit
one sec
:resolved:
ugh
i fixed that one ages ago at wayfair
there we go; dark mode friendly
now actually :resolved:
what's emma's friend's name?
I have tortuga lol
Still working on it, haven't heard back yet
We were just talking about Tortuga the other day
I have a dashpass if we want to order food
(no delivery fee, minimal service charge on doordash for many restaurants)
I wouldn't worry about it Brenden
During working hours they're way more anal than after hours
just trying to expedite the process
and have badges waiting
True, but i'm lazy
you don't have to do anything
since I'm handling it
This is why I like bolyston, WAY less security
I'm just saying it's not worth worrying about
Edited
just for that, I listed you as a secondary contact for the visitors <@UDDE5960N>
Can I make the security desk ping <@UDDE5960N>?
probably
ewwwwwwww
I"m coming to visit too
Yea I'm just gonna deal with you the old fashion way and hope the guard doesn't give a shit
ok
Jack box 6 downloading. Both it and Mario kart and party play up to 8. 
What's on 6? 3 is the most popular with the groups I've played with, so I'm unfamiliar what is on some of the later ones
I'd be down for food. Pizza was mentioned
No idea. I just thought I was supposed to get the latest one. 
Oh, yeah they are all just different games
We’ll find out. 
Some of the later versions have updated games of previous versions, but they aren't a straight "update" per se
I've heard that 6 is one of the better ones
I've only played 3 tho
That's good news
:hello-there: 
:welcome:
Hiya!
Chaos monkey is the very active channel. This one is much quieter until basically the day a game comes up
What's our target time to start
It's also worth noting that no bots are active in this channel
Depends on who's getting fired
Yeah, bots changed the game for this slack
It's all Dave's fault
I'm on a train
So hopefully around 5:30 there are people who are ready to play
Dave you won't get fired and it won't happen till tomorrow
I don't really know how, but I'll accept the blame
Das fine
:blob-doubt:
Better make that linkedin. You're clearly in the headspace that you'll never feel secure in this job. Just not healthy
lol
dw, I'm in a headspace where I'll never feel secure in any job :smile:
I don't think Dave feels secure in any job
Yup
:got-em:
Well you started the ping wars that famous day
That day so long ago
Hmmm, I suppose that is true
Although credit to dave I think megamoji existed before then
That's just when we got the idea that bots pinging people would be hilarious
The first one was to ping me like, every post or smth, wasn't it?
No it always random chance that it would ping you on a thread
Which then became ping anyone not on a thread
Nah, it would ping me on a % after every threaded message I'm pretty sure. Cause I didn't have a problem being on chaos seed with the group ping
It was just when I'd keep getting pinged that I had an issue
No I'm saying after we built that one that pinged you randomly we decided that pinging everyone not in a thread would be fun too
ah, ya
Anyone want to try When I Dream?
Am now in Cop05-T4-Tapestry
Can I just check in? Or do you still have to come down?
I think someone has to come down?
I can't leave games here though
Perhaps wait for CJ and Dakota
definitely check in though
I'm gonna test it
Yeah they checked for your name and didn't find anything. So not sure what the point of that waa
my PM's manager (l5) just took her aside to talk and i NEED TO KNOW
they should be checking for your name
not mine
interesting
I can come down now though
still need me?
Waiting for the orange line should be here soon still doing games??
Yes. 
:welome:
Any game night plan this week?
Wednesday is free for me.
And this is how you get double booked
Double booked?
Gloomhaven is a backup if no game night happens wednesday.
Game night takes presidence
I'm also free this Wednesday
I can play games
Wednesday games yay!
Yeah, Gloomhaven is usually the backup on game night nights.
So which game Wednesday? We had an opportunity for Captain Sonar which was unfortunate to watch pass by
Depends how many people we have coming.  
If we end up with the 4 from gloomhaven plus Victoria and Aysh, that’s 6, could captain sonar. 

Or viticulture or lords of Waterdeep 
Haven't played Viticulture yet. Does Brass play 6?
Brass plays 4 I believe
Brass plays 4, that is right. 
Alright, well Captain Sonar and one of the other 2 games is a good slate
Do we have <@UDDE5960N> as well? That’d be 7. 
<@UHQD9J1SL> do you think you’re in for Wednesday?
Yes I'll make it!
Wait, too many people?
No, everything is fine. 
No matter what we get we’ll find something to play. 

And I don’t actually know if we have CJ. 
Dawww I want cj and Mei!
Hopefully he’s in. But either way, don’t worry about too many people. 

If we get a large group we just might do it at WF to avoid Brenden’s roommates hating him. 
I'm ok with Copley again.
They keep forgetting to lock the kegs, so I keep helping out and changing them
<@UDDE5960N> ?
Oh I'm in
Forgot sorry
Ok, that makes 7. So we’ll have to grab stuff that works for that. 
I’ll bring citadels at least. 
<@UPGVCMGD9> makes 8 for Captain Sonar
I don't think Marissa is joining
back to 7.
Honestly it isn't hard to do two roles in Captain Sonar if you do engineer and first mate together
we could try thaqt
WE MUST FIND ANOTHER! <@UTX6E7LLU> or <@UTFFJEJ6P>!
I can play till about 7:45 if that helps with the numbers
I have no idea, but I like your style!
<@UETS9HTSS> would you prefer we do this at your place or at WF tonight?
Capitan sonar would certainly be easier at Wayfair
When we go above 5-6 I'll always prefer Wayfair
Sounds good! Copley or Boylston?
Copley!
:innocent:
Copley is always preferred
CJ is also now here
The status quo is shifting!
Lunch games are back!
:kermit:
To be fair, it's fun at your place for the smaller nights, even if we start doing Gloomhaven at Copley for space reasons.
I do prefer my place when feasible
My table doesn't really support more than 5-6 people though
Don't think Wayfair would take kindly to me shaking drinks in conference rooms
Maybe I can get a team to hire me to do a private bartending pod outing?
Wait... why wouldn't wayfair take kindly to shaking drinks in conference rooms?
I'd hire you, except that a decent number of people on my team don't drink
No one cares if you mixed drinks at wayfair, it's just a pain to get the appropriate tools here.
Drew's a bartender now. He keeps a full bar in his back pocket
:magic:
You should start a new tradition in your office then
You and the spiders
I don't know there's not real people in your office all that often
Trying to catch up, games tonight at Copley?
I'll also need someone to get me through security at 530/545 ish due to train
I also have no clue how to read/understand reactions on mobile, so imma assume someone is going to break me in at the appropriate time tonight
ping us in this channel when you arrive
we'll come down to let you in
Sweet, will do
Dinner ordering for tonight?
Pain and suffering are on the menu tonight season with a heavy dose of taunting
*seasoned
and Beer
I like to say marinated in beer
thoughts on where to order from?
I have food for myself, so count me out for ordering
by a weak little baby, you're right this does summarize your life
I let you beat on my ribs externally
we do not _*need*_ you, but of course if you want to swing by that's great
Brenden- give us some options are we an vote
*can
<@UETS9HTSS> youve ordered from a really nice mediterranenan/ lebanese place once...starts with M- do you remember that?
something 'shalla///
i confused Anoush'eela and MAhershala ali....I mean Anoushella
anoushella?
yeah, that place is decent
WTF is red white?
japanese vegan stuff
pretty good miso curry with veggies
Hmmmmm like Japanese not sure about not having meat
I actually can't have meat today
What time are we starting tonight?
WEDNESDAY!
Same time we always do Pinky
why can't you have meat today? (out of curiosity)
oh, is today ash wednesday?
is that a no meat day?
CJ VOTE!
Brenden VOTE
5:30
I voted, and I'm not voting for anoushella
not in the mood for it
nor for the delivery fees
yes, traditionally Ash Wednesday calls for no meats for Catholics. That then extends to all Fridays in Lent
:i_voted:
you hadnt voted when I asked you to :disappointed:
Also yeah- maybe next time
We need a tie breaker
<@UK7V13DS7> Red and White or Thai basil?
I was just letting you know I did, no :shots-fired:
same :point_up:
Its ok- not like my heart broke or anything  :crying:
I vote for whichever option someone else is willing to pick up :evil-hands:
Which is closer?
Well half of you are already at Wayfair!
Half of us have always been at wayfair?
I'm at wayfair but not copley
It'
Thai Basil it is!
Drew's not there
For wayfairians
Once wayfairian always wayfairian
Well both Drew and Victoria are coming from non wayfair locations and need to be swiped in
<https://www.beyondmenu.com/20003/boston/thai-basil-boston-02116.aspx>
So that's half. Me doug Drew victoria
All non-copley wayfairians
Boooooooo
Beef fried rice normal spicy, here
Woah, that's more than I was expecting from a pad Thai. I'm going to pass then. Sorry if I fucked up the vote as a result
are you talking about price <@UDC03KCGK>?
And yes, I'm Catholic. No, I don't not eat meat on Fridays anymore because A) that's actually optional post Vatican 2. B) I think it is bullshit and doesn't actually do anything to make me feel better on a spiritual level in the same way as the rest of Let's traditions.
Thank you Daka
what if we do beantown pho and grill?
<@UETS9HTSS> i'm guessing the same conference room on 5?
<https://www.beyondmenu.com/32541/boston/beantown-pho-and-grill-boston-02116.aspx>
pricing seems more reasonable there
I didn't book anything
but sure, let's do that
<@UDC03KCGK>
That does seem better, if even only a couple bucks. I just looked at Thai Basil's Pad Thai without meat and went "well that's how much it normally is with the meat!"
I feel like they raised pricing since I last ordered from there :thinking-tilted:
I'm going to place an order from there
Anyone else that wants stuff from there should also do so
Either I or someone else will pick up the food
<@UDDE5960N>
beef thai fried rice?
Are we still doing Thai basil?
indonesian fried rice?
beantown pho &amp; grill
similar, but cheaper
<https://www.beyondmenu.com/32541/boston/beantown-pho-and-grill-boston-02116.aspx>
I can put you on my order if you'd like
or you can place your own
<@UHQD9J1SL> interested?
Yes gimme a minute
no worries, place an order for yourself separately, we can have one person pick up multiple orders
Did you order for me? Otherwise I'm good
I haven't ordered yet
so I can include you if you like
but it sounds like you don't want me to
I just want to order soon
Add me to yours i would like Drunk noodles instead please (new place)
sounds good cj
Yeah, I'll pass then. Thank you though
<@UDDE5960N> beef still?
yes
Although just normal is fine, just let mei know how much I owe you otherwise I'm giving you paper money
<@UHQD9J1SL> I can add yours to my order if you like
but I need an order soon
:dollar:
I'll request from Mei
placing the order in like 2 minutes
almost decided!
k I'll wait
<@UDDE5960N> willing to grab this on your way over?
or did you leave already?
WTF?
I work in your building
oh yeah
lol
pad kra praw
:facepalm:
We need an <@UDC4QL95G> on this!
<@UHQD9J1SL> tofu?
chicken?
chicken :see_no_evil:
white rice? noodle? brown rice? (the latter 2 are +$1)
white is good@!
order is placed
gracias! venmo por favor
7*11
<@UDD45P5A9> <@UDC03KCGK> ETA?
3 minutes
Still in cambridge due to red line delays, meaning no trains moving currently
Alright I'll sit here till drew comes
1 minute
Here
Claimed tapestry
I can pick up food, but I don't want to leave my stuff in tapestry unguarded
Unless someone wants to pick up food, I'm waiting until person number 2 arrives to go get it
Just left to get food
coming
<@UTFFJEJ6P> you still on for tonight?
Okay, just got off the train, so ETA 5 mins?
Lies!!!!
Blame red traffic lights
when?
I'm out of town this weekend. have fun!
Already have plans with Sam for tomorrow night. I will schedule a video game night one of these weekends for us at some point
so when are we playing clank?
When are we playing brass?
We have quite the list right now. 
When are we playing Fury of Dracula
And Roots
and Wingspan
What is roots?
who owns roots?
I didn't think we had a copy
Ben owns root
Dave I think?
Dave alos
I thought dave only owned spirit island
Super hard to describe. Watch a youtube video on it.
The game is entirely asymmetrical from player to player. Each player has different means of scoring points and interacting with pretty much every aspect of the game, players, and boards
It is a territory control game at it's core, but not every faction is even capable of holding land
Isn't it just Root?
maybe
maybe ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
He talks about it a lot. 
<@UDBGH9BMX> so you own Root?
Sounds cool. 
Well, to be fair, we've successfully had 2 game nights back to back where we had a lot of people. Good problem to have, but still a logistical problem for playing these longer games with smaller player counts.
I guess we will just have to have more game nights.
I don't, no. I played it once and it was pretty cool - need the right group for it tho
i haven't played brass yet! unfortunately i never have time anymore. Social life too busy between Salsa lessons, friends and dates X_X
Sounds like a good problem to have
haha, kind of is :slightly_smiling_face:
We could also break into smaller groups if we want to play smaller games but still be in the same space. Could I invite Kiara to the next game night?
For sure
yes to smaller groups. yes to kiara
When we know it is going to be at wayfair, it is probably worth mentioning that it is happening in the wayfair channel. We used to ping the channels a while back, but that kinda petered out when we stopped lacking people to play with consistently
and some weren't too eager to play games in the building anymore either
NO TO KIARA!!!
Kidding- she fun
Salsa lessons? I want in
I’m playing Clank right now. 
We played a game at pax. It was pretty darn cool
Dakota strategy never leave
I lost by 1 point
how was it?
I enjoyed it drew fucked up and forced himself to lose
I liked it. 
Well you know, learned a lot about how scoring works and that a speed build isn't a great strategy
Better than that time you learned about scoring in Go nuts for doughnuts?
Your problem is your speed strategy had no speed
&gt; please only extend invitations for external visitors for business critical reasons
sounds like WF might not want us bringing in external guests for a little while, until the covid-19 thing boils over.
I for one will continue to ignore this during non working hours.  That being said I think in the near future we'll probably avoid getting together for a while
Why, because of <@UDC4QL95G> and his cough?
Or me and my scary European travel?
No, I just figure if we end up WFH no one will be centralized enough.  Nevermind if they actual institute a quarantine say by shutting down the T.
I didn't get the email :white_frowning_face:
They're trying to tell you something Aysh
I've been quarantined!
What's the subject
Gimme email!
Email given
Saw email. Was boring.
Yes and useless
Are we doing game night tomorrow?
I'm free to do so should we choose to do it
where should we do it? I don't think we should sign anyone into Wayfair tomorrow
I agree
Also depends on how many people we have for it
My place only really comfortably supports 5, maybe 6
I could do it, but I'm further away.
do we just have 5?
<@UHQD9J1SL> you want to join?
Viticulture plays up to 6.
Have a dance thing all week 
cool.
do any other of our new games play 5?
Most of them? Brenden has viticultural
is that true? Dungeon Petz and Brass and other Brass don't
and clank doesn't
I thought brass did 5?
nope. 4.
Viticulture is 2-6
right,I noted that before this thread
We could do power grid
no
Forbidden sky
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I'd prefer not
I forgot who ended up with hyperion
Apparently hyperion is not the right name
I have hanabi too, I don't really care though
hyperborea?
Yes that word
Also 2-6
I do not have Viticulture
Drew then?
<@UDC03KCGK> viticulture?
I own Viticulture but my flight lands today around 6pm. I'd certainly be willing to loan it but don't think that works out for you all timeline wise.
Oh, we don’t have Drew. Let’s play Clank or brass. 
I'd vote clank as i'm not totally up to a super heavy game today
Let’s play clank. 
I can teach it as well so we don't have to worry about all of us going in blind
and cj
Have fun! Wish I could join, but alas, I'll probably be in the middle of going through border control or customs around that time.
I’ve played it before as well. 
oh yeah you posted that you were playing it last week
where are we playing this evening
Is the current assumption my place?
that was my assumption
ahh perfect
clank!
I have the recurring meeting on my calendar with my roommates invited
so I don't need to worry about late notice
Will you be quarantine when you come back?
So some hometown friends and I are going to new orleans for a bachelor party in may
someone wants to throw a parade for the bachelor
it'll cost $1500-$1800
That seems like a lot for a very short amount of time
huh???
lol
:homer-disappear:
what
i get that you deleted your messaged but where did mine go
Yo, i'm gonna have to back out of games tonight. :sorry:
why dakaaaaaaaa
I been working since 6:00AM due to a product launch and am kinda just mentally done with today
ohh
Which would have been fine, had i gone to sleep at a reasonable time expecting to be woken up so early
well, clank! still works with 3.
go to sleep Dakota
:salute_cap:
Do we want to just call it off?
Clank was still very good with 3
Who's our third?
<@UDDE5960N>?
CJ Drew Doug
<@UDDE5960N>?
<@UDDE5960N> (?) Brendan Doug
drew is out
Cj You Doug :lol:
<@UDDE5960N>
we just like pinging you
Clank isn't too long of a game either so <@UDDE5960N> should have no problems hitting his train
right <@UDDE5960N>
that seems reasonable for <@UDDE5960N>
<@UDDE5960N> is typically fine if he doesn't have to hit the 10:00
honestly I'm hoping for a game night on the shorter side
Then Clank is a good choice
If we sarted like... now I'd join. but i'm gonna be dead in 2 hours :lol:
clank!
eh, honestly, I could start a game like now-ish
I can probably do 4 pm
I have a 4
I'm fine with doing the 3 of us for clank too.  Mei has to get me off the train so earlier is also better
<@UDC4QL95G> how long did clank take us? Like a half hour?
Somehting like that. And that was with learning the game.
Dont worry about me, i'm heading home now anyway
Ok :disappointed: Up to <@UETS9HTSS> and <@UDL020K8D> if they want to game tonight
let's play clank!
I'm already home
so there's that
would you be ok with a 4:30 game start?
my meetings end in 6 minutes
I could probably get away with doing that
ok, <@UDDE5960N> let's head to Brenden's after your 4. let me know when you're heading over.
Don't forget I'm coming from Copley now
I forgot. Still, let me know. 
I need to go buy some groceries
:hmm:
I guess I'll go after you guys leave?
I'm ready to go if you want to head out
I’m here now. 
Sorry, went early. 
Ohhhh ok
<@UETS9HTSS> <@UDL020K8D> either of you want something from star market?
hell yeah
Well?
4 english cucumbers and chinese black vinegar if they have it
if they don't, then balsamic vinegar
Knorr Granulated Bouillon Chicken
WTF IS AN ENGLISH CUCUMBER? Your just getting normal ones
they're fucking next to each other
english motherfucker
can you read it
Is this a shopping list cause I'm the wrong person to send on this mission ask <@UK7V13DS7>
no worries if you're not willing
I'll go get shit afterwards if you don't feel like it
this is the chinese name of the vinegar:
Chinese Chinkiang (or Zhenjiang) black vinegar
don't know what'll be on the package
Is it in the Chinese or vinegar section?
My guess is chinese
You're getting balsamic because that's all I could find
<@UETS9HTSS> there's only cubed do you want it
<@UETS9HTSS> CJ sucks at shopping!!! hahahaha He may get you zucchini instead of cucumber
<@UDDE5960N> take the earlier train please 6:50 or 7:30pm
Will do my best
So Doug and I were talking
With the WFH stuff starting, we were thinking about playing some online games together
Seeking suggestions:
Diablo II + LOD Expansion
Star Wars Battlefront II (Old one)
Diablo, Destiny, tabletop simulator. We could try runningn a rpg one shot over google hangouts. 
I have both of those torrented and can share
Could mess around in Unturned on steam
Borderlands
Minecraft
Don't Starve Together
Tabletop Simulator
Civ? Can you do jack box remote?
Civ definitely works,  just a rather large time commitment unless there's asynchronous play
No idea about jackbox
Rocket Leage
Monster Hunter: World
Destiny
CoD
One of the newer Diablo games
Terraria
Speedrunners
Factorio
Terraforming Mars
CoD Zombies
League of Legends
Dota
Overwatch
pubg
Garry's Mod
DayZ
Portal 2
Titanfall
Palladins
Sea of Thieves
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UDDE5960N> <@UDC03KCGK> <@UDL020K8D> react to stuff to express interest
same goes for phoebe, but she already got pinged by all of these
Brenden did you see there's a battle arena cod comingout?
sounds weird
No I didn't see that
<https://www.callofduty.com/warzone>
Ohhhh I want to add Battle for Wesnoth
And over cooked
No
All the Overcooked!
And Unrailed
can unrailed be played online? or just local multiplayer?
My understanding is yes
Overcooked 2 i believe has online. Overcooked 1 is local only
I also own most of the games suggested above.
Now that Drew has a lot more time on his hands; this may take off a bit more
Might. I still a ton of stuff at home that I should do while I have the open time. Taxes, spring cleaning, stuff like that. I think it will take off more as we start into week 2
fair
I need to do my taxes as well
Yea.....
<@UETS9HTSS> I got TM app now. 
make an asmodee account
let me know your username
<@UDDE5960N> what's your account name on TM again?
lackmind
HelixPenguin
<@UETS9HTSS> did you start a TM game?
log into the online chat
I need to favorite you
i need to favorite you again on there
let me know next time you're logged in
I don't see you
<@UDDE5960N> vs <@UETS9HTSS> in TM thread:
@mention me when it's my turn
it's your turn btw
<@UDL020K8D> vs <@UETS9HTSS> in TM thread:
it's currently your turn
ping me when it's mine
Doesn’t the app ping you when it’s your turn?
I didn’t get a ping. That’s unfortunate 
yeah, but it's delayed, and it doesn't bring you right back into the game
<@UETS9HTSS>
it could use some work
<@UDDE5960N>
I don't see you doug!
<@UETS9HTSS>
Turn 
I was in the app as you said that. 
pass
found you

Turn. Is this really the easiest way to this? So manual. 
only because I'm hopping between two games

and cj is playing faster than you
Turn

anyone want to join me?
Ok, how does the TM draft work? I pick a card, leave the game, come back, and it’s offering me the same cards, so I have to make the same selection again. 
Did you actually select it?
Cause I don't have that issue
Yeah. 
Hmmmmm the app is kinda glitchy. Sometimes shutting it down all the way and restarting works for me
Just tried that. 
I’m clicking select on the card and then the keep button. 
Well I just did my turn with you see if that helps
Funny thing is I had to pick the card again, but then it moved to the next round. 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Turn 
<@UDDE5960N> what's your steam name? lackmind?
<https://s.team/p/nqd-ffvn/GBKRQMNG>
add me on steam
<@UDDE5960N>
I'm on borderlands again if you're free
Done
<@UETS9HTSS> join discord
Also level 12?~!?!?!
uhh
yeah
I was up until like 4am
Sounds like you're taking advantage of the extra free time well
yes sir!
up to level 19 with CJ; he's probably one or two lower
<@UDDE5960N> hopping on borderlands until 1pm
<@UETS9HTSS> dnd till later
I have D&amp;D at 1pm
so yeah
Turn. 
turn
<@UDDE5960N> borderlands discussion thread:
so I respecced my character yesterday
and now I feel like I'm playing quake or unreal tournament or something
lol
all my skills are kill based ones
when I kill someone I go super fast, do super damage, reload super fast, fire extra bullets, etc
like I deal percentage bonus damage based upon how fast I'm moving when the bullets/rockets hit
and it's significant
I found a shotgun that shoots what basically amounts to mortars
and so I fly around jumping, shooting mortars at things and making them explode
nearly done with the dlc handsome jack's casineo
jesus
Holy hell, what is this sorcery of a build? Sounds like it fucking sucks against a boss and is like a damned demon against hordes.
Nah, bosses have trouble hitting me
I just jump around the room, killing a minion every 15 seconds or so
since my mortars deal nearly 400 damage normally, and my (shoot extra projectileon the first 5 shots after I kill something) has a 105% chance of working, I'm doing ~800 * speed multiplier * crit multiplier if I have good aim
it's quite amusing
Glad you're having fun with it!
remember how I shoot an extra projectile :wink:
I like the mag size 8, ammo consumed 6
that might be from a passive bonus on my end
think that's just the gun, I didn't think bonuses got added to gun text
yep, you're right
just checked
Assuming Diablo 2 ends up working on my computer, would anyone be interested in joining me tonight? I’ve played 3 but never 2 before. 
I would, but I'm not home for a few days unfortunately
*hrrrkkkk *
This is very tempting
I really enjoyed playing Diablo II back in the day
I also never got into the expansion. I barely started it and then never bothered to finish it
yeah, I'll join
was a great game
How are you going about this Doug? Going to level up before playing with other people? Just want to know how much we should do prior to joining up tonight
I'm downloading the game now
I have only installed it. literally played 0 minutes
Don't know that I'll play at all before we start
what time are we thinking of starting?
idk, I'll probably stop working around 5. will have to eat eventually, but that might be later
Do you still have an extra copy?
I have torrented copies that I can probably share
With keys?
with a keygen
Makes sense.
though honestly, if you can't get that working and don't feel like buying it, I'd gladly chip in to just buy it for you
the more the merrier for online gaming
It's $10, it honestly shouldn't be a huge hardship. Just trying to save money right now is all
I also grabbed the expansion
as that's what I'm used to
I also picked up the expansion, which brought it to 20
Yeah I'm also used to the expansion honestly
I also got an error like "object does not have key:" or something like that when I downloaded the thing at first
Ok, so I can download the game. Before I spend the money though, would you all be open to starting at 7:30?
They are doing free opera streams from the archive every night starting at 7:30. So it is a good way for Sam to be preoccupied during her thing for 3 hours while I play this
is it bad if we start early and you come in later? or should we all start together?
we kind of need to start together
hard to catch up in d2
I can play borderlands until then
I can wait until 7:30
<@UDDE5960N> you in?
Cool, I'll spend the money then. Thank you guys!
beat borderlands then play diablo after work?
Nahhhh I never really got into D2
now's the time
I'm going to play a summon necro
I have enough trouble trying to keep up in border lands
:wink:
that's only because I have super speed
and can just fly by stuff
No that's because you put in way more time than I have
:innocent:
I don't have a pregnant woman in my house
And who knows how much more time I'll continue to have
Yes
:booooo:
How do you guys handle voice chat when you play?
I tend to use Discord
Been out of online gaming for a while now
<@UETS9HTSS> does that mean I should be keeping a character for this group and if I want to play extra to do that on a different character?
Discord
idk; I'll also have trouble not playing
I feel like so long as you're willing to go back and help the lowest level person do the main questline, it's okay to play ahead
That's less fun in my experience :disappointed:
Good to know
ok, I know if three you can kind of have the highest level person just rush through and the lower people will automatically level up
I likely won't be the lowest level person
Depends on the purpose in which you're playing
<@UDC03KCGK>, how much do you plan on playing?
we can have characters just for playing with drew
Whenever we plan on playing together
ok, one character to keep in-sync with group. sounds good
I'm stuck here another week. I have time if I use my time well
sounds good
Yeah the only thing I'm going to do before tonight is get the games installed, set up a character, and do the initial town stuff and dialogue before actually venturing on.
Do I need a headset for Discord, or was my computer mic fine the other day?
your mic was fine
at least I didn't notice a problem
do you have a super loud keyboard?
I have a keyboard that might be loud
because I do, so I need a headset to avoid annoying people
Wait..... when did you guys get drew on discord?
stocks
not on discord
????
Google Meet!
yes
Is there a separate discord that needs to be set up? Or just using the old DND one?
Up to you, there's one I use for everyhing
just created my character and talked to the people in the first town
ok, so I should talk to people in town first.
do we need to get a balance of classes? <@UDC03KCGK> <@UETS9HTSS> what did you pick?
currently thinking summon necromancer
willing to change if need be
maybe an assassin or sorcerer or something
I know a paladin would synergize very well with a necromancer because of the auras
I'm used to playing a Drewid so I'm thinking of playing something different this time around
What class do you want to play <@UDL020K8D>? You're the one who's never played so you should play what sounds fun to you, and I'll just pick based on need
I've haven't looked at the classes yet. I have a 3pm meeting, will do after
Cool, works for me.
Any thoughts on a new discord or a different one Brenden?
Sure, I can create a new one
<https://discord.gg/k3TJys>
Let me know when you've picked a class Doug, just cause the sooner I know the sooner I can pick one and get through the bs before I make dinner and all that
I'll pick Amazon
how much town stuff should I do before 7:30? Will it be obvious when to stop?
there's nothing to do
just talk to all the NPCs to get their welcome
and get the first quest
So looks like we need a tank
Can a pali do that sufficiently, or should I try barb?
Go glass cannon squad
i would be a sorceress if I thought that we didn't need a tank
DOOOO IT!
to be fair, I'll raise an army of tanks
eventually
Ugh, Drewid as a bear would be good too
But I want to try something different
in pvp build good comps, in pve build what you want drew
Ok, I did the town talk stuff. The controls are basically identical to D3. 
yeah, what changed wasn't really the gameplay, just the options/graphics/story
<@UDDE5960N> I'm bored; let's beat borderlands
Damn son don't you have work to do?
You creted the character on <http://Battle.net|Battle.net> yes?
Um, maybe not. 
Diablo 2 won’t connect to <http://battle.net|battle.net>. 
Should be a patch you have to install
Ah, a restart did it. 
I closed the game and reopened it and had to go through making a <http://battle.net|battle.net> account because this is the old <http://battle.net|battle.net>
They deleted accounts every 90 days????????
Should I check “ladder character” or not?
I checked ladder character. I'm not sure it matters
and yeah, they used to delete characters ever 90 days. Different time
So weird. 
Ok, I’m set up now. 
3 days and 19 hours to beat borderlands 3
this doesn't bode well for the upcoming weeks
I'm ready to go whenever
lol
If you like simulations rimworld is going to be my recommendation
317 hours
of play time
Rimworld is fantastic. As is factorio
created a game on us east
called chaos
password: monkey
description: corona-gaming
join the discord voice chat when you hop on
trying to connect to discord now
First time I playyed rimworld I accidently pulled an all nighter. Great game
Yea..... that's a game you can lose a lot of time on... and the come the mods
hop in
<@UDL020K8D>
Omw 
are we playing again this evening?
My BitD group is trying to meet remotely tonight
BitD?
Blades in the Dark
ahh
got it
well, maybe I'll level up my assassin
I'm a storm cultist
well my assassin is now ahead of us
so there's that
Not terribly surprised. I basically caused an hour and a half break
????
Should have listened to you: Paladins weren't how I wanted to play, so I switched out to a mage, but I was 7 levels back, so I had to go level up before we could continue. 
Then I found an early boss who wrecked me for half an hour straight
Ohhhhh
my necromancer now has a 37% chance of getting magic items from my kills
so apparently it's not a party stat
it only applies to the ones that I last-hit
I'm assuming you gave yourself some gear from the assassin?
Can you trade items between online and offline characters?
Or is your necromancer lvl 20 now?
yeah, traded gear from assassin to necro and gambled a bunch
no killing monsters on the necro
can't trade from offline to online
got really lucky
gambled my way into gloves that give +24% magic item chance
max is 25%
Fancy
scratch that, I'm at 50% now
got rare boots that give 21%
How do you trade? Logging in with both at once somehow? Or log in, dump loot, log out, log in with other character?
the latter
Surprised that works honestly
Server instance
<@UDC03KCGK> you down to play diablo after doug is done?
Yeah, just ping me or better yet text me.
I'm hopping on my necro now
<@UDC03KCGK> doug said he'd be on before 10pm
wrapping up now
I don't know how you guys can function so late.
So last night was a bit of an anomaly in terms of how long we were searching for random stuff. Brenden and I got the waypoints though before we logged off. Even though the map resets, we know what we are looking for when we next log on.
2 hours was about right though in terms of game time I can comfortably commit to every night.
ok, just to be fully clear, adding Unrailed does not mean that I don't also want to play Diablo as well. I am still in for Diablo-ing when there is time
Ohhhh unrailed!!!
To be honest, I'm a bit worried about adding on Unrailed just because I was originally going to wait for a steam sale. This whole out of work thing has me trying to be pretty diligent about not spending money
oh, that's fair. if you want us to play something different that's fine
Yea I only saw it on sale right after pax
This your assassin or Necromancer?
Also <@UDL020K8D> and <@UETS9HTSS> does that mean no Diablo tonight because of Doug's DnD? Or we doing another log on at 10pm thing?
that's my necro
and I can do 10pm again if you two are willing
I'm just playing on my alternate character instead while doug isn't around
partly through act 4
We’ll see. I can’t yet. 
Jeezus, are all those gems from playing with us or you transferring from your assassin?
transfer
just got a 50 poison damage over 5 seconds charm
I’m probably a no for tonight. 
Totally fine, thanks for letting us know on the earlier side of things
I may have beat normal mode with my assassin, then opened the secret cow level and farmed a bit in there
and I respec'd my necromancer
I now have curses
That'll be fun. Seems like playing your assassin has kept you occupied.
that it has, though I do prefer playing in a group
I'm reading the story to all the Diablo games. The thing I get hung up on is how he comes back in the 3rd one based on how the second one ends
Haha, Drew, the entire fanbase of Diablo hates the story in the 3rd game
I don't know that the entire fanbase hates the story. I've learned more and more that the internet can have a very vocal banded group of people...that fail to be representative
would people be interested in playing some speedrunners?
nah being cheap
Quick question: is it better to have 2 channels, one for online games like Diablo 2 and Unrailed, with this channel purely for board game nights?
Just thinking for post apocalypse life
Edited because I truly imagine the apocalypse being much worse than this situation, however bad it may be.
<@UETS9HTSS> you playing a game right now in Diablo II?
There's already a game going called "chaos"
am not
In dnd currently
Gotcha. Ok, well I made a new game instead then to level up a druid I'm playing through with
I may join you later
I mean, I'm going at it pretty slowly. It's level 6 and I'm trying to get a full detail of story and what not
that's fine, I'd have to catch up anyway
i prefer to keep it.
1)so everyone feels invited
2)when we switch back to board games this will get buried if we don't keep it up
not sure what I'd play though
Your buried comment suggest we should create a separate channel for online games
yea but it's only gain traction for lock down. it'll probably go away after
Yeaz I prefer to keep it in one channel as well
Drew does your sorc have a level in static field?
If so, we can take Diablo
Um? Not sure. I think that was a prereq for one of the spells I have.
Yeah it was a prereq for Nova which ends up giving bonuses to chain lightning. So I have a single point in it.
So guess I know how the next run at Diablo goes: Drew teleports next to Diablo. Static Field. Drew runs away like a scared chicken with another teleport.
Unfortunately can't rinse and repeat that more than twice I think
if you are playing over lunch, I'm in chaos, monkey
Still at baby doc.
you don't play diablo anyway
Anyone interested in some Unrailed?
Mebbe
yes
or speedrunners
Oh, you bought the game?
Yea, theres 4 of them you should get them to play with you
<@UETS9HTSS> BL3 things
Dude COV makes so much more sense on the 2nd play through
why?
I thought they made enough sense on the first playthrough
or do you mean knowing who their father is?
because the twins are literally born because of hunting vaults trapped on the vault home world, hence children of the vault
Bam double meaning
ahh, I see what you mean
if people are looking for other things to play, Mtg Arena is free-to-play. You can totally grind quests into a decent deck over time.
Also, the next two Fridays they are doing events where you don't need to own any cards:
&gt; March 27—Challenger Decks
&gt; Choose between the four preconstructed 2020 Challenger Decks and jump in to challenge others.
&gt; April 3—All Access
&gt; Build a deck with any cards in Standard, whether they're in your collection or not. Play others, build more decks, play again. Rinse. Repeat.
&gt; 
&gt; <https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena>
Anybody up for Unrailed tomorrow? We have at least 2
I can play; so 3
I really want to play speedrunners at some point though
how many does it max out at?
unrailed? or speedrunners?
4
unrailed
4
same as speedrunners
as I just found out
<@UHQD9J1SL> <@UDDE5960N> <@UETS9HTSS> You all in for Unrailed tonight? If so, would you be opposed to starting at around 7?
no time constraints on my end
(get the ghost car)
7 works  perfectky for me
oh but thats 5 people
I'm not available tonight.
if you get 5, Brenden should introduce you and Drew to LoL (free-to-play, 5 person team game)
maybe probably bl3 with a different friend
ugh- so- anyone has steam on their work laptop?
No..... generally work laptop's are a pain to download shit. Why?
just checking :smile:
my surface is a little uncomfortable to use
I'll have to look into those because I haven't heard of any of them
the top two are fairly big names
Hearing this is a game, and knowing what the game actually involves are two very different things
if we're not going to regroup and kill diablo and continue on, I could use another multiplayer game that people are interested in
I plan to regroup. Just waiting on Doug. I assume he's still working on his Paladin
<@UDL020K8D> how's the paladin going?
24. I’ll probably have time later tonight to push it. 
if you're 24, we can probably push diablo soon
My barb can probably solo it
plus I'll be tanking most of diablo's hits, minus the AOE
out of curiosity, what does the damage range for your hammers look like at this point?
<@UDDE5960N> you probably don't have time because baby, but there's a new borderlands 3 dlc to play through if you're interested
Yeah, I'd say push the Paladin to level 25 or 26 and we're good to go
Anyone have a chipped topaz (specifically chipped)
Need to upgrade 3 Thul runes into an Amn
I have mastered the baby holding game controller stance
So if there's a particular time let me know.  The only thing is feeding time trumps whatever we doing at the moment
I have a chipped topaz you can have
Currently making dinner
Afterwards if people aren't playing Diablo
:thumbsup:
Yaas
Let me know when you next hop on
Hopping on for 20 minutes
Confirmed overcooked 2 has online play, at least on the switch
currently thinking about starting on a minecraft binge
probably on an ATM3 or ATM5 server
anyone interested in joining me?
For anyone who isn’t familiar, Minecraft is a building game. You can fight some stuff, but there isn’t an objective. You mine and dig and build the cool stuff you want to. 
There is now? Kill the ender dragon!
That is a thing you can do. I wouldn’t call it an objective though. 
Well, not one the game sets. 
You can make your own objectives. 
The modded minecraft confuses me personally
I mean, you don't have to use most of the mods
You can play it like vanilla, there will just be additional items/mobs around the world
and likely new biomes to explore
I suppose I could binge some Minecraft.
I'll let you all know when I find a stable enough server
We could look for a pack with a quest book
currently setting up my installation through twitch now
SF4, PO3 have extensive quest lines
What's the draw of having the quest book?
Gives you things to work towards
instead of making up what you want to do, it gives you a method of progressing through mods
That's not really a draw for me
I like kitchen sink packs
:allthethings:
Take a look at Project Ozone 3. It has a massive number of mods, and a quest book that you don't have to follow
Also  3 levels of difficulty with modified recipes. Hardest mode has a TON of inter-mod crafting recipes, easiest mode has all vanilla mod recipes.
biggest pet peeve on that one is no thaumcraft
has most of the other big names I look for thogh
One thing I do miss is technomancy
but I don't think they've updated that mod in a long while
Don't think I have ever heard of that one
crossover of ae2 and thaumcraft
plus some other stuff
including the node fabricator
which let you manufacture thaumcraft nodes using liquified essense
Ah I definitely played a pack with that in it at one point. No idea what pack though. Maybe one of direwolf's
for me, it was the 1.7.10 pack
Currently leaning towards ATM3R
taking forever to boot up though
I could certainly be convinced to do project ozone if that's the only pack that others will play though
With no clear goals, modded is overwhelming. I'm fine with a kitchen sink pack, but people new to modded will benefit greatly from project ozone 3
Is <@UDDE5960N> willing to play?
I guess my question is who will join us
I at least understand that.
Burn it all to the ground!!!
cj in modded minecraft, there tend to be nuclear reactor mods
where you can make giant explosions if you do stuff "wrong"
Yea, minecraft is a large enough investment in time. Mods just make it larger
So I actually can't have fun in vanilla Minecraft at this point (at least, not for more than like a day)
Lol go for modded then
Minecraft doesn't grab me. Feels like digital Legos. Which Legos were fun, but the only times I've really played with them as an adult have been to build a specific thing, usually whatever the set itself is having you make.
which is why I suggest a quest book. It adds an element of progression towards a goal, instead of: Hey just go build cool things
Yeah, which I think would be helpful.
I'd be open to ozone 3
project ozone 3 version 3.2.54
`<http://o3.g.akliz.net|o3.g.akliz.net>`
oh nice titan mode
Titan mode?
They modify some recipes to require blocks from multiple mods, to give a sense of required progression to the strongest items in the game
like, you may have to get through most of the Astral Sorcery, Blood Magic, and Pneumaticraft mods to be able to build that quarry instead of getting it right away
Uhhhh ok?
OP blocks too easy to make. Titan makes them harder to get. See big ass quest book for how to get started
Click Open Folder
Find Config
find packmode.cfg, replace it
it's kind of a skyblock world
you start with pretty much nothing
Hmmm miner dimension locked behind astral sorcery.
This is the "Alpha" quest line, which walks you through how to get every block you see, and in what order you should get them
<@UDDE5960N>
lots of quest lines
Ok, that's better, still a pretty big time commitment
oh for sure. You can team up with people though as well.
wait <@UETS9HTSS> what commands were on that sign I didn't read when I stepped on the pressure plate
`/sethome` I think
<@UDC4QL95G> tpa me
if you want to do this together
You want a base partner or solo
i'm down for either
<@UDDE5960N> come play minecraft with us
how?
<@UDC4QL95G> minecraft thread
made a spectre energy injector
and the associated charger
What's that do?
charges items in your inventory remotely
it's on top of the magma generator
Oh nice. Infinite bow + sword now?
yep
also looted some magical crops
looted magical crops?
like the kind that grow metal?
yes
from where?
found the tablet that tps you to another players base
even though it was protected, jumping on crops make them drop
lmfao. I hope they had spares. were they bread up to 10/10/10?
some were, yes
note for our base, have layer of blocks 2 squares above our crops so you can't jump to make them drop
extend that block layer one square beyond the farm boundary
Hmmm if you jump in a 2 block high space, does that actually prevent the crops from breaking?
yes
cuz you can totally get a tiny bit of height jumping
need 3 blocks of height to break crops
believe me, I tried my hardest
:lol:
almost had electrical steel crops
Damn. I'll be sure to hop on the server after work
I think we have all wee need from lordcraft to move on to Blood magic
with those karats, blood magic will be super easy
sacrificial knife
For sure.
Who are you fighting?
mobs/bosses/other players
found a single use item that teleports me to another player's base
Yeah it allowed us to skip past some mods that we would have had to complete otherwise to get to some items we want
hopping on now
jeeze; boot up is slow today
still waiting for it to finish
Turns out I have owned Unrailed since January :lol:
Unredeemed humble monthly games :lol:
So playing Unrailed tonight yeah?
<@UHQD9J1SL> <@UDDE5960N> <@UDL020K8D> <@UETS9HTSS>
We must get back to the fire biome and see what is beyond!
Not tonight :(
i want to defeat the Lava monsters too!
I have something today. totally cool to play without me. I'll get back in another day.
It's up to you <@UETS9HTSS> and <@UDDE5960N> to make a group of 4
Although, CJ and I got a decent ways just as two players
I can play
Was already factoring you in based on the original comment about your unredeemed humble bundle
I'm free to play unrailed, but probably won't want to play more than a round or two
working down the armor quest line
tedious as fuck
Yeah, we haven't set up a quarry or anything for infinite resources, so I imagine it would be a bit of a bitch.
I made such a mistake
I forgot to collect on a quest before crafting the armor into the next one
:anguished:
Oh god. You could always set up AE2 auto crafting
we have 320 channels to work with
Good enough for me. We made good progress with 3
check out the recipe for solar panel of infinity
maybe depends on what the baby's schedule is and when you guys kick off
Can you post a picture of it?
Well... at least you get 3 of them. i'm guessing those sub solar panels are not cheap, nor are the bright white ones?
nothing in that recipe is cheap
ThAre those white orbs like... more expensive red matter?
orange matter
lol. How many steps from red to white?
10
Looking to kick off around 7 or sometime after that
lol that's 59k red matter
I'm starting dinner now, so I'll be ready to go around 7:30-8
starting dinner now
Ready to go
Automated the farm using Botania mana spreaders
We now have stupid amounts of Inferium
<@UDDE5960N> (or anyone else) you ever play an mmo or have any interest in playing guild wars? Ive been asking everyone, but nobody wants to play it with me haha. I play it every few years for like, 10-20 hrs with someone and that's about all

MMOs don't seem worth it for only 20 hours of play
MMOs don't seem worth it for only 20 hours of play
Also, we've been playing Civ VI if you're interested
A looot of Civ VI
Guild wars 1 or 2?
Also, way more than 20 hours in Civ 6
Guild Wars 2 - it's free to play, so I just play for a little bit with someone till they get bored. It's fun to just play around in for a while. 

Are you playing async or real-time civ 6?
We switch off. So when we can get together we convert one of the games we have to real time. Otherwise they remain in async during the week for when people take breaks.
Did not know Guildwars 2 was Free to play, I wonder how they make money?
Cause it's weird. 

The game doesn't really have vertical progression, so it's almost entirely cosmetic progression based. But the best cosmetics are sold in the cash shop, so end game is a bit weird. But I never get far enough to care about that. 

And they also make money from the expansions (tho not nearly as much)
Also, has anyone ever tried Offworld Trading Company? It's a fun little rts where you're not fighting with troops, but rather economics
yes
I enjoy it
I wouldn't mind playing against a real person
I'm kinda awful at it, but think it'd be fun to play

Hey friends, hope everyone is well! Just wanted to let folks know that some friends and I play mafia over zoom on Saturdays, if anyone is interested let me know! since i'm notoriously bad at checking slack feel free to shoot me a text if interested <tel:8605934997|860-593-4997>
Ben! We're playing avalon at 1 PM tomorrow- interested?

Time is more important than day for me
Not sure how to create a poll with every day and option without just making a doodle. What times work best for you in general?
Before 8 on weekdays
Then just fill in all weekdays and we'll plan to start by 6
<@UTFFJEJ6P> see this poll in case it doesn't end up being a Sunday we plan the next one for

Oh nice, I didn't know you were interested in playing Dave since you weren't in the first thread
Ok, so Avalon over video call is a success. The web call was stable, and the interface of the website <https://avalon.fun/login> works smoothly. There's a couple things that aren't explained and getting used to the way the interface works, but once you settle into that it works really well.
Things to know:
1. Once you pick a vote option you cannot switch it
Benefits:
1. You never ever have to remember anything about the night phase. If you're merlin, you can always go back and know for sure who the revealed bads are. If you're bad, you always can go back to check who is revealed bad with you.
thanks Drew for always keeping me in the loop! Appreciate it!
Alright, looks like Saturday and Sunday work best for people as a whole. Are there any time restrictions to be aware of? Such as I know CJ prefers everything is said and done by 8pm
Sunday is before 8pm, preference for not 1pm-3pm. Other than that I don't care about timing
On Saturday or Sunday I’d want to be done by 7. 
i just need to know ahead of time
Sunday I have something 5-7. otherwise flexible!
How does Saturday 3-5 work for people?
(except saturday 2-5)
<@UDDE5960N> does that no 1-3 thing apply to just Sunday or Saturday as well?
Sunday, that's usually when my DnD group is
They're bad at organizing under the new DM
how does this Saturday 12-2 sound to people?
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UDBGH9BMX> <@UTX6E7LLU> <@UHQD9J1SL> <@UDDE5960N> <@UTFFJEJ6P>
Looks like Saturday 12-2pm works for just about everyone. <@UTX6E7LLU> does it work for you?
Cool, Saturday 12-2 it is!
I’m stuck in a grocery line trying to make it back before 12 but maybe a bit late :( please start without me and I can join!

That Avalon session went well, and allowed us to see the full range of roles. Frankly playing Avalon via webchat is the most "human" web calls I have had the entire quarantine. Although without the Corin stares trying to make determinations of if you're lying or not.

Also if people wanted to play Secret Hitler instead next time, this site looks reputable <https://private.secrethitler.io/>
This one also seems like it might do the trick, but would need more people to test it out <https://secret-voldemort.de/>
Fancy! I'm in for any option!
aah! I keep missing the avalons!
aah! I keep missing the avalons!
We should try again next weekend. 
I agree.
I agree.
can also do weekday lunch hours?
We should continue until covid is gone!
Maybe my weeks are psychotic right now
<!here> Please fill out the poll again, as it gives us a sense on if people's schedules shifted from last week at all
It also doubles as a sign up in that way
Going off what aysh suggested above, are the weekday option on the poll for lunchtime or after work?
It's either or for me. I'm very much of the "Can you do that day at all?" and we'll figure time out later

Unless we do both. 
Saturday Avalon Thread
Need any time restrictions from people. For example I am not free from 8pm onward.
<@UTX6E7LLU> <@UDDE5960N> <@UTFFJEJ6P> <@UDBGH9BMX> <@UDTR9SLN4> <@UDL020K8D>

Saturday's are flexible
<@UHQD9J1SL>
Sorry Phoebe, not sure why I assumed you filled out the poll
I was thinking I might make some curried roasted carrots for lunch
Lol I’m always happy to be included
So what was the issue with 1-3pm you mentioned before CJ?
Just going to sign onto the video call and eat in front of us?
Nah, just chiming in on this lunch thread :wink:
sorry friends I didn't realize I have a project due this week (i'm taking an online class and project two is due this Sunday, I'm prob out this week)
That's ok Caroline, shouldn't be a problem. Good luck with the project!
So Phoebe, were you planning to join? If so, does Saturday or Sunday work better? Because otherwise Sunday is on the table for this group if that would work better
I'm generally free unless other things come up with family last minute, so I should be good
I have meetings on either side, so 12-1 is what works for me

If it needs to be later, other days of the week work as well
Either is alright Saturday might be a little better but not significantly
Ok, so would anyone have a preference over Saturday at 12-2 again?
Unfortunately if you want to do a lunch one this week, no other day works because Caroline can't do this week afterall, and you have indicated you cannot do Friday
<@UDBGH9BMX> <@UDTR9SLN4> <@UDL020K8D> are you free Thursday at noon?
:sure:
Are you willing to play twice in a week?
Haha, I'm not doing much else :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
so- IM off on friday, wanted to sleep :stuck_out_tongue: but i can still play avalon if it really does work for everyone else
Thursday noon works for me. 
Well, Marla said she is free any day this week for a lunch game other than Friday, so for now I'm going to assume Thursday at 12pm works for everyone involved. <@UDTR9SLN4> please tell us if 2 games in a week or Thursday at 12pm does not work for you

I’ll put Thursday in my calendar. Is there another day I should put in my calendar too?
Saturday at noon
I’m going to look at an apartment in Newton this morning. I expect to be home before Avalunch, but you should start without me if I’m late

also, what did we decide we do for video chats?
we've been using a wayfair hangout and just accepting the non-wayfairians
:+1:
Also you should request a slight intro into the web tool, it's good and once you know what's going on intuitive, but there's no tutorial
There's only 5 of us, so we can't actually start without you, but the intent is there :slightly_smiling_face:
Meet us now available for free on all google accounts. We could do it without the Wayfair one be if everyone had gmail.

Thoughts on Board Game Arena vs Tabletop Simulator?
Having never used either before today
Tabletop Simulator requires us all putting in money
and I don’t want to install steam on my work computer
It requires Steam?
<https://www.humblebundle.com/games/asmodee-play-with-friends>
<!here>
y'all should pay $12 to get all these
Yeah, that's tempting
looks like its 2-3 hours normally. Maybe its faster in digital
I’ve been meaning to play Twilight Struggle. I’ve heard its really good.
Patchwork is great. 2 player game but more like 30 minutes
I’ve wanted to play Twilight Struggle for a while. but I think its a 12 hour 2-player game, which is a bit much
I actually own that game, not that I've ever played physical
There's a very good app for twilight struggle.
I tried playing twilight struggle once for two hours and didn’t even make it past the rules
The app actually has a great tutorial - I got most of it (enough to beat the computer at least) on my first play
oof
Small World 2 and Twilight Stuggle
I think I have an extra code or two that were duplicates if anyone isn't going to buy the bundle
If I buy the humble bundle, are those codes all for Steam? Of are there different platforms those codes are good for?
I believe they're all for steam?

Not really anything to push on. I didn't do a poll, but I figured more people would react and upvote it. Can't play a hidden roles game with 3.
too true
anything you want to play?
I'm curious who else got the humble bundle. I spent the $12 on it, would like to start seeing some use out of it
But there's always Civ otherwise.

Good luck! Cuddling with ash for bed time
You all from Wayfair have Thursday and Friday off this week, correct?
Yeah. 
<!here> There are two polls. 1 for *hidden roles* games, *and* 1 for *humble bundle* virtual board games
I can play Avalon on the weekends, but only the evenings
That's fine. Short of making doodles, there's no way for me to include times in polls without giving way too many options. I'd say mark as available if you are available at any point in the day, not just if you are free the entire day. Then just indicate with a message like you said about times
But if you don't mark it without a vote, I cannot guarantee I'm going to remember "Saturday has 2 + Marla if we do it at night"

I don't have the impression more than the 4 of us even bought this
Was thinking Sycthe, would try other games like Smallworld 2
Quite interested in scythe
Don't care
I got it
Scythe could be good. Plays up to 5 people. 
Scythe is good with at least 4, so I would think let's do that on Thursday. That works for all 5 of us
Anyone have any time restrictions or preferences?
nope
<@UHQD9J1SL> you said you're free Friday for Avalon, but not for Scythe. Just seems to prudent to split these up between Thursday and Friday if possible
<@UHQD9J1SL> you said you're free Friday for Avalon, but not for Scythe. Just seems to prudent to split these up between Thursday and Friday if possible
In which I would recommend we play Scythe on Friday
corrected myself, free both days for a game :slightly_smiling_face:
Techincally working, but I'll just have to be unavailable then!
I thought you had those days off?
<@UDDE5960N> so you are not going to/able to take those 2 free days?
i will likely make the time
i'm expecting the next 2 days to be light duty
I'm just confused because I thought everyone in OpEx was encouraged to take the time off for free
some opex functions are needed for the sales floor. my team is ine if them
Boo
And since I'm out next week with Ash, I got Thursday Friday.  It's not a big deal should be a super quiet day going into my leave
And since I'm out next week with Ash, I got Thursday Friday.  It's not a big deal should be a super quiet day going into my leave
so I should be able to make whatever time we want to do games
Ok, so Friday at 4pm then sound good to everyone?
Hidden Roles Thread :thread:
This is for Scythe?
Or for something else?
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDTR9SLN4> <@UDL020K8D> <@UTZJEALPP> <@UHQD9J1SL>
Looks like tomorrow would be best. Any time restrictions or preferences?
Also <@UTX6E7LLU> <@UTFFJEJ6P> not sure if you both saw the poll, but if you're around tomorrow with the day off, please feel free to join us!
Scythe
I’m actually heading up to Maine tomorrow so I probably won’t be able to make it
works for me
I'll note that I've never played
you should really watch a video. or maybe the game itself has a tutorial. I haven’t installed it yet.
Yeah, I'll see what I can do before Friday at 4
My schedule is pretty booked though, I'm not sure I'll have time
we’ll figure something out.
that was sarcasm in case that was missed
no 10-11 or 4-5
for now
4 is a bad start time for, i now have daily updates aboout a project thats not even mine
Help us out then on when better start times are for you.
Help us out then on when better start times are for you.
Say 11?
Or you'd have to wait while I take a 4:30 call, god I hate this comp project
I can do 11am. Figured that would be the middle of your work day, but if you can swing it, great
<@UETS9HTSS> <@UDL020K8D> <@UHQD9J1SL> any concerns on 11am?
Works for me. 
:thumbsup:
It's more I have a meeting at 4:30 with my boss, easier to swing something when no one is watching
Schrodingers Swing?
How long do we think this will be?
2-3 hours
Blocked off
I'd love to join! (will be looking at apartments cause I'm moving at different times throughout Thursday and Friday) so I will join if I'm free during the time decided
Well it is going to be tomorrow, not between 10-11 or 4-5...so is there a time that works best for you with the moving?
oh whoops English is too hard--I'm waiting for current tenants to get back to me on times I can go look at potential apartments. :disappointed:
I can do mostly any time, early afternoon works best for me
A Lunch date has appeared on my calendar, so I’m busy from 11:30 to 1. I also have zoom babysitting from 4:30 to 6
Ok, 2-4 it is!
Lol I need to practice apparently

Did you buy the expansion?
Or was the expansion supposed to be part of the humble bundle?
No and no
How did he play a 5th bot then?
I see 4 bots and a human. 
Nevermind, I'm dumb
yes
I'm free whenever
I'm free whenever
I’m stepping through the tutorial to see the controls right now. 
I'm really going to struggle with knowing what the other faction powers are, and the interface doesn't seem to show me how to know those easily

My bad
Can someone set up the Google Meet?
Turns out anyone with gmail can do it now, you don’t need Wayfair. 
<https://meet.google.com/vaj-vzns-ywk>
I got dragged into an impromptu meeting
:party_rip:
I should be good because
it's not visual
I mean it is giving me time to finish up the tutorial
I’m all set. Whenever we’re ready. 
I logged in
waiting on drew
lackmind is the user
I don't see Doug on
Anyone want to play tonight?

No, but i'll try it
I’ll install it now.

Scythe happening?
I can play, but not until after D&amp;D
which started like 30 minutes ago
Ohhhhh
What time is that? I thought Drew said 1pm today. 
I didn't see that; I said sure before he suggested a time
Well that's awkward
:awkwardturtle:
When will Dnd be over?
Yeah I'm not going to have time to wait up for DnD. I didn't have any indication there were time constraints other than CJ
So I can do 3 player Scythe now, or you can do 3 player Scythe when Brenden is done
let's play now then.
Alright now it is, and a 2nd game later!
give me 2 minutes and I'll be there
discord or meet?
I like having video, but it doesn't really matter
I won’t use the video since I’m at the computer without a camera. 
Let’s just hop on discord. 
<@UETS9HTSS> do you still wanna play scythe/ is :dnd: over?
<@UETS9HTSS> do you still wanna play scythe/ is :dnd: over?
just ending now
I could do this, or I could play cod (a friend texted me to play)
what do people want to do?
I’m out for a walk right now. In a graveyard right now, oddly. 
Play without me. 
I could play a game. Sam's on a phone call.
Don't care, could go for either Scythe, CoD or Civ
same
<@UDC03KCGK> preference?
CoD or Civ is better for a drop in drop out kind of thing.
cod is best from drop out
civ is fine, but we'll all need to drop when you do
Booting up CoD
<@UDC03KCGK> you joining?
I'm updating
Which apparently will take forever
Could just say screw it and go Scythe
<@UDL020K8D> almost back from your walk by chance?
No, I’ll be out a while. 
Anyone up for a game today?

This guy right here!
Rain cancels outside activities!
Oh, I honestly figured you had to clean the camp still!
Finally get that 4 player game of Scythe at 1? <@UETS9HTSS> <@UDL020K8D> ?
I have a family video call at noon
But that should work
I have some stuff to do today. You can ask Aysh for a fourth. 
Ok, good luck with your productivity. <@UHQD9J1SL> want to try Scythe finally?
Works for me
Let's say 1:15 so Sam has some time to get some Hollow Knight in
