same deal as yesterday; any interest in converting at some point today?
I have meetings till 2:30 so any time after that
Unfortunately not today. Don't want this game getting in the way of me getting stuff done. Sticking to async for at least the next day or so.
we ever going to go live on this game again?
My rules are before 9pm on a school night, or any time where you give me a heads up.
so this is the game tonight?
so this is the game tonight?
Seems like it
So what time are we going live
So what time are we going live
depends on drew
<@UDC03KCGK>
I'm guessing 7:30
I thought that was his end time?
not the start
oh, my mistake
nvm, you're right
It's his start/end depending on if he's doing dinner I think
<!channel> where are you? I'm in discord
anyone interested in going live at some point
Sorry Brenden, missed your message. Not today but another day this week before CJ's old man bedtime
Yea back on night duty again :(
Can you do like 4pm-6pm any day?
Can you do like 4pm-6pm any day?
When is night duty from when to when for you CJ?
Depends on how the day is going, it'll be a game time decision. Night duty means taking care of Ashley overnight with lots of interrupted sleep. So like 7-8 bed time
Ok, when you're free, I can probably make myself free
ask me when that is
ask me when that is
game time decision for me as well
<@UETS9HTSS> it is your turn
I have meetings till 5 tomorrow right now and that's it
I have some free time tonight, like an hour or so
I don't know what the rest of the week will bring
well these turns are short
so an hour should do us some good
<@UDC03KCGK> we would need to start soon
<@UDC03KCGK> how about it?
The ping helped, was on the phone. I'd say wait till tomorrow though, still doing a few things here
kk
are we live tonight?
If so I can do an hour. <@UETS9HTSS>?
(pings get my attention better btw <@UDDE5960N>)
:stuck_out_tongue:
when?
now?
No at 6
At 6?
I meant I can do till 6
Ohhhhh
LETS GO!
<@UETS9HTSS> NOW!
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UETS9HTSS> Invites sent
You jumped off of discord?
If we want to go live with any games, the best times are honestly 4pm - 6pm
or earlier, but I fell that is pushing it for you both with jobs
I have a 3-4pm meeting (refinement)
I have a 4-4:30 1 on 1
That's fine, I just want to put it out there as a general axiom. Sam wants an hour after work to do her own stuff, so I basically have 5-6pm free
So, yeah, 4-6pm is when I'm the most free on a daily basis that also lines up with your guy's 9-5s
every day.
But that also means by the time 6pm rolls around, she's ready to hang out or make dinner or something, and I'm trying to be in bed by 9:30 most days
Otherwise it has to be this planned out thing like we do for the Civ game with Phoebe
4:30pm game?
uhhhh i can probably do something if you want
<@UETS9HTSS> you need to disable mods
You baddie
<@UETS9HTSS> PAY ATTENTION TO ME!
oh
Why are you not on Discord?
Change the sound output in Discord
Gets messed up a lot for me
half production
ranged +
<@UDDE5960N>
Huh?
world congress bs
You're teaming up against me?!
?
that was public info, was it not?
...you're right
but why did you ping CJ?
he's next in the turn order
Fair
I'm ok with those
<@UDC03KCGK>
Not tonight guys. If we make plans a day ahead of time, I can make sure to be free. Say Monday or Tuesday?

I was more just pinging you to take your turn
but planning to go live works too
Maybe
Maybe
fucking world congress
lol
Fucking world congress. A whole turn to let me know it was convened and that I could not be party to it or vote in any way.
Woot...
<@UETS9HTSS> Both drew and I were thinking of playing and I see you on. Thoughts?
sure
on a family call though
so I won't be in voice for awhile
ok, I'll load that game and invite everyone
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UETS9HTSS>, I wasn't going to bring up the new DLCs, but I just saw "Secret Societies Game Mode" and got really excited
what's the draw of it?
Dunno, it just reminds me of Avalon, which then reminds you don't like avalon
So now I'm bummed
:this_is_fine_lit:
bump
<!here>
Ok, so you want to plan for tomorrow then?
sure
sure
ok
What time? Ideal for me is 4pm but you guys, you know, have jobs.
Have to check my calendar tomorrow, but probably 5-6
Have to check my calendar tomorrow, but probably 5-6
<!here> done with my day whenever you fools are ready
I can hop on civ


:hypereyes:
Look I took a day off
Also, for the record, Brenden constantly asking about science output is what put me into enough anxiety to go heavy on science
Also, for the record, Brenden constantly asking about science output is what put me into enough anxiety to go heavy on science
so I found some additional mods I want to pass by you two: :start_a_thread:
capture unique improvements: when you capture a city that has civ unique improvements, they aren't destroyed
city roads: when your worker builds an improvment, it also builds a road on that tile
Environment Skin: Civilization V Theme + Diversified Vegetation - makes forest/jungle look very different by biome
Faster Starting Settlers: gives your starting settler more movement so if you do want to move a tile or two away, you don't lose out on as much
PerfectWorld6: map generation
Watchtower Improvement: scout line of units can build an improvment that increases the sight radius of an occupying unit by 2, +1 sight for units in adjacent encampments and defensive improvements
Strategic Forts: makes a unit that claims territory without placing a city (each one after the first is significantly more expensive; ai won't use this)
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UDDE5960N>
I like Strategic Forts, and ok with Faster Starting settler and perfect world. Watchtower seems neat, but I almost always have a better use for the land just like forts
I'm fine with what CJ is fine with
CJ I think you can build watchtowers outside your territory?
Definitely better, I'd be fine with it. I just don't know if I would ever find a use for it. Maybe to keep bandits from spawning?

Watchtowers seem fun.
Yea, I was just thinking through the use of having a unit be stuck in 1 spot with +visions and I was really struggling to find a use
For me it is massing units for a war just out of eyesight
I'd also use them for extended eyesight for stationed units as early warning systems
do we want to start a modded 3 player game?
Not yet. I need some of these other games to finish first.
Once we do create the new game, this is my proposed mod list:
&gt; Better Espionage Screen (adds filters, side screens, etc.)
&gt; Better Loading Screen (more complete info on civ specific units/buildings/etc.)
&gt; Better Report Screen (policy, city state impact, units, deals, and other report screens)
&gt; Better Trade Screen (let's you sort trade routes by various metrics in asc/desc order)
&gt; Capture Unique Improvements (when capturing a city, doesn't destroy civ unique improvements)
&gt; City Roads (builder improvements also build roads)
&gt; Diversified Vegetation (for Civ V Skin) (forest/jungle looks different in different biomes)
&gt; Environment Skin: Sid Meier's Civilization (required for diversified vegetation)
&gt; Extended Diplomacy Ribbon (gathers relevant diplomacy info from many views into one)
&gt; Faster Starting Settlers (starting settler has +1 movement)
&gt; Gold Resource (in the game as a part of a scenario, puts in normal games)
&gt; Good Goody Huts (more tribal villages)
&gt; More Lenses (builder lense, archaeologist lense, city overlap lense, etc.)
&gt; PerfectWorld6 (interesting world generation that's intended to be more realistic)
&gt; Quick Start (no loading screen when booting up civ)
&gt; R.E.D. Modpack (units are smaller in the tile, and there are more of them in formation)
&gt; Removable Districts (adds city projects to remove districts from the map)
&gt; Strategic Forts (adds unit that let's you capture territory outside of city borders)
&gt; Vibrant Waters (visual change)
&gt; Watchtower Improvement (increases sight range of occupying unit, and units in adjacent defensive structures)

I would also consider adding CIVITAS (city state), but I don't think CJ liked that as it makes the city states start with walls
I also just haven't reached the point of needing the additional city states.

Do you understand what it adds?
It adds _types_ of city states, and 10 envoy bonus on top of the 1/3/6
Yes, I understand it. Still don't like it
Cool :thumbsup:
I like all the ones you proposed. 
The faster movement for staying settler: that's very first one ever, or the first one you construct from your capital?
Turn 1
I'm against the Roads one, I think it adds something neat that I just can't road spam in this game.  Is there a reason you left the better harbor one out? I feel like the unique districts could be broken but I'll roll with that one
it doesn't apply to districts, just tile improvements
so like the nubian pyramid or sphynx
40AQL
40AQL
whoops
I cycled turns beforesaving
<@UDDE5960N>
I'll go save
Ugh, gonna be a fun double turn
LOL!
It took me way too long to realize you got botted
if I get in the habit of not capitalizing my first word in sentences, I can fuck with people's heads more
...
CJ
pay attention to me
What?
send an invite
the world congress auto ended my turn
because I'm not involved
oh
invite sent
Forgot about the mods
I tried to warn you
LOL!
take 2
<@UDDE5960N> ready up
