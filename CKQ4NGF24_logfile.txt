Well, sounds like a night at Earl's Cocktail labs
Name the date (not this weekend or MLK Jr weekend)
December 30th
Copenhagen was great. I'd go back for booze.
Japan food thread <@UDDE5960N> <@UDL020K8D> <@UK7V13DS7>
Every food in Japan was amazing. I had everything I could and they were all so different and fantastic
ONLY food that dissapointed me in Japan was McDonalds
I’ve made a point to not go to American chains in other countries. 
Well I wanted to go there cause I heard that McDonalds has crazy menus abroad
I never go to fast food here
Mei makes a point to try all of the local McDonald's
Actually, I take that back, ive eaten at 7-eleven in Japan and Denmark. 
7/11 food is amazing
Yeah, it was surprising. 
Cup o sake, rice balls
Yea, 7/11 is amazing. The Onigiri are fantastic
Had several of em if I was ever hungry. So cheap and so delicious
Yup. Was useful when I didn’t feel l Ike figuring out what to do for lunch. Rice ball for the win. 
We did them for breakfast usually
And it was bloody delicious
The food courts were CRAZY!!!
Yeah, the quality of food from places I’d expect shitty food here was amazing. 
Pretty much no shitty food
We just wandered around, dazed cause we just got off the flight, went into some random place and got some random thing from a vending machine. $5 and fantastic
I got sushi wrapped in persimmon leaves from a little shop in a train station. 
America: never buy sushi in train stations even if it looks super clean

Japan: Just take whatever raw food they offer
Pretty much!
Which was the most awful thing I've ever tasted
I quickly found a milk tea I liked and bought it from every vending machine I could find. 
I think I actually got the same one. It was really good actually!
7/11 sake is amazing, I never bought anything else
I'm sure the sake is great. But this was like, $2 and I *had* to try it
$2 20% is never going to taste good. That's like pure ethanol
Yupppppp
I really wanted to try it tho
It was $1.4ish for 220 ml
I only had sake from restaurants at dinner. Good to a 7/11 to buy booze to drink alone in the street seemed too degenerate. 
haha, it'd be the true salaryman experience though
True. 
I did use a beer vending machine at the airport though. 
I never used one of those cause I didn't know what it'd do with a US ID
This one I don’t think I used I’d. Just hit a button saying I was of age.
oh, wow
Us passport knows everything
Man, looking through all these pictures makes me really want to go back to Japan...
I want to try Korea and a couple other places before I let myself double up on vacation locations. 
Yea, agreed. Tho Japan is really enticing...
Though it probably won't be as cool the 2nd time around cause I already did most of the things I had always wanted
Go to Denmark if you haven’t. If Danish wasn’t a crazy hard language I’d be trying to figure out how to live there. 
Ehhhhh I'm lazy I travel where the munchkin tells me
I've been to Sweden twice because of reasons, so that's close enough
never been there
I saw Sweden across the sea from Elsinore, but haven’t been yet. 
Sweden was... good?
It was pretty much a generic European city with okay, but a bit bland food
Nice place, but nothing special about it
Copenhagen (København) was great. It really obvious just hanging out that it is the happiest country on Earth. And these great open faced fish sandwiches. I had a tasting menu of sandwiches at one place!!
Was so good, especially considering how simple it all looked. 
Sounds like Sweden. not bad food, just pretty simple
You can say the same of Japan. Rice, fish, noodles. Just done very well. 
I spose. But I liked Japanese food much more
I try every 7/11 in Asia not McDonald unless they have something specia
I love Japan and Korea! Actually all of asia hehehe 
We are going back to japan soon. Are you still in japan?
I went to Japan for 2 weeks 1.5 yrs ago. Wish I could/would go again, but don't think that's happening anytime soon
I want to go back to Thailand, food is so good 
<@UDC03KCGK> what is the name of the place you work?
Time out market
Where in time out market? Aren’t there multiple things there?
I’m there for lunch with work people. That’s why I thought of it. 
He works at one of the two bars
depends on the day
Isn’t that in Fenway? Far for lunch
eh, took a long lunch. Helps when the manager is with you.
#2.5 hour lunches are great
get in an hr late. Take a 2 hr lunch. Then ya gotta leave at 4, cause it's a Friday
Thanks Brenden for answering. The last 5 days straight I would have been there at that time. Today I'm working night shift for once
Wait this sounds like a good thing.  You're finally getting shifts?
Yeah, I'm getting work. Too late though as I had to sign up for state health care
:harold:
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought MA health care was one of the better ones?
it is
You still gotta pay for it, rather than the company though
tru
Om nom nom!
#tearandshare
yum!
I want some!!!
What is it
It is a tear away loaf (British baking show inspired) it is filled with tomato sauce, cheese, and salami. Easy to make but takes a long time for proofing
I am bringing a small amount on Wednesday so you can fight people for it
We can't eat it so I will restrain Mei
Lactose monster yeah :(
<@UK7V13DS7> You like food. What is the best food you've ever eaten?
That is a quality gif
That is a loaded question.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Is it?
Because she's going to give you a list by food type and ethnicity
oh, that's okay
Too much work but I would had done that hahaha
I would had done it by country too lol 
But now I get nothing? :sadpotato:
I really enjoy Ramen
Does that help dave?
Oh, me too. I was just interested, cause I know that Mei is a foodie and likes to talk about restaurants and food haha
as a side note, probably ~40% of my weekly salt intake comes from ramen :upside_down_blob:
I would recommend making your inquiry more specific to get an answer
I wish my salt intake from ramen was that high
Well, I go about once a week to Santouka and that's probably 40% of the salt I have a week
(it's actually closer to once ever 1.75 weeks, but :shrug2:)
I'm a :sadpanda: I don't get to go to ramen once a week
You gotta get a ramen crew. My ramen crew was on Tuesday, it was crazy
I like the Santouka in Cambridge more hahaha
CJ is too lazy to be part of a ramen crew.
I have probably 300+ items on my list. It's too big hahaha
Yea I have to show up and do stuff
I've had both, I feel they taste the same. Cambridge has a bit bigger menu for appetizers and drinks n stuff, but the ramen tastes the same to me.
But I never got an answer! Do you have a few top food experiences?
Japan: Kobe beef (went to Kobe for it), ramen, tuna sashimi at the fish market
Thailand: pad Thai &amp; other stuff
I agree with all of those things. The tuna sashimi at the Tsukiji market was probably the best thing I've ever eaten
Hong Kong &amp; China
Beijing duck 
Is it anything like what you get in America?
Chengdu rabbit 
At *actual* chinese restaurants, not american chinese
Ummmmmmmm 
Clay pot rice
Scallion pancake
Roasted meat
Live chicken 
Roasted meat? Live chicken? I feel that those are cooking ideas, not specific best foods haha
<@UDC03KCGK> I have a bar I want to take you to
Have you been to shore leave
Basement tiki bar with some very interesting drinks
Ambiance is :ok_hand:
We were just there tonight!
Were you there too?
Yes we were!
LMAO! Well, we were at a table from 5:30-7:30, so we must have just been entirely unaware either of us were there. Drinks were great, though we ordered a lot of the small plates for food and were a bit unimpressed. The ambiance is nice though and I would definitely go back for a drink again. 
Kind of wish the bathroom music though played in the front of the house occasionally (Sea shanties!)
&gt; A 3% Kitchen Team Administration Fee will be added to your bill. This fee will solely benefit our Kitchen Team in the form of increased wages, benefits, and a sustainable schedule. This fee does not represent a gratuity or service charge for waitstaff, service employees or service bartenders.  Thank you in advance for your support and your patronage.
wait, but what?
Drinks look real cool tho
What's weird about the 3%? That's a thing now
We must have arrive just after you left, we had dinner at estragon tapas and took the silver line over to shore leave
we sat at the bar near the door
marissa really wanted to get the volcano drink that's on fire and meant for 2
That's a thing now? Why not just increase prices by 3%... that feels kinda scummy to me
I have the other opinion
if I thought they were just raising prices arbitrarily, I might object more
Like, if I opened a store that advertised prices that were 10% cheaper than everywhere else, but added an addendum that was like "we add a surcharge of 14% to all items to make sure people can have better wages"
That feels like it's circumventing posted prices
ahh, I see what you're saying
yeah the price with the 3% should be on menu
I dislike the american way of obfuscating pricing
They had a whole page on it in the menu. Also people balk at higher prices as much as they say they'd rather just have increased prices and no tips
if the menu says $1, then it should cost $1 after tax and anything else
it's part of why I stopped carrying cash other than credit card perks
It enrages me that they don't price things to whole dollars
I agree with you Brenden, but tax is something that is assumed in america
And arbitrary 3% isn't
and it shouldn't be
foreigners come here and are confused at the price differential
I agree with that, but it is. I'd much prefer we were like Switzerland or other countries that have tax included, but it is a culture thing here
I get what you're saying; I say fuck that
fuck our culture
But imagine if McDonalds were to do the same thing... have a little thing on the bottom of the menu that says "Everything is 5% higher"
I don't get the point of using a second food place as an analogy
what's the difference?
I mean, I get the frustration, I really do. Talked to Dakota a ton on this while we were drunk. Tipping fucking sucks. But until you get it un done at a legal level, trying to be the crusader that does away with it individually just fucks over every server and bartender you interact with.
There is no difference <@UETS9HTSS> - I didn't finish my thought cause something else distracted me haha
I meant to say that "there would probably be crazy outrage if that happened. And probably legal issues"
When someone pays cash at Time Out and doesn't tip, I physically lose money to serve them. So if your point is to make a stand against tipping, what instead happens is inadvertently "You, the bartender, should pay for the privilege of serving me beer"
And yea <@UDC03KCGK>I dislike it, but I still tip ofc
Unless I order takeout. Then I ain't tipping
Same thing happens there though. Delivery drivers wages depend on tips
which I think is bonkers
No, I tip delivery
Just not takeout
I get why I need to tip drivers
but I still think it's ridiculous that you get charged a delivery fee AND pay the drivers wage as a tip
what's the delivery fee for?
(I was going to say the same thing Brenden :poke-laugh: )
I'm not honestly sure what the delivery fee goes to. If it is GrubHub or doordash it is going to the service. Like a service fee on a ticket site
Does it though? Because some/most restaurants in CT had free delivery through Grubhub. I doubt (could be wrong) that the restaurant is eating the cost
They are definitely eating the cost
Restaurants run on really thin margins and do a lot just to get extra sales.
Well Grubhub probably takes a (small) % of sales. I wonder if that goes down if you don't have delivery fees
Now, as far as tipping as a whole goes, I'm not going to cry and say it doesn't end up being my worthwhile to work for tips. However, if the vast majority of people stopped tipping, you'd see a pretty drastic shift in either meal prices, or the quality of staff actually giving you food and drinks
Also as far as small %, I don't know how small you think is small. It's probably fairly egregious in all honesty
For example Upwork for freelancing is 20%
Even at volume for a single client it is 5-10%
Also: Tipping ruine Uber
Yea, meal prices would go up 12-15%. That's really not a bad thing for transparency. I doubt that it'd make much of a difference for quality of staff, except *maybe* at bars
I've never tipped an Uber... is that bad?
I also never take their water or anything they offer
&gt; The size of GrubHub’s cut varies depending on how much the restaurant is promoted. The prospectus explains, “Restaurants can choose their level of commission rate, at or above the company’s base rates, to affect their relative priority in its sorting algorithms, with restaurants paying higher commission rates generally appearing higher in the search order than restaurants paying lower commission rates.”
Okay, that's mad scummy
<http://qz.com|qz.com>, who I've never heard of before, says it's 5-15%
Feelsbad :disappointed:
Oh man, if you think wait staff and bars would be similar you're crazy.
Because the restaurants wouldn't probably make it paying workers $25 an hour. And you wouldn't get the same people working if you paid it as a minimum wage job
I feel like I rarely get a waiter that goes above and beyond for a better tip
Theoretically (like how it works in Switzerland), they do get paid well
Cause all the money you'd normally pay for a tip is part of the cost of the food
Sure, but you think the US is Switzerland?
And the restaurant actually pays that much more
Nope, which is why I said that it's part of American culture
I'm just saying if you paid our servers and bartenders minimum wage, you'd get a bunch of crappy high school kids.
Ideal world is for tipping culture is that it's like over there. But that's not the US
Yea, they'd have to make the same amount they're making now
The better servers would go into sales or real estate. The mids who didn't have the skills to take office jobs would go and take a Target job because it's easier.
OR it could be like Japan where they don't like tips bc it would be impolite to give bad service :wishescometrue:
Right. Unfortunately here, it's a race to the bottom for a lot of restaurants. They'd have to cut wages and raise prices, but not too much or they get undercut by the competition. So they'd lose a lot of staff because they aren't making what they did before. 
Things would eventually stabilize, but it would be very different
And at worst, just increase the inequality gap more than it already is
Because a lot of those people in service would have nowhere else to go with their skills. I'm lucky that I have the degree and skillset that I'm here by choice, not lack of options
Yea, again, this is ideal state. Which I don't think would work in the US
Roasted meat is food 
You go and get a rice box with your choice of roasted duck or chicken or pork and etc
Live chicken hehehe yea that would be for cooking
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UDBGH9BMX> <@UDDE5960N> <@UDC4QL95G> <@UDL020K8D> I'm going to make jerky soon
SWEET!
How much do people want?
<@UK7V13DS7> I need you to weigh in too
I'll get whatever <@UDDE5960N> gets.
A smallish steak at a restaurant is 6-8 oz a big one is about 16 oz
Is the OZ pre or post dehydrated weight?
However much I got last time, I don't remember exactly... I paid you $10.05 for it
I am familiar when it comes to steaks at a restaurant, but when it comes to jerky i'm at a loss
Lets go with 8 oz then (post weight)
oz is post dehydration
basically 1oz of jerky takes 3oz of meat
Want me to pre-pay?
nope, please don't
pricing also won't be the same as last time
we're looking at $1.80/oz
basically I get to eat a bit over a pound of jerky for free assuming I make 6 pounds of jerky
probably going to charge non <#CDBT6UTCL|game-night-schemes> people $2/oz
:thumbsup:
Is the 1.80 different from what it used to be?
I think so
I think it was $1.5 at some point
:shrug: inflation will getcha
ordered 20 lbs of top round 1/4" steaks
this'll be interesting
Did I miss my shot? I'd take some jerky.
sorry, just saw this thread.
:hamilton:
you're not too late
Ya gotta be careful to not throw away your shot
ok, I'd take 8oz, like CJ
I already have 2 lbs spoken for :notbad:
that'll be about a third of the jerky
I would like 12 oz. Got to feed my little carnivore
I'll take the approximate same amount I did last time. Since it was $10 at 1.5 that was roughly 6 oz. I'll take 8 then
It’s food of course count me in :) please don’t food poison me though 
Will babby like beef jerky?
I will take some from CJs order as long it’s not spicy
Baby will like what I tell it hopefully
<@UDC03KCGK> I made a cinnamon/black pepper/brown sugar syrup for spiced averna hot toddys; any other ideas for cocktails with it?
Rye Old Fashioned (Bourbon works ok too)
Cinful Deeds (my drink from Time Out)
Spiced Rum Daquiri
Sazerac
Vodka Collins (maybe the black fig vodka?)
Spiced Rum mojito
Whiskey Sour
I wouldn't call it spicy, but it'll warm your mouth
was a bit heavy handed with the cayenne pepper this time around as I usually don't notice it
Food channel is so quite
Quite Quite
That's like my dream
If only I have a big stomach and all my food help me lose weight instead of gaining hehehehe
Aw man there's like not even any cheese in those dishes
actually, now that i think about it, there isn't much cheese in asian food is there?
Koreans and Japanese people like dairy in their food.
In general, adult consumption of dairy is not all that common in world cuisine. 
Lactose intolerance is quite high in Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe as a result. 
yea but they incorporate most dairy into food in those area now since they have access to it.
Dairy was too expensive in Asia but it was there
` Lactose intolerance in adulthood is most prevalent in people of East Asian descent, with 70 to 100 percent of people affected in these communities.`
this is one of the few human adaptations I'm aware of
europeans that could easily drink daily apparently flourished
Something something cold all the time
I may die base on this spice level is what I’m hearing
I can neither confirm nor deny such allegations
You won't die sweetie
Best way to prevent death is to not die
Is dairy keto?
Cheese is a staple of keto as I is low carb and high fat. Good source of calories since protine is not. Milk tends to have a good amount of sugar in it though.
This is why I am so not doing keto
<@UDC03KCGK> are you working tonight?
No, working the day shift right now till 5pm
context is if you were working, I was going to go study beer related materials at time out
*Ordered a few things:*
&gt; <https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/products/road-to-cicerone-brewing-ingredients-process-course>
&gt; <https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/products/road-to-cicerone-american-course>
&gt; <https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/products/malt-box-webinar>
&gt; <https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/products/beer-style-cards-complete-set>
So since you've been asking, this is how the studying is going
So since you've been asking, this is how the studying is going
Good stuff! Glad to see you're keeping up with it
<@UDC03KCGK> have you been to blossom Bar at Sichuan Garden yet?
Yes I have. Good stuff
Bartender is in:
Thursday 13th 4-9pm
Sunday 16th 11am - business decline (usually 7pm)
Monday 17th Noon - BD
Sunday 23rd Noon -BD
Sunday 3/1 Noon to all damn night (we still close at 9, but we have a bar clean, so who knows how long I'll be there till)
I finally got an order for a Mai Tai!
how long have you been waiting for that?
Mai Tais are delicious, but can't imagine drinking one when it's cold outside
Well I never got one ordered even at Park. Just got the mint today even!
Speaking of: Thursday from Noon to 1 we are doing bar training for the new menu. So if you show up around 12:45-1pm, there will be plenty of drinks that need giving away.
this thursday?
:disappointed:
I'll be in Seattle
perhaps next month
actually, how often does this happen?
Once a quarter
And yeah, this Thursday
ARHHHHHHH
I want to go, but I feel like getting to Park at 1pm will be difficult to justify given all the shit going on
I work at Time Out CJ
You know this
Whatever, it's still SOOOO FAR!!!!!
Not really, it's 3 stops on the D line, the Cadillac of the green line
Isn't the Green line like the :donkey: of the T lines?
D line is top :ass:
It doesn't crash or light on fire and try to kill everyone a la red or orange line
too much effort for CJ
I wanna go but I'm not allowed.
Park would be so much better for me... Drew, wanna move back there?
The D also isn’t going all the way to time out on the weekends. 
<@UDC03KCGK> can you confirm that there will be dishes without nuts for marissa tomorrow?
Nope. I can't remember if you even stopped by when I did work there
None of the dishes will have nuts in them
Thanks
Starts at 6:30? correct?
Correct
I did! I stopped by the last day you were there haha. 

But you were working there when I wasn't really hanging with you guys - unfortunate timing
Ok, so you were part of that big group. I remember now, you got the Calypso
I think I missed this dinner plan thing. What's happening?
Sam and I are hosting dinner tonight at 6:30 at our place as a "take a night off" after what happened last week
<@UETS9HTSS> <@UPGVCMGD9> dried strawberries for prego lady
Already done! Did it yesterday :)
Want more than half a pound?
yea!!!!
How big is the bag?
yea!!!!
I forgot how many in a pound
A half a pound of dried strawberries should be a decent amount Mei

<@UDDE5960N> how much do I owe Mei for hot pot?
<@UDL020K8D> &amp; @daka
<@UDL020K8D> &amp; <@UDC4QL95G> your total for hot pot been directly message to you
<@UDC03KCGK> here
LOL!
It's like a virus, confusing people with D names just spreads. I called Dave "Doug" as he was leaving the dinner
I called Dave "Brendan" last time
I mean it's just expected you'll be wrong
what kind of cake did you make?
Red velvet
not my cup of tea but people love that stuff
How do I get cake?
1. Go to grocery store
2. Buy cake ingredients or cake mix
3. Follow recipe
4. Bake batter
5. Receive cake from oven
You convince Sam to share
Booooo both of these seem to hard
And Mei wants to go to greggs so I'll just get cake there
yes I know
Red Velvet IS chocolate cake. Just use a different frosting
There's still milk in the cake. Buttermilk specifically. 
Frosting would be easy to change though
Yeah, just lick the frosting off and add a new layer :thumbsup:
Yes
They're at my house
I can grab them over lunch if you'll be at game night
duly noted
WHAT THAT'S WHERE YOUR GOING WITH KEVIN!?!?1
Now I'm jealous
We get hot pot but kevin gets Japanese BBQ. I see how it is
Yea I'm with Daka, WE SHOULD GET JAPANESE BBQ!
Also if anyone wants to try Scotch, I got a bottle of Auchentoshen (or however it is spelled) 12yr last night for free
Fancy, who did you murder?
That is a nice free gift
The bar staff
:nicee:
TIL not to put charred/blistered cherry tomatoes through a potato ricer because you don't have a potato masher.
What happened?
Uhhhhh that just sounds messy
lots of it
tomato juice and seeds shot upwards to the hood and on to my shirt
I have a ridiculously large bottle of Green Chartreuse now. They didn't have Yellow. So, Last Words anyone?
why would you ever do that.......... blender is better
Is that a threat?
For you, yes. For the rest of us, a good night of laughs
mango for breakfast
I was more playing off of `So, Last Words anyone?`
The drink is called a "Last Word"
I know, it was a joke
GOSH
And CJ the drink you're thinking of is a Naked and Famous
But they didn't have Yellow. I'm honestly not sure how many drinks even use Green
I got the joke, and I understood the drinks name. I was just more commenting on how when drew makes drinks like that Dakota pays for it and the rest of us get amazing stories
He apparently cleaned up the puke according to the bartender
the recipe called for mashing them, not blending
as it was supposed to still have chunks of tomato skin that was blistered/charred at the end
ewwwww puking sucks
stop drinking Daka
you could do a pulse not a blend in the blender, works about the same if you want it chunky
To be fair, it wasn't Daka's puke
It was Drew's
Yeah, i'm the one who got us home that night!
Its great because we were both trashed, drew was just so much more-so that the fact that I don't remember most of that night is overshadowed.
-__- no comment
I want some Last Resorts, but don't want to go all the way into the city lol. Have fun all!
Is there a reasonable mid point for you?
So I'm now mildly excited for this quarantine to end as I just bought a Glion Dolly (electric scooter) and that really expands the radius that I can reasonably go to grab lunch from the office :yay_tomato: (and makes getting to the gym much easier)
I'm going to be hitting New Saigon way more often :hy::pe:
Oh, I think I’ve walked there for lunch a couple times. Good sandwiches. 
Nice, I can join you on being excited for the quarantines to end too...
Don't worry Drew your quarantine will be extended
New Saigon in chinatown use to be so much bettery
Lunch today is korean sushi Caled gimbap 
That looks delicious! I really need more seaweed wraps, ran out of mine. You have any favorite brand/place to buy?
I go to hmart, Japanese market or Chinese market depending on where I’m shopping at the time. If you have a car you are kind of close to a Japanese market called ebisuya or go to this Japanese market at Coolidge Corner
Kimchi 
<@UHQD9J1SL> check put my kimchi
wow!!!
i thoguht it takes a few days? but this looks so beautiful
You can eat it fresh or wait for it to ferment in a few days for a more sour taste
oooh, would eat. :slightly_smiling_face:
Do you eat kimchi?
yeah. I’ve never tried making it, but I’ve eaten it
Making it takes so much work it was a 4-5 hr process 
I think everyone should post their food pic here daily
i had the samyang 2x ramen today. its the best thing ive eaten in a while. my stomach still feels 'warm' after 5 hours
sounds spicy
Woah. 
im ordering the sauce now
yes i needed ice cream after but it was SO good
I had french toast this morning. :slightly_smiling_face:

I fried a couple eggs for breakfast. Just had tortellini for dinner. 
French toast and bacon been our normal breakfast
youre done with dinner???
I accidentally skipped lunch m, so early dinner. I’m probably going to have another pass at that tortellini at some point tonight. 
I had chicken nuggets for lunch today
yum
i had............. a sourdough sandwich
I've had a go to lunch of sliced hard salami, some kind of cheese like gouda or extra aged cheddar, and pita crackers (the ones from trader joe's that are super addicting)
Leftovers. 
I had a bagel with butter

Spam is such an unappetizing word. Terrible name for food. 
The Asian's love it!
the food or the name?
The food
Both
I object :stuck_out_tongue:
That Asian's love it?
Aysh is Asian…
Yes, but is she just Asian, or does India count in the group we decide to identify as Southeast Asian?
I get she's Asian, but I was trying to figure out what she was objecting to
i dont know, i think SE Asian but i dont get that option in demographics surveys ever , so im gonna object to asians liking spam :stuck_out_tongue:
valid!
Yea, I was going to do that this weekend, but the local Asian market isn't stocking the fish (or much of it) during the pandemic
:sadpotato:
Make sure it’s sushi grade if you want it for sushi :) or get frozen eel, easier to get
Hey <@UDC03KCGK>  and <@UETS9HTSS> is this a real drink:

Tequila
Cointreau
Lime
Ice
Salt
throw some simple syrup or agave syrup in there and you have a marg
<@UDC4QL95G>
What if you don't like sweet and sour mix. Does that make a difference
not sweet and sour mix
simple syrup
literally sweetener
Thanks for settling that argument

Actually, if you do the right proportions, Dakota has a Margarita without the simple syrup or agave

Sweet and sour is both not necessary but actually makes for a worse drink
Brenden and I are both right weirdly though as the Margarita is a more subtly complicated drink than most people give it credit. Making it with Agave would be traditional. Making it without would be classic. Making it with Agave and no Cointreau is fucked up but taught by a leading bartender training program. Making it with Sweet and Sour mix is for dive bars and people who grew up between the 60' to mid 90's (ie. Most of our parents)
Spam!!!
sambar , yes
Dosa- i dont make the batter because i dont have a super strong blender
I like sambar so much but it feels intimating to get all the ingredients and to cook it
<https://www.amazon.com/MTR-Sambar-Instant-7-05-Oz-Pouches/dp/B000MITCWC>

This is really good, just add veg kind. Currently sold out- i can try finding it elsewhere
but also- if you have the ingredients its just a matter of boiling it all together

I may try to find it at a Indian grocery store
