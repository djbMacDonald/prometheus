Doug did you kill the fact that it would post messages to logs?
will check now
yeah, chaos-monkey logs are up to date. I see you talking about Iran
hmmm ok, I'm probably being stupid.  Thanks Doug
its in the deja vu bot
all functionality is in bots now. The server.py now only serves to instantiate and trigger them
Oh, know i was trying to figure out what Marissa's id is
Which I usually just go into the logs after pinging people
but some reason I'm not seeing messages post to them
you can click on her directly to see it
Thanks!
for the impersonations, I wasn't sure where the image URLs came from
That's totally a dakota thing, like I said, glitch use to have the full json printed to the log file
I'm assuming that's where dakota got them from
oh, those logs. yeah, I cut some of that out, hoping to make it more obvious when errors were happening.
there was too much normal text to sift through
Yea, we tended to use those in order to back into what we wanted slack to do
You know, reverse engineering instead of reading documentation
yeah, I used it a bit as well. but turned it off once I got what I needed from it.
click name, right click, copy image url
that's simpler than I was making it out to be.

Unintended interaction. Kind of funny. I like it. 
wait, if there is a matching emoji, does it react to it?
Look at bots/lol.py   I added it last night. 
Hm, that should have done it.

I think the get_all_emojis call returns an object that is too big. You should search for a specific emoji instead
Oooohhh

you can add a query param
Hm, I’ll have to figure out how to redo the bot spam bot as well. 
wait, if there is a matching emoji, does it react to it?
Maybe it’s just not worth it. 
I stored a big json of all the emojis for the old spam bot, but that will be a pretty big file
Or maybe mongo will help here.

oh could be a good use for mongo. I could also update my emoji script to upload a doc for each new emoji as well
I turned off lol_bot and spam_bot for now.
I don't see a query param listed on the API
```  url = '<https://games-club-external.slack.com/api/emoji.adminList?token=>{}&amp;queries=["{}"]&amp;count=100000'.format(os.environ.get('MEGA'), searchTerm)```
I didn't see emoji.adminList on the api docs
only emoji.list
I hate the slack api docs
Yea they suck
every with this knowledge I cannot find confirmation online that emoji.adminList exists.
adminList is not official
so you're using an internal api?
if you look at the network requets, you can see it is an api used by the slack website

Why does scrambler have 0.1 frequency *100?
because to convert from a decimal to a percent, you need to multiply it by 100
0.1 * 100 = 10%
We had it set to way lower than that
Unable to confirm after refactor
I invited you to edit. changing _frequency should work
Watching you code feels like watching you have a stroke in real time
Who is editing it at the same time?
I was trying to make prometheus less broken
you somehow broke prometheus
I have not idea how
At least from how it is updating on my end
I fixed what jumped out to me, but you'd have to rewind to yesterday to see if I missed some more
i think there was some weird desync since I wasn't copy-pasting anything
wtf i just refreshed and the code looks TOTALLY different
Have you looked at the scrambler bot code?
You put in some WEIRD copy pastes
alright it is back up. That was super odd
I understand the stroke comment now
Huh, so what happened?
I was going to go back and fix the code but you'd already fixed/restored it
wtf i just refreshed and the code looks TOTALLY different
i think there was some weird desync since I wasn't copy-pasting anything
_frequency = .01 is 1 in 100. That is what scrambler was set to before the refactor. <@UDC03KCGK>
If you'd like it lower, that totally works as well
oh, you said .1. yeah, that looks like a typo
you changed Scrambler to CJ? He's already being hit by pig latin
...sigh, way to kill a joke Doug
eventually I think there should be a bot for all you. Drew has scramble, CJ has pig latin, Brenden has dashes. I've haven't spent much time brainstorming though.
I have "Dakota Gave Us Fire" techinically
CJ also has an emoji spam bot somwehere
and any time he says stabby
people can have multiple.
oh, I turned off old spam bot when I thought I had a replacement for everyone. I should turn it back on.
megamoji cj-spam back on for now.

WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
Where are the bot calls?
?
How do you add a new bot to the list of bots checks
ah
?
you no longer need to do that
just add the bot to the bots folder
It automatically imports all bots from the dierectory
you just need the run function
neat
(describe is a nice to have, but not a requireemnt)

NEAT I SAID

ah, a third person bot

oh ... it's nice

identity undef
hmmmm
use `dentity = IDENTITIES[self._event.user()]`
But I shouldn't need to declare that because it's part of the inhertance of Bots isn't it?
nope.
that's `_identityUtil`
which is different
so many pings!

<@UDDE5960N> you still want the .userName, etc

true but invalid syntax in a bot still does

:lol:
you might not be able to catch compile problems
is invalid syntax catchable?
i
I don't think so
I think your code will break if the word starts with I
there is no space on the left
possibly, not sure
i
there should be some regex you can reuse in the redacted bot
for banned words
i'm sad
i'm sad
Yes, you did say neat
Ok that got rid of the duplicat problem
Under the new regime
I want to fix this.
the whole point of the refactor was to allow me to work on . that problem.
I really like that breaking a bot no longer kills all the bots.
So, if the scramble bot fires for me, but I say something redacted, how does the refactor handle this?
it will post both
I think it will delete your message, then double post
I'm happy
I did it!
<@UDC03KCGK> I think it would be great if it posted a scrambled message with redactions
but that's more difficult
That'd be hilarious, but we'd have to create a queue for the bots, right?
while still allowing people to make bots willy-nilly
yeah
that's my current idea.
but I'd hide it from the bot author.
hence moving all posts to the utility.
theoretically, you could add another standard method to all bots called 'execute' or something
first run through each bot, and set a flag on the slack event for each bot that triggers
then call the execute method on each flagged bot
New bot complete
all posting is now hidden behind the util. so you can sub out posting, for enqueuing without anyone noticing
I am complete
Version 1 complete
The bot might not be complete till version 4
This both is not for yoU!
It hasn't gone through QC, ipso facto, <@UETS9HTSS>
Although I was debating on making it an array so everyone would have a different probability
you could have to figure how to merge the strings properly, which in a scrambled + redacted message wouldn't work too well
yeah, that's the part I don't know how its going to look yet.
How do the bots deal with situations in which they both should fire?
brenden cannot test a bot he cannot trigger!
they both fire
Under the new regime
lol
but controlling the post process was needed for any changes.
Why would that matter? Scramble the message first, then redact it. Hold the string in queue as a variable
the whole point of the refactor was to allow me to work on . that problem.
that works for those two bots. I want it to work for any possible bots
This was specifically talking about queuing the posts
if you queue the posts, you don't know what happened, just the new content
This is a bot only targeting CJ?
That seems less chaotic
It should only target Aysh
You would need to seperate the trigger and the post action
what if the bug is that anyone can trigger it
dunno, haven't checked the target
It's literally the most Aysh bot I've ever seen
:hyper-think:
yeah, that's an option
So first all the bots get the unaltered message to see if they need to do something, and then bots get a chance to mess with the message before it's posted
a bot might need "firing criteria" and a seperate "run"
I literally just suggested that!
You'd have problems with Pig and redact, but that should be pretty small
right before "New Bot Complete"
Yea but you're queing them, I'm saying you seperate out the trigger from the run and que both of them!
missed it. blame CJ's fire image
.... cj, read 2 posts before the start of this thread
You have no idea who the bot targets now
<@UDDE5960N>
Make it at least target Aysh
Although I do really want to make it an array so it affects everyone differently
But CJ eli5
the one hurdle here is that bots then can be acting on messages no longing in their criteria once they act. That itself is a good thing, but it means people will need to think about more general cases when they are writing.

There should probably be some system to say we want one bot to run before another. Like censor should run before pigLatin
<@UDDE5960N> :bug: what if your message ends in `i`
&gt; *Michael:* Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
&gt; *Oscar:* Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
&gt; *Michael:* Ho-oh!
&gt; *Oscar:* So you have an extra dollar.
&gt; *Michael:* Yeah.
&gt; *Oscar:* So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
&gt; *Michael:* I'll be six.
NO ONE READS THE MAIN THREAD IN THE TEST CHANNEL!
CLEARLY WE'RE TALKING IN THREAD HERE!
Who'se fault is that!
What english sentence ends with subject at the end?!?!?!
Expect for maybe `not i`
true. some sort of `_weight` to each bot
unexpected
that way if you have a bot that needs to act first, set the wight super low/high
you!
you would also need a method to indicate that "if this bot runs, stop all other execution "
`_final` or `_stopProcessing`
"if this bot runs, stop all other execution " &lt;- that already exists, although its hacky
test
test
This thread made me laugh more than Chaos Monkey did today
ah, figured out the duplicates. I didn't stop it from triggering off bots. The bot was triggering itself in a loop
interesting that it cut out after 4 times
alright, another day with 2 new bots
you can say that again
you can say that again

<@UDC4QL95G> I think say again works now. I just don't have an impersonation (and am not making one) so it will break for me.

mongo persistance will come in handy there.

ah, good to klnow
Request: make this an ephemeral message with an attached Roll button. Use the following link to schedule "well you failed" message to the channel that gets cancelled if they click the roll button. When they click the roll button, you can roll your own dice and post a message with the outcome.

<https://api.slack.com/messaging/scheduling>
<@UDL020K8D>
you could give each skill type a pass, fail, critical pass, and critical failure action, and each action the same sort of results of the check
hm, it was not really meant as an interactive thing, more a conversation starter.
making it ephemeral kind of defeats that.
it still would be if they choose not to click the button, or don't see it
the scheduled message would NOT be ephemeral, nor would any result from clicking the button
you could also give them something like only 10 seconds to roll, that way the messages go from "do a check" to "you failed/succeeded the check"
either way, just a reason to play with scheduled messages and message attachments. The bot is also fine the way it is currently
I can look into at some point. we'll see when I have time/interest again
fair
DM bot from 1 in 50 to 1 in 100
<@UDL020K8D> we should probably get in the habit of having the bots leave some sort of emoji like :dejavu:, I feel like the pig latin bot can be confusing if you don't realize it
Yup that
<@UDL020K8D> bots should have visible tells
I thought the different name was the tell
All bots repost with the same name, so :dejavu:, botify, and pig latin all use `CJ O'Stabby`
oh, you want multiple impersonations for the same person?
Nah i was thinking emoji's
Like :dejavu:
So each bot would have it's own :fingerprint:
that is doable. but its pretty obvious when a pig latin happens.
True, just more food for thought as we implement more bots
it is possible
Well DejaVu happens because it posts an orignal message. Most other bots replace the original
DejaVu needed it's own because it literally posts text that happened in the channel previously
<@UDC4QL95G> memory at 90%
yeah it seems to resolve itself when it does that though
not sure what causes it
probably the Pool
hm. at least pool is set up as a singleton right now.
We should find the fun line in general. Scrambler and pig latin are both very difficult to read. Is that ok in general?
They are ok as long as they are rarer than other bots
Bots like the one that just randomly makes CJ's text an impersonation can be more commen
but the goal is to make no one bot actually annoying
It took me a while to tune Dakota's fire/box probability
Can't you post the new message, then emoji it?
Maybe? We currently do not have any events listening for other events. It depends on if any given post returns the ID of the message it posted
you can say that again
you can say that again
that was super weird
glitch is having memory issues today
<@UDC4QL95G> I copied the is a bot logic from the old one. I actually don't know if its right. There is a weird double not
yeah that was intentional
memory back to normal now
i think memeory spikes when it does an api call
<@UDC4QL95G> is the prometheus image url saved somewhere? Right now the DM bot can't reference it, it shows a generic person image.
like the profile picture, or the one that comes up when it says "Dakota Gave us Fire"
Fire bot uses the random function
oh, if you don't include an image url, it will default to the app image
I think
unless slack updated
It must have updated
I vaguely remember all applications being given separate permissions for bot users. It is probably that update

I think I'm pretty close to having this bot's settings controlled from mongo. you can change target and frequency with a slash command
oh nice
<@UDC4QL95G> one more time
sorry for delay
test
ok, bugs look to be worked out now. so what you can do:
`/bot configure frequency code .02`
or
`/bot configure target code Dakota`

where `code` is the bot name. (in this case, the name is `code`)
that will let you change target and frequency on the fly.
I have a fair bit of re-writing to do before we can get all the bots doing this.
That's incredible
And perfect for ultimate chaos
double deja vu there is odd
that's the second double dejavu in two days, however this time the second reaction didn't happen
<@UDC4QL95G> I re-aimed the ban slash command to buttery waxflower. so you should be able to play around with that some now.
<@UDC4QL95G> memory was a 99%. I commented out the mongo client and it dropped to 10%.
was trying to figure out why my message replace for you wasn't working, but also wasn't throwing errors.
Another proof of concept to play with doug
type /cast
<@UDL020K8D>
could be good for an actual UI for configuring bot targets and frequencies
I DON"T KNOW WHAT IT DOES BUT I LIKE IT!
Basically, code now exists that makes an interactable popup. More of a "here is a place to start working on a UI if you want one"
I like to dance
Config files are small enough that we can store them in files, like the chat history (although that is not small anymore). With the UI we could get this working pretty quickly. 
working pretty quickly?
I'm silly
I'm not silly
bot idea; load up some lyrics, randomly choose 1 line
so it must be a snippet between punctuation, so you likely won't be able to identify the song
and we can speculate where it came from
this is totally not what I'm doing in <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
we'd just need a site to draw random lyrics off of. all the rest is pretty easy to hook up
five minutes later, post a link in a thread what song it came from
or spend too long manually added some
so we can be vindicated if we were right about what song it came from

Awkward
<@UDC03KCGK> scrambler bot odds are now 15%/count of words
So if you have 15 words it's back to 1 percent
I don't think that is 15% per count of words. That would be 15 words for every 100
Like, this is going to be super common, unless it is 15% per count of words per post

`/cast` has been updated a bit
Now i just gotta make it actually _do_ something
Plan is to use a quicktime.py event to counter a spell, and if they don't do it it time, inflict a status on them that will cause a given bot to trigger 100% of the time for X messages (or time)
*Slackbot*  [4:12 PM]
*/cast* failed with the error "operation_timeout"
did the popup come up though?
sometimes it says timeout, but still comes up
I think it's because it is loading those images
yes, but it didn't do anything
well yeah `Now i just gotta make it actually _do_ something`
Also I can't select fireball :disappointed:

currently `/cast` and `/bot list` are set up to use `Modal.Open` if . you look at the `/bot` and `/cast` sections
I AM SO FUCKING HAPPY DAKOTA!
I take it you clicked the Cast button?
Fuck yea
`*/cast* failed with the error "http_service_error"`
Does cast actually do anything yet?
hmmm cast may not work for chaos users...
and no it does not
well, except for the Cast button
BUT THE BUTTON TOLD ME IT WORKS AND TO BE HAPPY!
yeah, works as in it actually did literally ANTTHINg
it works better than the other buttons on the screen
I've also not decided now exactly I want the status effects to apply
<@UDC4QL95G> I don’t see crabby bot. 
I just deleted it
Ok, I’ll write it back up. 
Didn't wanna try to fix the code on my phone, so that was the quickest I could fix it
<@UDDE5960N> you can now select your spell in `/cast`
LIES!!!!!! I have *Slackbot*  [4:54 PM]
*/cast* failed with the error "operation_timeout"

<@UDL020K8D> there is an issue somewhere that causes each event to trigger another instance of python3
which is leading to our memory issues
It's probably that failure of an attempt at making the post messages async
Wait what?!?!?!
prometheus is spinning up another prometheus every time a message gets posted or something like that
No I get that's what happening, I'm just shocked you write code that triggered it
No I get that's what happening, I'm just shocked you write code that triggered it

Alright memory issues should be solved, think we could probably turn back on MongoDB
Dakota watcha doing?
`/chaos` 
I was only set up for half of it!
It doesn't actually load any real data
booooo
make the ui pop up and making it DO anything are 2 very different things
I feel like all your UI skills will go for naught if we can't get some state info/db connection
Thats the thing. We removed the DB because the Memory issue. The memory issue has been resolved, which means the DB is back on the table
Ohhhh fancy
if you are bored, you could always program the `/cast` and `/chaos` commands to actually do something
Just look at slackevent.py in the model folder
and ignore `next(iter(next(iter(event.get('view').get('state').get('values').values())).values())).get('selected_option').get('value');`

bot idea:
turn sentences in to awful uses of contractions
Today I was going to have peanuts, but not unshelled ones as unshelled peanuts are too much work to eat
becomes:
Today I was going to've peanuts, butn't unshelled ones as unshelled peanuts're too much work to eat
so blanket replacements like:
([a-zA-Z]) have
$1've
could probably just do a straight replace of " have" "'ve"
nah, then shit like this happens
You haven't done that, have you?
You 'ven't done that,'ve you?
I mean isn't that the point though?
I don't like ,`'`
Even with your text you'd still end up with You'ven't
which is hilarious
`You'ven't done that've you?`
That sounds kinda hilarious
That sounds annoying to write

I can't wait to slay drew repeatedly
Lol I still don't know how I want spells to work...
Some way in which I will have a permanent, preferably insurmountable, advantage over drew
You have access to the source code, it wouldn't be too hard to tweak something here or there
I mean yea, that's why
The spells are just listed in constant/spells.py
and the spells assigned will be stored in the db.
Really the only things to work out are:
 how to force a bot to always apply to a user message (probably easy)
 How mana should work
 Reactions to spells
 How stats should come into play
 how to gain stats
I mean the other thing is what do you want to be able to achieve with spells
Nah that's easy
spells inflict statuses, which give a 100% chance for that status bot to activate on a user message
Cause like if it's FFA won't you save mana for Reactions
I'm thinking there will be 2 ways to cast spells
Ritual and Flashcast
Flashcasting spells will not last as long, cost more mana, but apply instantly or something like that
Rituals will take some amount of time, were the target has a chance of countering the spell somehow
so you've created sorceries, instants, and interrupts.
Yup
Well, i haven't created any of them yet. Just a vague idea of what I want to do

I have a bot idea!
You know how people can read messages if the first letter and last letter of every word is in the right spot, and then the other correct letters are there, just scrambled inbetween? Basically like the scrambler bot that works on me, but it is still completely readable
Lkie tihs for eamxlpe
I hear you have a lot of time on your hands. Perfect time to learn to write a bot!
That depends on how you approach "A lot of time"
I haven't been going to a job
That doesn't mean I've had a lot of time
hey <@UDC4QL95G> do we take incoming web hooks in prometheus?
We could. Currently we just use event listeners
I'd like to use prometheus for civ 6 webhooks for turn notifications in <#C011E259FR8|civ>
as we need to do some processing to the json object sent with the post before sending to channel
and mapping civ usernames to @mentions would be nice to have
speaking of which, would you be interested in an asynchronous civ 6 game?
this should be easy enough to write up. I'll have it out soon.
hm, core of the scrambler is in place. I'm not sure how to not strip out punctuation yet.
test message
test message
test message

ok, connected now. Should respect punctuation. I made it only scramble a single word for now. we'll see if its noticable
nice
nice

ok, nice-bot should now respond with all impersonations once, except for you.
It occurs to me that we can read emotes on a message. We could probably have Prometheus actually copy them over when replacing a post, stopping the case we saw yesterday where a deja vu seemed to come out of nowhere because we lost the emote
test
lol
test
that shouldn't have happened. hm
test

Hey did something change about the scrambler odds? The /bot list command shows `500%/(Word Count)^2` and that doesn't seem to be what <@UDDE5960N> described before. The concept is the same but the 500% looks wonky
<@UDL020K8D>
I don't think I messed with the odds.
what would you like it to be?
That's what it is
with a word count greater than 3
That's what it has always been since you tweaked it CJ?
yes
Interesting
Ok, just went through some of the math. Can we tweak that to 450? That makes a solid 50% chance at 3 words
Or did you make it so it doesn't kick in until 4?
kicks in at 4
more than 3, not more than or equal to
I'd say kick it in &gt;2, but make it 450 instead of 500. That way it scrambles less often with the 7+ words
Because between 3-7, the message is readable. So I just let it lie and people know what I said. It's a bit too common above that range and requires a lot of retyping and what not that it is less fun and more just mosquito level nuisance
10.2 vs 9.2%
So you want an additional 1%?
spongebob-mock
spongebob-mock
I figure it is a small enough tweak, and it doesn't sacrifice the odds you were shooting for with ~50% chance to scramble a low count sentence
8 words is 7.8 vs 7.0, so it's not even a point
I'm trying to lead with a compromise
spongebob-mock
No drew, what i'm saying is the 50% isn't real
ok, mock should respond to a bot and not go infinite
it's 5/n^2
it's a square decay
Ok, so 4/n^2
?
it's not 50% odds, because the odds don't exist till you have a n
Sure I'm fine with that
Thank you!
I'm more so pushing for meaningful change
8%&lt; or less for words greater than 7
Cool, thank you
added min words to description so you can read it off `/bot list`
also, I think I have an idea to make the bots play better together so we don't end up with the chaos seed getting pulled into the main channel when botify triggers. I expect to have more to share about with that later today.
That sounds great. Really glad you've taken such an invested interest in our horde of bots
helps that I have a ticket I'm working for work on that I don't actually want to think about

```def messageMatchesText(self, message, matchText, ignoreCase):
    if ignoreCase:

that's throwing exeptions for every message sent
`NameError: name 'text' is not defined`

or the parameter message is supposed to be called text?

interesting. so instead of botify showing "CJ O'Stabby" it would just show "CJ"?
surprised it didn't throw a syntax error
yeah, python is weird and dumb
also, I noticed the auto "nice"s didn't get a reaction added properly. I'll have to look into that.
nice
oh right, I had to turn that off when the spongbob mock when infinite
Yup.
idk, I don't really like the idea of putting words in someone's mouth without some clear indication of what's going on (like the deja vu icon)
Well, the funny part is that when it unmorphs, all the text in the past will revert to prometheus
and currently, we only use the prometheus user for Reactions. it would be a new functionality, like morph, then say the exact same thing again, but in all caps and exclamation points
I think deja vu is broken right now, but I can't connect to glitch right now to look into it

fixed
any idea what the issue was?
Nope. didn't even check. I just timed out the ban
So, bans don’t technically reset every day. Every time you post, it checks if the old ban has been out for 24 hours or more. if so, it creates a new ban and records the time. So in theory, if there is a day no one posts until noon, that means the next day the ban won’t update until noon as well.
so without looking at the file directly, its hard to know when a ban is supposed to reset.
we could probably make it a true daily ban if you wanted, but that would require some effort.
I though at some point I went back and fixed it to reset at 8:00AM the next day
I don’t see that in the code.
`expirationDate = int(round(time.time())) + int(round(((24 - n.hour - 2) * 60 * 60) + ((60 - n.minute - 1) * 60) + (60 - n.second)))`

ok, try a test post at 12:57 today. Is it doesn’t change then we know there is a problem. Eventually we should move to a daily ban word. It just will require some time and attention.
<@UDC4QL95G> do you know what the deal with the `_bot.cpython-37.pyc.140200824985520` file is? There is nothing in it I don’t know where it came from.
not a clue
I’m going to delete it, just t o see if something explodes.
testing
eh, seems like stuff is working
<@UDC03KCGK> say something with ‘a’
A trifle of a request
Boo
ok, it might be broken
This is a test

<@UDC03KCGK> there is problem with timing. too few digits. current word will be banned for long time. possibly years. Will attempt to fix now.

Where do you opt in/out of bots?

Comment out your line in `IDENTITIES`
I’ll turn censor off for a while

<@UDC03KCGK> <@UDC4QL95G> censor back on. I moved it to operate on a truly daily basis. Should only look at the date of the ban. I also forced it to update the ban, so it should no long be ‘a’
test
although looks like today’s ban word is rath unlikely to pop up in natural conversation.
Thanks Doug! Much appreciated!

<@UDC4QL95G> looks like the Prometheus disk space is creeping up. We’re up to 77% right now
git garbage collect knocked it back to 69%
I need to update the ban ban list to include "of"
"o f"
lol
Is there no way to comment blocks of code in Python?
Is there no way to comment blocks of code in Python?
Apparently in Pycharm I can just highlight an do a shit ton of line comments with a single keystroke, so I guess that's sufficient
yeah most IDE's have that feature
There is likely another method you can use to edit multiple places at once. Try holding alt or alt+shift and draging up or down
Prometheus also has the code block feature in it's dev environment
Does ayone code without an IDE?

<@UDC4QL95G> are you working on the censor bot right now? Or are those alerts that we should look into?
Nope, I figured it was you or drew playing around with the bota
<@UDC03KCGK> ?
<@UDC4QL95G> did you try to manually add a ban? Looks like a second ban was added, but the formatting was off. I’ll check the ban words functionality.
lol
I have not played with the bots. That will be made very clear that I am beginning to tinker with them when I do

<!here> I'll try to take a look at getting Prometheus into git today.
So fancy
if we lost the project I don't know that any of us wants to start writing from stratch.
True that!
<!here> current code is now saved to a git repo in my name. I’ll poke around with getting you all access and making sure they stay in sync
if you have a github account, let me know your username and I’ll add you.
