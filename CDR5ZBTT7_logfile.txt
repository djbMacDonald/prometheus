:big_think:
Ok, it's super confusing to someone not use to it
just pinged toast for you to whitelist you
found your application
yea?
hey drew i think i have your DejaVu working, how rare do you want it to be
I think 1/75 to start
Cool, it now keeps a list of every message sent (per channel). Currently, it is set up to clear the log each time a DejaVu happens, is that what you want?
I would not want it to clear the log, but if that will affect processing time greatly, clearing the log is not the worst thing.
So you want it to repeat things multiple times?
We post enough that that is rare
Hi Prometheus
But I want it to post stuff from last week or so which clearing the log would not be able to do unless we make the bot extremely rare
I think it over writes itself way faster than that dude
there is no performance hit
```#Drew says don't clear the file. What a Jerk
      #self.logToNewFile()```
I mean I can go into the log files and do what I want!
I CAN ADD NEW SAYINGS JUST TO FUCK WITH YOU!
they dont actually appear to update in real time
not sure why
I don't understand the log file naming convention by the way
stabby
hehehehehe
awwwww
also the word stabby can be anywhere in the sentense?
Capt stabby is coming for you
wait, why does it rearrange itself
Cause it doesn't like you
huh
it seems like it moves it around randomly
Also it looks like it's only on my next message
Nahhh it's in order of the emoji
but it's not always the same
nevermind
I don't know
that is weird
the rows are alphabetical, but the rows contain different emoji's
it seems to alphabatize twice

YOU TELL HIM!

Hi Prometheus

Hi Prometheus

you're whitelisted
YEA!!!!
TO DYING A LOT!
IN EXPLOSIONS!
I'll be impressed if you die that much TBH
unless you want to try out the nuclear reactor mod
in which case, you'll die a hell of a lot
from explosions and radiation
Ummmm what????? And hell yes!
<@UDC4QL95G> WE'RE BUILDING A NUCLEAR REACTOR!
I'm not even sure what it does, but now I just want one
Sounds like it's gonna need a lot of resources
I've released my super secret emoji grabbing scripts into #emoji-enthusiasts. I am looking forward to seeing where this goes
yep
lots of uranium, probably thorium at some point depending on how far you delve into the mod
I am concerned about this world we're going to be in
Because in my experiences diamonds are the things I go looking for
alright just applied
now we just need <@UDC03KCGK> in here
we need a goon to put to working mining diamonds
oh god... i just figured out how to make my stabby bot work on wayfair slack.
oh god... i just figured out how to make my stabby bot work on wayfair slack.
I could write a script that would auto-react to all posts in #announcements-global

And no
Ummmm.... what??
Ummmm.... what??
And no
agreed
Ummmm.... what??
And no
brenden bot is sad.  good work cj
that or we go steal <@UETS9HTSS>'s digiminer
Is that the one from Mekanism?
it seems you have some knowledge
however outdated it might be
the mod is now called makanica
formerly mekanism
I played a lot of modded minecraft back in college
same
i got paid to do it, too
those were the days
wait how?
off hours at an on campus tutor lab
ahhhh nice
WORDS
I only ever really played vanilla
hah
you're in for a world of hurt
also lots of cool new stuff
Hence the dying alot
dont worry, there is a mod called `Not Enough Items` that basically helps you know how to craft everything without having to look it up
I just hope to leave lots of craters where i was
well, if things haven't changed since I played, then you are going to want to make a Draconic Reactor, and then make it melt down
Will it take you with me Dakota?
<https://youtu.be/bYGPjRPhmrA?t=310>
Does that answer your question?
I need to play with non banable things dakota
But I sooooo wanna play with that now
I would actually be kinda surprised if that block was not disabled
I mean.... Brenden did say I can play with a nuclear reactor
I could probably melt that down
pretty sure they haven't disabled _anything_
also, you're not building any sort of reactor near my base
similarly, my base is likely immune to explosions due to grief protection
I think i will find a space, and place signs that say "Mad Scientist at work, enter at your own risk"
sounds good
I feel like this needs testing out
it'll take a LONG time before you're lethal enough to be worried about anyway
:slightly_smiling_face:
I mean if we get drew, that'll be 3 of us, and we
So that has a lot of mods, and I'm already confused
<https://i.imgur.com/PGo05UD.gif>
CJ that's you in the middle
Dakota and Drew on the outsides
LOL!
Yes yes it is
For the record I think upping the arms race that is Announcements is a bad idea
Ummmmm Dakota we can build space ships and space stations
Yessir!
Yessir!
I actually hate that arms race
when you open slack from okta, that channel is the first to load
and it takes forever to render all the emojis
Yessir!
I DON"T KNOW WHAT TO DO FIRST!!?!?!?!
mine
this is minecraft after all
explore
die
Sorry I don't know what I want my first objective to be
be my test subject for new spells
Make a desolate wasteland or explore the stars
soooo many spells
Yes it seems silly
punch a tree
CJ do you want to focus more on technology or magic
or both
I DON"T KNOW!!!!!!!
:this: very important question
I know the first thing I'm doing is setting up PSI
cuz those guns are amazing
PSI?
psionics?
dammit <@UDC03KCGK> why does your DEJAVU bot work EVERY DAMN TIME
honestly I think pneumatic tech is really cool
Psionics aren't guns generally?
so I can smush people?
there's a compressed air powered helmet that gives you a crazy HUD
I'm not even sure how that works
Pis is based off the anime  Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei.
where spells are cast through building spell models and using some sort of device to run the spell models through
the main character's spell casting medium looks like a couple pistols
I've seen that before
I've seen that before
I don't know the janpense names
the english name is the irregular at magic high school
CAN YOU MAKE THE NUCLEAR GUN TOO?!!?!?
probably
Na its not designed as an overpowered mod
however you can make a "rewind" spell
where your character goes back in time like 5 seconds
since that's literally the main character's signature thing, makes sense
I like it because its easy to get a gun early that makes cool unlimited point and click ranged torches
and instant break blocks
and of course the spell that flings your target 15 blocks into the air
I have one that makes enemies drunk
and one that blinds them
and one that summons iron golems
plus your typical magic missile
this seems weird
I literally had to try to install the modpack like 8 times
I literally had to try to install the modpack like 8 times
Yea it was a pain

There's also a bot that will randomly ping dakota when he posts with a little saying
Oh wow. I need to test these waters.
Sometime it pings drew too
If you know python or JS that's what they're written in
heh, don't forget the one that spoofs itself as a real person and says something posted recently

Nope, not an official holiday unless you're a student
Ahhhhh

watched the 1st-10th men's elite finish
watched 1st men's handicap finish
Nice
made 4 pizzas
mine was the best
Were they sprinting at the finish line?
LOL!
Wait who made 2 pizzas?
or who was there that does not live there?
i had people over
Ahhh got it
we as a group made 4 pizzas
mine was the best partially because I sauced the crust so it stayed moist
lol
effective!
Got to copley early (not the building i work in) and the meeting i was there for was cancelled! Great way to start the morning

i guess slash commands can activate messages??
cj try saying /stabby
eh i tried
maybe giphy counts as editing a message
no idea
are you in the log or something?
nope just guessing
speculating
guesstimating
it posts the message and it looks like it deletes the command used

I like the fact it triggered again 5 minutes later
YOU MEAN I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THEM MONDAY!
I did for RI
I'm fairly sure they were due monday unless you had an extension, not that the IRS is staffed enough to come after you right now
Nah fed and MA are due today
Other states were due monday
Ahh, I file from SC, which is always the 15th
Poor dakota, he'll get his refund 2 days earlier than normal
WHAT?!?!?!!?
Refund???
what refund
I owed 350
WHY ARE YOU IN SC???
lol
well see, you made sure there's no way they'll come after you for more than 350
I mean.. i guess?
Not like they care about my level of income anyway
I'm not in SC, my accountant that I've used for the past 10 years is in SC
So he should be happy to not have to rush yours?
dammit im gonna unfile. It is against my nature as a procrastinator to do so
lol
Is there a particular reason you continue to use an accountant in SC for MA taxes?
I feel like he would likely be unqualified
how does one aquire an accountant
Pay people money
Pay people money
Perfect Deja vu
She doesn't seem to care, they get filed when they're done, regardless of date
I still have no idea how you specifically trigger it so often
Ahhhh got it
Not only that, but no one else does
it shouldn't be possible....
As long as your particular accountant doesn't mind filing for other states, its just them filing the proper state form. So why do I need a new one?
Because they don't know how to best manipulate that state's tax law! Clearly if I'm going to the bother of hiring an accountant it's because I want to cheat the government out of as much money as I can
Ask for recommendations from friends/famile/ work. Also identify if you want them for taxes or year round. If you go for only taxes, try to find a place that charges per form and not hourl

an event is triggered every time you grabbed a new image
Yea but why is it doing that here?
I mean, having done my taxes by hand looking up random extra forms, I'd be curious how much they actually save me (besides time). Sam looked into one for this year and by the time we'd filled out all the forms for him, I might as well have put the info down in boxes myself. Then they weren't going to do expenses for her and that's when I said "Fuuuuuck that" and did it myself.

I'm just surprised such an easy problem is what we use
i don't think it is used as much or at all right now, but it is pretty good to showcase edgecase consideration and input validation
you mean like
/roll md6
/roll 6dm
lots of people will basically just call split, and assume there are 3 items int eh array, and that array[0] and array[2] are valid numbers and stuff
/roll dd5
/roll 1d3d5
/roll 100d100
/roll 100d100
what an interesting handle with the 1d3d5
yeah i didn't expect that
not sure what i expected, but it appeared to handle it pretty well
agreed
/roll 2d3d6
lol sometimes i forget this bot exists
/roll 2d6 3d3
<@UHQD9J1SL> you may not have seen this one before
so it parses anything with the d and if it doesn't have a valid input places a 1
clever
also, the emojis are split into 2 alphebetical segments
wtf
/roll 2d63d4
crazy
/roll 1d10m0
/roll 1d10m4
/roll 1d10m4
roll 1d0
/roll 1d0
/roll 1d0
/roll 1d0
/roll 100d0
/roll 100d0d0d0
/roll 100d0d0d0
Someone put thought into this bot
what just happened? did it auto react with emojis? :smile:
Yea I get 20 random emojis occasionally

Good morning CJ
Good morning Yinz!!!
Yinz?
CJ, why do you try to ruin all my fun?
Because I miss our random, YOU'RE NOT A WORK FRIEND WHY ARE YOU HERE?!?!?! chats
And I miss you!
But mostly because I don't know what funny thing I can say to you
I am in fact alive
Despite multiple lava excursions
I'm sorry for leaving OKAY?
I miss randomly running into you in the kitchens as well
And fair
You need to give me more things to work with Victoria, right now all I know is your commute sucks
You need to give me more things to work with Victoria, right now all I know is your commute sucks
What do you need? Because that's all I've got going in my life
You need to give me more things to work with Victoria, right now all I know is your commute sucks
Well that's what all of your good mornings are going to refer to
And I need whatever you want referenced in your good Morning
I'm debating if I want to make summon the silent a command that I can call for you, so you get randomly generated ominous sayings
Well I need coffee or tea to function in the morning, can you work with that and a poor commute?
Well I need coffee or tea to function in the morning, can you work with that and a poor commute?
We never answered what "Yinz" referred to
<@UHQD9J1SL> what is YINZ?!!?!
I can totally work in the fact your a zombie!
Lol it's Pittsburghese for y'all
<@UDD45P5A9> what's wrong with your commute?
It' stupid long, longer than mine but over a shorter distance
Do adults who don't run on coffee exist? Are the unicorns?
:unicorn_face:
I gave up coffee for the past 6 weeks... So yes
6 weeks??? Pansy
Gave up alcohol for the same time period though

Lazy Good morning
Summon the Silent
You're up early
Also :wave: <@UHQD9J1SL>
Also :wave: <@UDD45P5A9>
Been at work for 45 min already
WTF!?!?!?!
alright double ping i guess
Why were you here so early?
One of the teams I run is being dissolved and I need to finish some stuff up.
Ohhhhhhh
ewwwww
Good luck buddy
yeah. Higher ups decided that service phone was no longer needed and we had ~3/4 a sprint to get everything cleaned up
I'm not even sure what service phone is
I bet that fucked with your sprint completely
you know it
service phone is basically when customer call us wanting to change an order, we tried to identify teh order and issue before they started talkign
Ahhhhhh
Morning all :wave:
Why don't we just use a basic IVR, and do "Press 1 for this"
And so forth
We do, but that doesn't tell us who the customer is or which service level to route the call to
Ahhhhhh, and you were trying to make a prediction of of the number calling in
Ambitious
If we know who the customer is, and what order they are likely calling in about, we can route them directly to Agents that are trained to handle that kind of issue
but yeah, team made some great improvements, but we got to a point where we have to fight for small wins. Besides some heavy data science, I'm not sure there is much more our team could have done
Yea, that's not surprising. That would be a data sci project
<https://media.tenor.com/images/53d82b7895fc39aacd45479d2fa8a255/tenor.gif>
So they killed it all, or just development of it?
Further development. It was deemed "stable enough"
Got it! Well now you get to go work on something new
Alright, i think that was my favorite deja vu yet
Actually laughed out loud
Aysh, i don't think there's enough coffee in the world to wake  you up
probably from your spam attempt earlier
oh yeah now there are like 3 sets of the alphabet
but only a few letters could make sense
and it just HAD to pick f
WHICH IS EPIC!
only way it could have been better would have been :f:
:f:
just in case
No dice
thats for future dejavu
a 1/1000 chance
It'd be easier to go in and manually add it to the text file
decreasing daily
Truth is, I am never asleep.
Good morning everyone!!!
the text file is appened to from every message
for some reason though, the text file doesnt' update in real time
That sounds like a super power
I thought it was only deja vu triggers
A really shitty one?
Last afternoon, my power went out, i couldn't cook, all nearby department/ grocery stores / cafes were closed for Easter. It was FUN I tell you!
You're power went out? Where do you live?
Medford- station landing
Is it really that shitty though? Not having to sleep basically means days are 1/3 longer, but only for you
entire street went out
Also this is why I love natural gas
natural gas never goes out
it just explodes
I would imagine you're like 1/2 as productive which is a net loss on the day
why would you be less productive?
True, but I can still cook!
So what did you end up doing yesterday, starve?
actually it would be more than 1/3 increase inproductivity, since you will never even feel tired!
See I think you still feel tired, you just don't sleep
well thats not a super power
which means you have a full day of tired energy
thats insomnia
lol!
Given that Aysh requires coffee to function i would agrue her super power is insomnia
agreed
I drove to a 'beach' nearby and got back- power was back by then though
Appropriate
Moral of the story, it could have been worse!
it could always be worse
This is why it's a terrible idea to give me minions
Loving the deja vu bot
Sorry your team got disolved. Seems like you still have another one.
Eh, a lot of the time you're doing stuff at home that doesn't require full energy anyway. Could use more time to get through stuff
100% ALL OF THE TIME!
Ominous time for Prometheus to step in
Also I become a serial killer if you don't let me sleep
But that's because you currently require sleep.
If you didn't, then all the disadvantages of not sleeping eke away.
Like there are people who function on 2-4 hours a sleep a day and just don't require more.
Eh i'm basically on like 4 teams right now, so one less is a good thing TBH.
how I envy them
I seriously do. Meanwhile I'm finding I work better with 7.5-9 hours of sleep, so it's either short myself half an hour from most people or sleep an extra hour.
This conversation: "Good morning!"
"Your life could be even shittier, think about that."
also coffee
LOL!
eehhhhh I'm ok with being frail about sleep
:crickets:
:crickets:
it was so active this morning
it was so active this morning
Yes
:crickets:
it was so active this morning
No one sustains it expect for us
True. It's like people "have things to do"
lammmmmmeeeeeeee
Also Dakota, don't burn too many spells in our fight, I'm gonna need a heal in a bad way
I have exactly one slot remianing
so 1 heal
:lol:
Drew may have prepared one as well though
The big scary spider hurts
Yea, we'll have to get drew to heal me, WHERE'S THE SHITTY SENSU BEANS DREW?!?!?!
I did prepare a heal. Pray I don't need it myself while a big scary spider myself.
Well clearly i'm going 1v1 with it, so you shouldn't be too worried
Yeah well we don't know how many spiders there are, I have to touch the web first
_if only_ we had some senzu beans
YOU LIT THE WEB ON FIRE!!!!
Nah I rolled 23 perception, Doug said I found them all
There's not a web to touch!
but he also mentioned that it wasn't the only fight
Which is a bigger concern
Well looks like I'm preparing some shitty beans next time we take a long rest
:lol:
I would say that that doesn't sound like something a street urchen would do
then i saw that they also provide a day's worth of food
Yeah, street urchin be desperate as fuck for any food
Clearly street urchins need sensu beans because they're like free punching bags
and they last 24 hours. so you just use up your remaining spell slots before a long rest
... how is it possible that dejavu is so relevant so often
But I have to prepare them first, which since I didn't, means I can't do that till the 2nd long rest from now
Human mind makes correlations even when there isn't one
yup
I suppose
How do you only roll good when it's not that important!?!?
I feel like we're totally going to die in the next fight
Either that, or I need to let Drew tank
I mean it saved us from getting sneak attacked
also i have +6 perception i think
yeah with his op animal forms
I guess
That he never uses correctly!
Remember, he just shifted into a spider
WAIT WHAT?!!?
not really sure that a spider is the best choice when fighting with spiders
Alright, you win Deja vu is on point
And apparently I am the chosen one today
Also I would agree, i would have liked whatever spiders natural predators are
tiger?
Maybe a giant chicken
though drew's luck as a tiger has been.... questionable
Once again, because we wasn't adding his tiger power to his tiger rolls
though I think the guards did like 30+ damage to him
so theres that
AND THEN HE TAKES THE CAPTIVE TO PEOPLE WHO WILL RELEASE HIM!?!?1
Now I have to find the son of a bitch again, and torture him for the funies
Also we have to find that chick and murder her
perferable after taking her alive and torturing her too
CJ I think they should replace the definition of murderhobo with an image of your face
For the record, I wasn't trying to be a murder hobo
I tried to talk the situation down
And then I got stabbed for my efforts
:doubt:
Also I recommended not burning the spider web and pissing them off
I've been the bastion of reason here!
I find it funny that the guard capitan wasn't mean to be part of our story
Clearly Doug underestimated our vindicativeness
yeah _our_ vindictavness
Also the fact that I want my 5 gold back!
she didn't even put a scratch on me
gramatically bad, contextually perfect
I'm confused, are you implying that it's me, or that Doug expected it to be me and it's actually you and I?
<@UDC4QL95G> TELL ME THE ANSWER!!!
<@UDC4QL95G> TELL ME THE ANSWER!!!
that was a difficult sentence to parse out
Lol
when you italicized _our_ where you making fun of me, or just emphaiszing both you and I are?
*Vindiciative
Lol i was considering just leaving it at `that was a difficult sentence to parse out` to be funny, but then i got distracted and the decision was made for me
I was making fun of you, I am not vindictive as she was unable to hurt me at all
you got beat half to death so i'd be shocked if you didn't hold a grudge
I don't get why you guys asked her name, and implied you were going to kill her then!!!
Cuz we knew you wouldn't lit it lie
LOL!
Valid answer
Capitan stabby doesn't get stabbed
he does the stabbing
Now we just need to survive the spiders and some other shit
I mean she did steal 5 gold pieces from you
You could be angry about that
Deja Vu has been perfect today
Deja Vu has been perfect today
I became the spider because Doug gave you an extra spider for your perception roll, but he never confirmed that was ALL the spiders. So now I can touch one of the remaining webs that isn't on fire and find the rest of the spiders.
Deja Vu has been perfect today
assuming you dont die
assuming you dont die
Details
I truly thought the 2 of you with your heavy armor would be the tanks. I'm quickly finding out I'm going to have to act as tank going forward
<@UDDE5960N> you have internet??
You lost internet in the building?
yup
back now
That's like a Sev -1 right?
I lost connection during my 1 on 1 to google docs but that's all I can tell you
Well i need to hit level 4 so I can get +1 to my AC
and make enough money to get better armor for another AC
So I'm a little squishy right
now
Also I got ATTACK by 5 GUYS!!!!
And that spider hits like a brick truck
Yeah, I have a pretty sizeable constitution even when I'm not in Wildshape and that Spider has me basically down to 7 life before I even got a turn.
sev4
Ohhh yea, I forgot you almost died too
I have the distinct feeling we're not going to find that scout team
Good Morning <@UDBV9N1E0>!
Good Morning <@UDBV9N1E0>!
<@UDD45P5A9> did you get your coffee yet??
<@UDD45P5A9> did you get your coffee yet??
<@UETS9HTSS> SAVE US!!!!!
<@UDC03KCGK> You're bad at lighting stuff on fire, you pyromaniac!
Good Morning <@UDBV9N1E0>!
<@UDC4QL95G> Alarm means time to get up! Unless you'r
<@UDD45P5A9> did you get your coffee yet??
<@UHQD9J1SL>
Probably not.
Probably not.
I'm getting used to trying to play a character and not just what I myself want to do for fun. My character is supposedly too wise (not intelligent mind you) to think that is what he should do
This is why I made my character what I would do!
It's easier
Well I didn't know my character was going to be wise, I was going off of how I want to play. Once I figure out that part I'm all set.
I think you should just be a pryo now, since you try to light everything on fire!
I only have 2 cantrips, and I don't find myself as not an animal much. So the second cantrip is more of a backup.
so one cantrip is light shit on fire, what's the other?
Save you from what?
The spiders that drew pissed off!
I argue several of those spiders should've been damaged by the fire
YOU LIT THE WEB ON FIRE NOT THEM!
I think they would take damage for occupying the same space as the web fire
They'd need to start their turn in the burning web; moving through it wouldn't be enough
This is assuming that they don't have a racial feature preventing that, and that the webs you encountered are functionally equivalent to the 'Web' spell
But they would have been on the web
None of them started on the web, they were in the trees surrounding the web
None of them started on the web, they were in the trees surrounding the web
None of them started on the web, they were in the trees surrounding the web
What spider do you see make a web and then not hang out on said web? I've seen spiders make a web, then move to a new one, but these were just chilling in trees?'
and now I really seem like I have a split personality
Bring that up with doug
You mean you don't?
You mean you don't?
See told you Drew, you're embracing your inner pyro, and it'd be funny if you made it part of your character
See told you Drew, you're embracing your inner pyro, and it'd be funny if you made it part of your character
I'm gonna stab things, you're gonna light them on fire
See told you Drew, you're embracing your inner pyro, and it'd be funny if you made it part of your character
Can add it as a character flaw.
Sorry Ive been MIA, But here I come to detract from this conversation since I don't know who/ what you are discussing!
<#CGNP38P52|dnd>
our tuesday campaign that you're not in
But could be if you give up on dance!
I'm trying to convince drew he's a pyro because any time we're about to have an encounter he tries to light it on fire
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!?!?!!?

some people just want to see the world burn
:kill_it_with_fire:
To be king of the ashes
our tuesday campaign that you're not in
I was just at a very informative Merril Lynch session where we were told to make coffee at home and not go to starbucks everyday!
I'm trying to convince drew he's a pyro because any time we're about to have an encounter he tries to light it on fire
Yeah, and smoking is bad for your health
<https://media.tenor.com/images/5b6d23ff55b8d24593ea0994dbcad63e/tenor.gif>
I wanted the Popcorn
i did sneak popcorn back though
Also there are studies showing that I have a better quality of life if I buy Starbucks because I hate making coffee
Sooooooo
I DO WHAT I WANT!
I used to have a neighbor that would drive me to work (before I bought a car - i paid her) who would make me coffee every morning and breakfast sometimes 'because I know you skip'
AWWWWW
WHY WOULD YOU EVER GIVE THIS UP?!!?!?
I would be like yea bitch I still want rides!
she moved :cry: she chose to get married and LEAVE ME FOR HER PARTNER!
Well.... I guess YOU SHOULD HAVE TRIED HARDER TO SEDUCE HER!
she was old enough to be my mom CJ!
I'm not saying you had to marry her
she was amaze though- my parents would sit bored at home while I was at work so she would take them to show them what the 'real America' is- Olive garden and Casinos, according to her
Fancy
Too bad the real world gets in the way of us having ufn
i live for UFN!
lol
what does your name mean, CJ? :think-load:
I mean... it's my name????
Or are you asking what it stands for?
that- yes
FUCK YEA I"M A CHIEF JUSTICE NOW!
Chief Justice O'Keefe
What's the most _*IRISH*_ name you can think of
<@UDC4QL95G> can that be is deja vu name?
WORDS!
Or worse, just "Chris O'Keefe"
I don't think I know your middle name. I just know the C part.
I'm pretty sure it's one of the messages lost
Or if the J is actually a middle name at all
J is a middle name
Ah. James?
Because if remember correctly I trolled Dave hard one day about this
Oh then that is long gone
so.............what is it ?
Drew knows
Also are you in the court yard drew?
Or did doug get you?
I'm across the street in Nordstrom Rack. I'll walk over.
I'll come down and stash you in the room
Carbonara Joaquin 'O Keefe.
Carbonara Joaquin 'O Keefe.
100% correct.
So, smoke bomb or illusionary body that can cast spells to distract it
Well, the smoke bomb does have a chance of being an actual bomb
Or a "hey he's right here bomb watch him glow"@
Is that throwing the smoke bomb at the illusion?
I. Mean the bomb could potentially be exactly opposite a smoke bomb so mahbe
Yeah, I wouldn't think that trusting your deity ever to be the expected value play
Confused
MORE CONTEXT!
I think by definition of mischief, the things she gives me have to be real and useful at least some of the time
Sure, but that doesn't mean most of the time
So expected value is negative
<@UDDE5960N>, Jarem found a smoke bottle from his deity in his bag. He is not well hidden. You are. Barry sent the Ettin down the path to go thwack a dragon corpse for fun
Dakota is getting spotted, so says Doug
Oh for sure. But the potential value should be good enough for me to actually atremtp to use them
That's not how expected value works. You know statistics enough to know this.
Soooo Barry failed his diversion and the Ettin found Jarem?
Barry succeeded the diversion. I'm hanging back waiting for the screams
Good Morning <@UDBV9N1E0>
Good Morning <@UDBV9N1E0>

:smile:
good morning Caligula Jinkies 'O Keefe!
I mean Roman Emperors are cool, and apparently shaggy too
But not Irish Aysh
Perfect
I'm a huge tennis fan too which only makes it better.
pretty sure it's a criket bat
Yes, its a cricket bat. That's Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open
Ohhhh, no clue
It just seemed very fitting for your staff attack last night
Dakota asked last night and I had to confirm that, yes, I in fact committed exactly 0 points of damage the entire night.
I'm the mobile bullet shield and that's about it.
You know, let's face it, coffee as a cologne or perfume would sell really well.
That would be hell for me
I mean.... GOOD JOB FACE TANK! No one else got downed
That white robe is now ruined
That white robe is now ruined
Not if you immediately soaked it in cold water
Hmmm i suppose he IS in a shower (probably)
maybe he didn't want it to be white?
Ohh, new tie dye
lol, I think you're a little too excited for coffee tie dye
lol, I think you're a little too excited for coffee tie dye
lol, I think you're a little too excited for coffee tie dye
I'm the right amount of excited
A good government worker you are
Mehhhh no focus today
Mehhhh no focus today
Also the games club lunches makes me sad with the split
So many more, no resolutions
alright here is a puzzle for you then
How do we get here:
Sure
Do you want to do the free drink thing?
I meant the roof deck. What free drink thing
Juice Press is doing a buy one get one free between 2-4
Eh not really into drinks like that
I'm gonna with, we can't because we don't have access to that floor
How did you even find out about the outside deck?
I saw it from 9
Think thats the 4th floor?
Myabe 6th floor?
I tried 6th floor, there is just a door with a code in that direction
lol
Yea, I'm gonna say the tentant there has nice digs
And we're not allowed in
:zoidberg_sigh:
which is sad because it's gorgeous out today
I know, thats why I wanted to go chill there
that'd be a cool place to work for a bit
Don't think we'd get Wifi there
Have you tried the 222 courtyard yet?
Nope.
That seems neat to work too
I have barely been down to 3
There are some pretty neat desks to work on overlooking the church on 9 and 10
but the stools aren't very comfortable
It's not on 3, it's on 2
I wonder if that was intentional?
maybe
CALM DOWN FRIEDMAN
YEA DAVE WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!!?!?!?
Ohhhh, Dakota are you going to see avengers opening night?
nope :sadpanda:
ouch, any plans for when you're going?
nope
I will tell you all the good spoilers then
eventually is about as far as i got
are you seeing it opening night?
yea
I have a couple of friends that are comic book nerds
So they generally go opening night
RI is much more... relaxed than around here
People were saying they were booking tickets out to Saturday because they were the only ones open.  Bought tickets this morning for an RI theater
this is friday after work
i'll probably just see it then
Weird but ok!
Otherwise i'll get spoiled
Good we'll ruin it for everyone else monday
agreed.
didn't think i would be able to see it so close to release
Because you didn't buy tickets rediculously early?
yup
I wound up taking the far right seat in row D
we have lost critcal mass
Not bad
6:45PM First Friday of release
Hopefully no in and outers for you
shocked that there are any seats
Ohhhh
I'm doing 7:15 thursday
those were all sold out
you will have one day to spoil me
Nahhhh that's mean
just gotta stay off of the internet starting tomorrow
people were really good about not sharing spoilers for Infinity war though- made my faith in humanity go up
I did not experience the same thing
Welp.
though to be fair, I thought they were joking/trolling when they I saw them
lol
lol
I saw that... twice in theaters? Also something I saw opening night
Because I have no faith in humanitity
View from the desks on 10
Nice too bad your ass suffers
yup
Shoulda taken a picture of the stools
LOL!
hmmm bad impersonation choice
funny though
Nahhh that's makes it in my opinion
It's like you're talking in the 3rd person
Wish it had just left it as "Poor dakota"
True that would be pretty epic
I put that :dejavu: reaction as a debuggin tool, should I leave it or take it away?
Keep it
I like know what triggers it
Interestingly after that one day of crazy stuff, python seems to have calmed down
it hasn't been double posting or anything
probably because I haven't been playing with giphy enough
Wasn't that what we tracked the bug down too?
that is a high effort troll brenden
Not gonna lie, it's weird seeing an emoji on every line of text
so, im pretty sure I could write a script that would literally add an emoji to every message in the whole history of this channel
kinda tempted to try
_theoretically_ i would just have to run it again to turn them off

well, that sorta worked
Just block anything that says Avengers or Endgame
Or any character name
that sounds concerning
if you scroll up, there are a bunch of trollfaces that didn't remove themselves
Dakota how did you get spoiled for Infinity War? We went and saw it opening night
Also I'll have 2/3 of my screening to spoil CJ. 5pm tomorrow
Catching up on this today was...weird
you underestimate my ability to browse the internet at work. Spoilers pop up quick
you underestimate my ability to browse the internet at work. Spoilers pop up quick

Cuz of all the comments or the content
yea, the 7:15 is nice because the only way to get spoiled is to have some do it while watching the moview
yea, the 7:15 is nice because the only way to get spoiled is to have some do it while watching the moview
BOTH!
Cause today was a weird day
I liked the fact that pinned messages still exist in the Pin, but no longer exist in the actual chat
There is no context for them, they just exists forever
Which was the last film you watched without checking your phone in between?
I'm not sure I have ever checked my phone in the middle of a movie
Maybe once if i was expecting a call
Your new views are nice! Is engineering in the new building?
Your new views are nice! Is engineering in the new building?

Yeah I turn my phone off during movies. 
Though I do remember the last time I did have to check my phone during a movie. Inverse of your question Aysh
Odd how people are taking the time to emoji every comment.
People I think you mean person

I didn't get distracted when I came in this morning
SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!
SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!
lol
Don't worry we'll have those for you later tonight
I feel like after watching the movie, I'm going to combine fake and real things together just to mess with you
BLOCKED!
lol!
Can you even do that on Slack?
i never thought id be excited for this kind of content but i kinda am- yet to book tickets though
i could log out of this one?
"this kind of content"? You mean movies or super heroes or what?!!?!?
I watch movies at home mostly!!!
you could just uninstall slack
super hero movies!
yes- who cares about work and stuff
Work schmerk
lammmmmmmeeeeeee there are certain movies that need to be this big!
That's because Marvel did a great job of making real characters
Yeah, it's overrated
Work is
Evolution of Tony and Thor come to mind
DAMN STRAIGHT YOU WERE ABOUT TO GET ANGRY COMMENTS ABOUT HOW AMAZING MOVIES ARE!!!
I'm very hyped for this evening's showings.
true :slightly_smiling_face:
SO EXCITED!!!!
:person_with_pouting_face:
:hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1:
:hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2::hype-train-1::hype-train-2:
I've watched all the Marvel movies. Even the bad ones. Which some of which I've liked better than other "good ones."
Bad ones?
You mean like the first thor?
Yeah I like Thor 2 better than Thor 1. Lot of people hate Thor 2
I also really enjoy Ironman 3
I honestly don't remember it
Well yeah, it's pretty forgettable.
3 is the one where he blows them all up at the end right?
Yeah
That was good
That plot line went... nowhere
SOOOO
Not every movie has to advance the series
He fought a bad guy and cool shit happened
That's all that needs to happen
And it's hilarious
Just weird to have something be a big moment in one movie completely disregarded in the next.
You mean with pepper having super powers now?
No, cause she had those removed.
Ohhhh I didn't think they even addressed it again
Isn't that the one with the little kid?
The suits being blown up. Obviously he builds more, but the whole point was to focus on Pepper. If you're going to move past that, at least acknowledge how that happened.
And how tony realizes he was terrified?
Yeah, that's all the 3rd one
nah too weird
I like that one, there's a lot of character development in tony
Like I said, I like that movie
A lot of people don't because the Mandarin got played off as a punchline
As a movie though, it's pretty solid.
I mean, not really
?
The mandarin was always the bio guy i thought
or was that suppose to be a different villain?
The Actor Mandarin was what is in the comics.
Not Aldritch Killian.
No i get that, the actor portrayed the comic book version of him
So when he turned out to not be this mystic terrorist and was instead Killian, it rubbed a lot of people wrong.
but it's a cool bait and switch to me
Exactly
Shows that they're willing to innovate while acknowledging the origins
As for my least favorite MCU films, I don't care for the 1st Captain America movie. Don't really like the 1st Thor.
As for my least favorite MCU films, I don't care for the 1st Captain America movie. Don't really like the 1st Thor.
REALLY?!?!?!
The 1st Cap movie is soooo good!
For the 1st half
1st thor is meh
ALL OF IT!!!
Couldn't stand the montage
I'm also a WW2 junkie
As for my least favorite MCU films, I don't care for the 1st Captain America movie. Don't really like the 1st Thor.
Felt like they paced the movie super well the first half, then someone hit fast forward through a bunch of it and now he's fighting Red Skull. The end
Deja Vu needs to simmer down. Pops up a bit too frequently
4 of them for 57 is bad
<@UDC4QL95G> can we tone down Deja Vu?
It's popped up 4 times in 57 messages. Probably would be better at a 1/100 frequency
well if  only you knew how to code you could do it yourself
Yeah, well working on that
It'd done by the way
Ehhhhhh
its hard because you really want to see his genesis and why he "vanishes"
but those are going to take place a drastically different times in WW2 so you need the montage to signify we went from open shots to really the close of the war
The one that pissed me off with the fast forward is Black Panther
What fast forward in Black Panther?
Or you referring to how Civil War handled it?
Huh i cannot actually edit the files right now. something is weird
oh, now i can
also <@UDC03KCGK> the code for dejavu is pretty human readable at this point, there is a constant at the top of the file with the chance for deja_vu that you can configure using the link pinned in the megamoji channel
I put this in a group message but thought it bid repeating here. 
Someone wrote about how with GoT  and Endgame this weekend, we could watch a significant number of pop culture icons die in the space of a single weekend
My main hiccup is getting used to actually starting off with a working set up. Reading the code or playing with it will be easier to pick up when I can compile and run code in some kind of organized way.
It's extremely basic stuff that I need to get comfortable with first and the last book I used didn't give me a very good understanding for
Does anyone know if Endgame is going to have an intermission like how the Lord of the Rings films did when they were in theatres?
<!here> beware everybody, china managed to distribute a pirated copy of endgame onto the internet, meaning spoilers will be rampant. STAY OUT OF ALL COMMENT SECTIONS
(and threads that drew is a part of)
What the hell have I spoiled?
I haven't even seen it yet!
:lol: dont worry im just being a dick
I'm so up tight about spoilers. I don't understand the articles that say you enjoy a film more with spoilers. I'm under the impression it is all quoting one study that had dubious collection methods.
thats exactly why I warned about thread you are in specifically
I'm confused
Implying that you spoil movies is so blatantly false, that it would drive a reaction from you, and everybody else knows it is a joke
you fell into my plot perfectly
You got me therr
I literally got the most minor of spoilers trying to look up intermissions being a thing or not
So guess that does it, no more internet for me today!
yeah once a copy of the movie is on the internet, far far too many people have seen it not to pollute the internet with their "knowledge"
I say download jupyter notebooks personally
I'm already debating "ok, get to the movie early, then when previews start, immediately go to the bathroom" one bottle of water, and only drink when absolutely necessary.
are you seeing it tonight?
Yeah, 5pm
he's beating me by 2 hours!!!
2 HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yup. But since it is a 3 hr movie, I can't spoil it for you.
I had a friend in high school that spoiled the end of the 3rd pirates of the Caribbean movie the day I was going to see it. Still not entirely over that.
If I don't see GoT the day it releases, I'm literally off the internet for days until I correct that.
lol
I wonder if someone is devious enough to watch spoilers, then go to a theatre and shout them out in person to people about to see the movie. Has the culture fallen to that low yet?
I'm pretty sure no one does that because of the threat of physical violence they will receive
You have to remember that people that do this online, are not that brave in person drew
I'm pretty sure this has happened many times in teh past
I would google it, but i dont want endgame spoilers
GOOGLE IS FORBIDDEN ON THIS DAY OF DAYS!
I wouldn't underestimate stupidity
I can see someone doing it to people next to them, not to the whole theater
See not somebody in the theater. A punk kid leaving the move runs into a theater thats about to start, screams the spoiler and the books it
That I totally agree with
Once again, cowards
I'll agree with cowardly actions
But not stupid ones?
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZRFA0cLaM>
You mean like this?
I can see this
Yeah basically that.
once again not intentional and generally low impact
This is more being unlucky enough to hear
Or someone doing that in the theatre because they think it will be funny and not be smart enough to recognize the real physical threat of violence.
maybe? I'm more concerned about babies or small childern
See Deadpool
Gotta wear noise cancelling headphones until the show actually begins
lalalalalalalalalala
then keep then on and read everybody's lips
Oh man, small children will be tough
worse than the "friend" we made at the first avengers movie?
Oh man, that guy was too much
Got over it by the end, but damn
Was pretty funny though when we got to the end of the movie. He quieted down real quick then
You guys made a friend???
WTF was that nonsense?
There was a guy sitting next to us that was somewhat mentally handicapped (how however you are supposed to say this in a PC way) and very very excitable and very talkative.
Ahhhhhhhh
And he was sad about the end?
SPOILERS
but yeah he got real quiet
we're getting hacked by the bot
You've made it self aware dakota
You've made it self aware dakota
YOU HAVE CREATED SKYNET!
YOU HAVE CREATED SKYNET!
can i put that on my resume?
You've made it self aware dakota
YOU HAVE CREATED SKYNET!
yes, but I don't know if that helps your cause to live
Skynet would never kill its creator
:lol:
you.... test that theory
Was that a test or is there something real hidden?
I want to click it, but I'm scared!
hmmm trying to decide what i would do if I was actually capable of testing that theory
only one way to find out :devious_patrick_face:
CJ, you should click it, it's definitely *not a spoiler
clearly go to the nearest camera and beg for forgiveness and an armed robot escort
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
THAT"S SO EVIL VICTORIA!!!!
no abuse of these spoiler alerts less the gravity of them gets lost
I DIDN"T EVEN KNOW WE HAD THEM!!!
yeah that ws really just a test, but I left it when cj started panickin
I'm debating on deleting to remove tempation
ADMIN POWERS ACTIVATE!
Na more like:
If i woke up one morning thinking that I _could_ create skynet, would I do so just to see if I could?
but, they _could_ be useful
yes yes you would
probably
For the record, if you ever decide to do it
I want to be aware of it
Preferably involved
This show actually inspired me to be less wasteful as a child. Kudos.
Never watched that show as a kid
This way I know when to go doomsday prepping
Ah that explains it, it went off the air when I was 2 years old
it was before my time
...................... i feel old now
although i was in India and we got things a few years later
You missed some good shit dakota
:lol: probably
never even seen that one
And remember- reuse, reduce, recylce!
My team was shocked to learn i was only 25. not sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing
LALLALALALALAL I CANT HEAR YOU LALALLALALALA
What is skynet without a couple easter eggs
Btw that lawn mower is still running on my devbox at <http://wayfaircom.csnzoo.com/contact_us|wayfaircom.csnzoo.com/contact_us>
I think you're making Aysh feel incompetent Dakota
Na, just old
both?
I hope not.
joking about age is one thing, i don't want to actually hurt feelings though
LOL!
If it makes you feel better, when you put us all together, I doubt many people would realize the age gap between us
I was shocked at least
You seemed much older than you are
Jackass smart mouth children
where the heck did this come from
I am an incompetent old person and i couldnt care less :smile:
Aysh
SEE THAT"S THE ATTITUDE AYSH!
I can't remember, and am I older than doug?
I think so?
That conversation was a lot of fun to re-read.  i need an old person to show me around what "real america" is
I coul duse more olive garden and casinos in my life
wait... YOU MISSED THAT WHOLE CONVO!?!?!?
It was great
yeah i missed the whole thing
no chaos seed for the main thread
you could always Summon the Silent
Also did <@UHQD9J1SL> ever weigh in on being added to Chaos seed and Summon the SIlent?
maybe even an impersonation, though a 4 character name may be difficult to get a good name for
sure add me :smile:
:iseewhatyoudidthere:
what abotu now
though, i will likely have equal difficulty with that. I'll leave it up to <@UDC03KCGK>
I could always use more cheese in my life.
I was confused until I remembered that they ask if you want cheese graded on top of everything you order
Honestly have the Deja Vu bot be "Ash"
Thats what I was thinking
You read it in your head like that anyway (at least I do, please correct me if it is different <@UHQD9J1SL>)
soooooooooooo its pronounced like ice with a SHH! at the end - although Ash is a common nickname i get
So "I-shh" ?
yup!
Duly noted. Thank you!
How many syllables
Summon the Chaos SEed
just one!
really?
...
SUCH INTEREST MUCH WOW
Pedantic: it's reduce, reuse, recycle. Because you don't have to reuse something if you never needed it in the first place
i was going for descending alphabetical ordering
you can say that again
you can say that again
darn found a bug
you can say that again
you can say that again
:perfection_emperorsnewgroove:
Summon the Silent
hmm
Wooos
ah got it
Summon the SIlent
I'm proud of us, the Chaos has been on point the last week
Alright `Ash` has now joined the chaos
Which we now know is the wrong way to pronounce her nickname
Which I think is on point for Deja Vu...
I for one never attempted to pernounce it
Mostly because I know I would have, and likely still will get it wrong
Names just don't make it past my thick skull
I always ask when I meet someone in person the first time. It's important to pronounce people's names correctly
So how long you keeping Hat Kid as your profile pic Dakota? You changed it because of Dave but to my knowledge you've never played the game
I have been fully integrated.
Oh i switched it cuz I thought it would make a neat profile picture
Then it was pointed out that having a female character as my profile picutre, and a first name that is generally assumed to be female added to the chaos of this channel
Who here has actually met me :think-load:  its extra tough because none of you have your own images as your display picture
I don't believe we have met. My understanding is you know Doug, yes?
yes :slightly_smiling_face:
CJ Marla Will and Brenden as well through games club at work
Indeed. Though I don't think Dakota = girl. Kind of like Jamie. I just know a fair balance of both that I don't have a preconception. Alex or Kelly for example I would think Boy or Girl respectively while acknowledging I could be wrong.
I would take cheese grated on almost anything as well
I have not attended any lunch games in _quite_ some time, so its possible we have not met
Also D&amp;D, no?
Oui!
I can't actaully remember the last time I was at a lunch game, so it's likely we have not met
I only know you through nights dakota so yes
Sad Aysh is Sad. Will meet soonly!
I ish
Aysh
You just like the smirk don't lie
cmoraal was gone from wayfair even before I joined, so don't feel bad there
Drew left, and then games club started dying slowly without it's unofficial leader
that's not what happened :thinking_face:
Prove it!
the copley/boylston split is what killed it
Do you prefer games club nights Brenden?
prefer nights to what?
No once drew left, Games Club Nights became much quieter
oh, I wasn't in the external unless after drew left
And then look at the venn solution rate prior to Drew vs post drew
the wayfair slack one was always quiet IIRC
You do know there's a Wayfair version of this right?
Yes, but it used to have people doing stuff in it prior to drew leaving, mostly because he instigated it
Let me attempt instigation.
I attempted instigation yesterday to play TM on friday
i would have been instigated, but i have an early flight saturday
Anywhere fun?
no.
bummer
Yeah most of the people who participated in games club night are now in this slack
Anyone has summer travel planned?
I made hubot post that weekly poll, but It has not gotten like any use since drew left
going to denver on May 2nd
going to the poconos in early gune
China may 17th
I started showing up at wayfair ~10Am, so I decided that any day that i show up later than 9 i must work through lunch
might hit up san diego at some point
Jamie = Girl, Alex = Boy, Kelly = Girl, Dakota = Me
And now if he's in before 9 it's because shit hit the fan
Or I slacked off too much and need to keep up appearances
oooh nice - I'm yet to make any plans :confused: Whats happening in Poconos? And whats happening in China?
Heading to chicago next month, Gonna try to put together a camping trip over the summer in wisconson with some friends, other than that not really.
Anyone interested in a chill weekend roadtrip where we just eat food and play board games?
GoT must fuck with your head then
I would be down for that.
I would be down for that.
Meanwhile I have a graduation at Notre Dame in May, a trip to Miami end of June, and San Diego Comic Con mid July.
Nah, those are only pre-conceptions. I don't get thrown for a loop when they are proven wrong
I would be down for that.
I don't think I missed game club lunches much if ever. 
I need to instigate more game nights here but I've been been a bit too busy that DnD has taken what few nights I have had to give.
yeah we had dnd two weeks in a row
that means a game night next week though right?
lotsa fun stuff!  nice! Ill bring up the games roadtrip again sometime in May then
lotsa fun stuff!  nice! Ill bring up the games roadtrip again sometime in May then
lotsa fun stuff!  nice! Ill bring up the games roadtrip again sometime in May then
lots of chaos seed today
lots of threads today
lots of threads today
Mei and I are going to china for a week and Japan for another week
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
yes
do you usually have these at work or elsewhere?
50/50
ill join next time- hope not knowing the game prior wouldnt be an issue though!
ill join next time- hope not knowing the game prior wouldnt be an issue though!
Nah same rules as lunch expect for the 1 hour thing
If it's not a friday I cap it around 3, if it's friday we can go later
for games club night?
yea
misread
I thought you said we cap night to 1 hour
yeah CJ needs to make a train by 9 or something
that would be terrible!
so we can't go too long
8:30
we've done other days when he's not around where we play longer games like terraforming mars
which you'll hear me mention a lot because I just got an organizer for it and WANT TO PLAY
Maybe Sunday evening?
I could do that; D&amp;D ends around 5pm
I don't think mei ever answered if I was busy friday night....
you never got back to me at least
Agreed because I have to clear things with the munchkin because I have a bad habit of double booking myself
I can't do Sunday but I can definitely do Tuesday
Cj and mei is down for food and boardgames

Endgame: I enjoyed it. That's all I'll say
Anyone here not watch Game of Thrones? Or does but isn't caught up to last week's episode?
I dont watch it but Ive seen enough memes to laugh when I have to
Ok, then let's see how this works.
Spoilertastic GoT pre-Sunday discussion
Silence Chaos Seed
Do not summon the silent?
Anyway, place your bets, who makes it out of Sunday alive???
fyi i watch but haven't seen this season so keeping to threads is best
Hence the thread I made and silenced Chaos Seed on :slightly_smiling_face:
It's elective!
And yet, I have the power of summon the silent!
That would be assholish
lol
I also have not seen any episodes this season
Well, looks like no one in this channel is up to date then
No anything
Oh god I need to wear headphones all day
people are talking about the movie
WAIT!!!
I was not spoiled though
IF ANYONE IS GOING TO SPOIL YOU I WANT IT TO BE ME!!!!
People give away more then they think when they are trying to be subtle
so its a headphones day
Yeah, definitely headphones day
Like, CJ and I are talking about it in a DM
Guy on my team was like "did you see the thanos easter egg on google? Just google Thanos" and i'm like.... not a chance
Because literally saying anything is a spoiler other than "I enjoyed it"
Or "I did not enjoy it"
Just don't take the headphones off for anything
yeah pretty much
I kinda wanna just mess with people
Most notably dakota
dont do it
I'll mute this channel
Awwwww ok
wait...
???
LOL
GOTM
YOU BASTARD!
dammit now my coworkers are looking at me like im an ididot
gotta stop laughing out loud
Cause you are!
nothing like kicking a slack admin out of the channel
LOL!
Also Dakota, be wary of the internet, there are evil trolls on the loose
And they are correct
oh that was the case yesterday
and i think wednesday as well
True, but I'm just telling you
the chinese fucked up and released a copy to the internet
They ain't messing around
Having seen it and looked for them to confirm
Yeah. considering just going home and sleeping until the movie
Viable strategy
Just like camping
#RvB
I feel like the theater is going to be the most dangerous part for you dakota
Make sure to bring headphones to it
Seriously! People walk out of their screening and just talk about it
so, show up late, with headphones, eyes closed, blindfolded
gotet
To be fair, I walked up Brookline Ave talking about the movie to Sam on the phone when Infinity War came out. I was an asshole
I tried not to do it
I tried not to do it
Dakota when are you going again? 6?
Dakota when are you going again? 6?
yeah i think my move is at 6:45
yeah i think my move is at 6:45
5 more hours
Headphones go!
I am getting literally no work done
New bot idea: throws up spoiler boxes on messages based on a box of keywords
For this entire slack not just this channel
i'll be a little janky, but it could work
Now you have project for when you can't do work but want to stay "busy"
it would delete the message, then replace it with a spoiler, however the original "author" of the message will become me
That's low tech enough to work for the time being
If it adds a tag of like "-Drew" or "-CJ"
I could make it work for each person, but you would all need to give me your slack user tokens
That's dangerous isn't it? The power you wield with that
yup. with yours specifically, i could do anything
admin/deadmin etc
I'll be fine with the signature but still posted as you
:lol:
Though you're probably at the point where I would make you co-owner of the slack. I just haven't seen anything come up where you were limited by not being one
only thing I cannot do is demote CJ
will deja vu pull messages out of possibly spoiler filled threads and post here?
uhhh yeah
spoiler threads probably cannot exist in this channel
good catch
Oh, oops
Can we get a deactivate deja Vu recording for a thread? Same as silence chaos seed?
Can we get a deactivate deja Vu recording for a thread? Same as silence chaos seed?
Can we get a deactivate deja Vu recording for a thread? Same as silence chaos seed?
Nope
I mean maybe, but not currently
I would have to rework how some of the code works
<@UDC03KCGK> say something
Blarg blarg
ayy it worked
nice spoiler btw
lol
That's kinda impressive dakota
I mean he asked for it
and I was just bored enough to do it
It's quite impressive
I agree
man that thing works quick
So I didn't have any words to add a spoilers, so instead I just made everything drew says outside a thread get spoiler'd
nice
No more drew talking
/ban stabby
wait, does <@UHQD9J1SL> know about `/unown` `/megamoji` and `/ban`
no
/megamoji WOW :a_blob_hyper_party:
/unown wow
/ban wow
Everyone dies
I can work with this for the time being
I would probably just spoiler tag anything to do with Avengers or GoT
"Game of Thrones"
"Endgame"
"Captain"
"America"
"Groot"
"Black Widow"
Etc
DON'T LOOK AT THE SPOILER!
Huh no what
uh ok
No point of a spoiler tag without being able to post spoilers
lol
I have power over your normal posts as no one else is brave enough to enter
IN THE LAND OF THE BLIND THE MAN WITH ONE EYE IS KING!
This is true
I can go mad with this spoiler power
I'm very tempted to start posting spoilers vs non spoilers in a random order now.
Cast chaos and dount across the channel
I think you don't realize THAT I AM THE ONE WITH THE POWER!
This one is ok
Indeed.
DO NOT READ THIS UNTIL AFTER ENDGAME!
I'm doing gods work here
I'm supposed to be the evil troll....
Hey, you're given a spoiler warning and then click on it, that's on you. Right?
I'm so confused, but I have no choice but to obey
If I have something important to say, I'll thread it.
Cant afford to be spoiled
It's legit a spoiler
Drew is basically abusing the power you gave him by mixing in spoilers and non spoilers
Lol do be careful though, if you are actively watching the channel, we will likely catch the original message before it is deleted
I am being a bro and leting you know
lol i deleted it just in case
It's the best kind of chaos
did he use the spoiler command or did he type it out and have it auto-spoilered
There's a command???
yeah
`/spoiler`
Did you build it? Or did we always have this?
It does!
Pretty sure it's always available
I think there is too much power here
yes yes im here hello reporting for duty!
:salute:
lol
<https://media.tenor.com/images/1c77d009aa25eb32bf442ed9dfe4965e/tenor.gif>
NO ABUSE OF THE SPOILER COMMAND PLEASE
Drew becomes drunk with power a little too easily
Why?
Then you don't have to click into it
im just gonna have prometheus start deleting all of drews messages
:lol:
Wow
the power abuse in here
im afraid to click in any threads or spoilers
too bad the ban command is only for words and not people
yeah i dont know if these are facetious or serious
neither do i
I also cant write bots since I need the logs for debugging, and the logs contain the messages
Most are facetious although there was one that was serious and deleted
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU DAKOTA!!!
wait, that means it is also in dejavu
One second
cj, go find the spoilers in teh text file and remove them
I'll go get it
I thought you fixed that!
No i said it would require work
It is called chaos monkey
Legit spoiler!
Do not click into the spoilers
Seriously, Brenden's is real
Nevermind I killed it
that was intented to troll
I did not see the movie
Uh oh
and made up a fake spoiler that turned out to be real
Alright this is getting dangerous. I'll be back after the movei
Spoiler removed
From Dejavu
<@UDC03KCGK> I AM TURNING OFF THE SPOILER BOT, YOU ARE WELCOME TO TURN IT BACK ON OR MAKE CJ DO IT BUT IM OUT
Yes I'm going through and deleting things
it is now off
Surprising how quick I succumbed to the dark side. Last Jedi shit quick
:kbye:
FYI
using the spoiler command does not end up in deja vu
Bye, enjoy Endgame!
I like the fact that Brenden started in too
Added code to do that? Or it just automatically works like that?
Am I still auto deleted?
Nope, it is in fact off
You may now resume normal business in chaos monkey.
Just automatically works
Probably because spoiler command does not post a message which is what gets copied into Deja vu
Makes sense to me. I'm assuming you purged the spoiler bot messages though since those did post before they were deleted and replaced.
<https://media.tenor.com/images/b121a9ae201479d9579dcb5138236458/tenor.gif>
This is why I like watching opening night
I have no fear
Dakota turned it off
<https://media.tenor.com/images/18134abb5c90162b08eb661c10813141/tenor.gif>
He showed me where to turn it back on if you wanted it
He turned deja Vu off?
No, the auto spoiler
I had to go through and manual purge deja vu's logs THANKS DREW!
Yeah, so did you Purge the deja Vu log of the legit spoilers
yes
no more legit spoilers that I saw
Oh good! Can't see the thread on mobile where Dakota was responding to Aysh's concerns about that
Well, I saw first hand how come trolls get off on spoiling things for people. Even with it behind a spoiler tag it was just funny the amount of on brand chaos it injected into the channel.
It would have been less fun without CJ to play the hero policing the comments.
there is still a chance tha Deja vu triggers with one of those though. The text file that contains the dejavu logs does not always seem up-to-date
though at this point it is _supposedly_ a 1/2000 chance of posing any given message
though by murphy's law, it is more like a 1/4
Still, I'll be sure to delete it if I see it
I already found and killed them dakota
Got it after about 76
From now on , if we test dejavu, spam threads with something funny so that dejavu doesnt' get polluted with one character selections
I think I made prometheus delete any message of drews
You think I have 100 messages of creativity all at once???
You know, for the sake of it
What the hell
Where did this come from???
Uh
Oh yea
It works
can you thread me?
Damnit!
No!
nope
Alright you can talk again
#slackEvent.killuser()
Was not expecting that
Dakota, that's in server.py
yeah, i kinda made it really easy to delete messages
You expect me to have 100 messages of creativity?
so you can turn him off if you want
Or just random blargs?
Eh just a single copy-pasted message
Yes, you made the code very intuitive
something like:
WELL FUCK THAT
WELL FUCK THAT
WELL FUCK THAT
WELL FUCK THAT
WELL FUCK THAT
WELL FUCK THAT
WELL FUCK THAT
WELL FUCK THAT
WELL FUCK THAT
I'm on mobile though!
It was pretty great
Sucks that we legit spoiled him though
it look like
```
if slackEvent.isFrom('drew'):
```
Also I feel like Deja Vu is tricking you less now than when it was clearing the log every time it triggered
oh...
dejavu has been making too much sense
Which is funny when it does fit in
yea I'm lazy
You should know this
Play with fire you get burned
Any time we add a bot to this slack it legit makes my day
Because the scenarios that occur are just so random, chaotic and funny!
you spoiled Brenden? :disappointed:
I'm not worried about it
ah ok
no, I spoiled me
wasted concern. sheesh.
still my favorite
I made up a spoiler, trolling
but it was correct
oh.
wait, why did you name it killUser, if it is clearly just killDrew
cause I can be less lazy and add functionality to it
fixed
lol
` #slackEvent.killuser('drew')`
i see
now you can kill ANYBODY
hmmm i should clean up the spoiler function
killuser:
lol way to test your code outside the test channels

Uhhhh too lazy to come over during the day
Also today is crazy busy for some unknown reason
everything is on fire in compintel

OHHHHHH Story time?
deploy is a shitshow, gitlab changes make it basically unusable
server maintenance/upgrades over the weekend
our production crawling uses a third party black box that we don't have access to the connection string for SQL server
so it can't reference an availability group
instead we have it hard-coded to reference the primary node
with the upgrade over the weekend, the secondary became the primary
our service login didn't have the correct write access on the secondary node, and so was failing to start our scheduled web scraping bots
wow
Sounds like today is an absolute shit show for all of the technical people
YEA FOR NOT BEING INVOLVED!
of course I was criticals lead for this :eye_roll_blob:
first time I ran out of ideas for how to solve a critical though
Because the answer is easy
Roll back the upgrade
:boom:
that would be a much longer term solution as I don't think reverting the upgrade would be easy to coordinate
I would imagine bitching at someone to give permission on the secondary node would be easiest
nope, that would actually break things
And then kick shit off manually, but I'm guessing you're smart so there's a reason
it's one way replication from primary to secondary
secondary is read only
huh that was a really well timed emoji explosion
Who was the dumbass who switched the nodes?
it's standard procedure
AG?
availability group
to minimize downtime, you upgrade the secondary first and make it the primary
Ahhhhh, but shouldn't the nodes have same permissions if you're going for high availability
this is the first upgrade/maintenance since they made it an AG
I think that's the problem more than anything
Yea, someone thought they do the same thing, they don't
the failover from primary to secondary will make it so that the secondary isn't read-only
this wasn't a failover
Can you trip a fail over to make that happen?
this is resolved already
I updated the hard-coded references
Ahhhh yea!!!
Not good, but doable
but it'll happen next month at the next upgrade
And every upgrade afterwards
If it's the same AG why don't they just make it same permissions?
yep, so basically we need to include this as a step of the upgrade/maintenance process
there's actually also a third node I haven't mentioned
it's just not relevant to the current conversation
seems fucked up
But I can see this happening super easy
<@UDDE5960N> are we climbing today?
I have a change of clothes, where do you change?
All I need to change is my shirt, which I'll do in the bathroom at the gym
bathrooms are single person, large, and have showers if that matters
Ok, do you want to meet at copley and go together?
I need to stop by my apartment to grab my shoes and a shirt before going
meeting at copley works
alternately we could take the orange line, right?
Lets meet at your place then, because that's a good mid disteance
Fuck if I know
Mei know's better than to let me out of her sight in boston
Whoops
sorry for the notification
if anyone wants to come climbing, let me know
I want you to all know, so you might come with us!
So I'm not sorry!
we're thinking about going on mondays and thursdays
whats the place called?
I think it's Central Rock Gym
Damn some of those walls look nuts
central rock gym - boston*
there are many locations that come with the membership
waltham, watertown, cambridge, worcester, boston, framingham, randolph, providence, etc.
I personally like Waltham, Watertown, Cambridge, and Boston
the walls that look nuts are probably Watertown
Anybody golf? There is a golf tournament that I am looking for buddies to go with on June 14th.
I do. Not in a while so I don't promise to be very good
I do. Not in a while so I don't promise to be very good
Yeah, don't worry I am not that good either but I always have a good time
Plus this golf tournament is for a charity
So about that jerky....
how much do you want?
in ounces
Bout 6
Can't pick it up today but can come by tomorrow
there's a 6.1 oz bag set aside for you; comes to $9.76
Sounds good, I'll let you know when I'm headed toward Wayfair. Will be mid afternoon
Never golfed in my life

Went to a driving range once, and had a real hard time hitting the damn ball
I was... bad....
Fun fact, Endgame has made more money than Captain Marvel, AS OF TODAY
Well that's cuz Endgame &gt;&gt;&gt; Captain Marvel
I just think it's funny that in 3 days, Endgame sold more than Captain Marvel's full run
what about compared to infinity war
Dunno, on the movie Reddit they had this week in movies and Marvel is still in theaters, so they had the cum cap marvel vs cum endgame
<https://reddit.app.link/fBOmEYP3hW>
but... the article you linked has the stats for infinity war...
you troll
```For real though that is the biggest opening ever, beating the $257.6M domestic and $640.5 worldwide opening records set by Avengers: Infinity War just last year.```
dakota X_X
I mean... I guess
its not that hard to hit the ball :stuck_out_tongue:
but it's only for the 3 day weekend
it made 2b overall...
also in that article
``` (Infinity War is a close fourth with $2.04B). ```
you troll
yeah idunno why golf specifically gave me so much trouble.
Ehhhh you say this like I understand what you want
I find it funny people have to compare it to Captain Marvel when this is true for over 50% of the MCU films
????
Well the article was comparing it to recent films that did well
Well the article was comparing it to recent films that did well
and Captain Marvel falls pretty squarely into that category
I mean according to the article the 1st and 2nd highest grossing film of the weekend were Endgame and Captain Marvel.... So it's hard not to compare them

How does it handle threads?
What the hell happened that the bot responded for you so perfectly?
Dakota built a function that replaces everything I say with my bot
I then went in and made it 50/50 odds
it doesn't handle giphy's well so that'll always look like me
Less intrusive than the spoilers replacement
If you say so
You say this, but I don't believe you
I mean I'm all for it because it adds to the chaose
Eh if you ignore slack freaking out a bit as it scrambles to delete and replace the text. Other than that It seems to have worked pretty well
Oh it is extremely chaotic already.
Yes, as long as you're not directly watching it works just fine
Well except it counts as a new message to a thread double
So it affects my notifications
EXTRA NOTIFICATIONS!!!!
Oh that's kinda funny
Good morning CJ/Dakota
I appreciate your thought process after realizing everything you were typing got replaced
Follwed by this perfect followup from drew

I just want deploy to work again
Deploy is still down!?!?!?
git is still down
its total bullshit
Ohhhh..... I would imagine the whole engineering department is on fire right now
Wait I thought that would be fun because you can't literally do anything Dakota
it's like when the dev boxes go down
No im annoyed cuz I can do anything except actually push my code to prod
meaning I have no excuse to not _work_
When devboxes go down, its basically impossible to work since you cannot test any code you write
Meetings are always a great excuse
those start in ~1 hr
Got it, you can test to your little heart's desire, but you can't implement anything
is the WayThrifty thing normal?
is the WayThrifty thing normal?
WTF are you talking about?
WTF are you talking about?
oh- check email
no
That's new
and..... slightly concerning
i wonder who thought it would be a good idea
people who are responsible for how we spend money without being able to give us budgets
wait, what's new about it?
or is the concern that they "had a reason to send it out"
Both, it's also how you go down the path of budgets
Yes I know Prometheus!
Budgets can be great for personal finances. They can be great for certain projects, especially outsourced contracts. 
They fucking suck for how to organize a company
And yet it's the only way to control spending
Congrats cj on being the first Recognized Nifty Thrifty! I decided in the sprit of being thrifty, I include 0 wayfair dollars with the recognititon
LOL!
(i didn't really, but sorely tempted)
Budgets are great, with 2 caveats
I assume they work for the intended purpose because they come in, never leave, and most companies feel the need to implement them as they scale
1) not hitting budget isn't bad and should be celebrated, over/under spend with back up is great
2) my budget this year should not determine my budget next
Yeah, those caveats can make them great. 
That never happens though
I've seen people view under budget as good as a culture, but then change next year's budget to be smaller because they underspent the year prior.
Also you have to find a way to make sure people give accurate forecasts, else you run into divisions over budgeting to have extra cash for their department they don't need so they always "look good."
wait cj did you turn off bot replacement, or have you gotten lucky
oh i see. ALSO DAMMIT CJ FOLLOW NAMING CONVENTIONS
LOL!
I was getting annoyed that I was getting spammed on my own threads
But that's the thing if you build it right, you'll have a group that's always "YEA WE DID MORE WITH LESS" but also a group that "LOOK WE FOUND ALL THESE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES!" and they'll probably balance out
Good Prometheus, good
what is waythrifty?
Apparently the people in accounting have created "Waythifty" to try and convince us to spend our money better
IMO it's a terrible idea
IMO it's a terrible idea
being frugal is fine
What budgets or waythrifty?
but I don't need you throwing cringeworthy catch phrases at me
also apparently using pod outing money on wayfair branded merch is okay
that's what I got out of that email
yeah except we are still partnered with that sketchy as hell site
we already did that with POD money for wayday so I knew about it
And pod money is really anything to drive moral, so....
<@UDL020K8D> <@UDC4QL95G> <@UDDE5960N> thoughts on this card?
Doug isn't in this channel fyi
he was informed
There is a lot happening on that card
Earth tag synergies, Titanium cost, cheap acrd over all, end game points, and potentially amazing income
are we going with society implications or strictly TM implications?
I'm talking TM
I agree it seems powerful
it's a kickstarter reward
I am super tempted to back that kickstarter (unless it ended)
I already did
I don't think 14 is low cost dakota
I backed for a copy of all expansions
Ohhh I couldn't find the kickstarter page
its pretty cheap, especially for a space+earth card
earth is usually cheap
space varies somewhat widely
I think the only downside is that you have to be going pretty deep on science to use this
I think science tag cards tend to be a bit under-valued since you build the mostly for the high cost amazing energy production or the end game 1st place
And I struggled to really get the science part
science already has some pretty powerful cards
so this kinda balances that
Really? I didn't think so
I think 5 science is doable if you're really building for it.  7 is very hard no matter what.
I had 8 in my last game
science have some amazing cards, but most of them require high amounts of science
it didn't seem that difficult to get
certainly it's later game though
the lower cost science cards are pretty easy to come by, but a lot of their utility is the fact that they have a science tag
hm, ok. so still there, 2 points, +6 money, for 14. good rate.
I feel like science is strictly a fly wheel, the more you have the more you want
nah, once I hit like 5 or 6, they didn't feel great to build
if this card also had  a science tag, then that would push it over the edge
I can churn the deck a bit more?
I get a -1 discount on all cards?
it's already late game, so the expense might not be worth it
but as is i think it is strong, but not a card to plan to make a build around
fair
it feels like a card that will be hate drafted
or started with
or first round drafted
No, but it might enable a science based strategy similar to Brenden's titanium the last time we played
That is a card i'd certainly hold in my hand for a good long time
I'd probably buy it turn one and look for a science build
Hate drafted yes, but I feel like you'd want to make sure you can get science going before committing to it
it also has the earth tag which has 2 cards with "gain income equal to the number of earth tags you have"
I'd buy it for 3 regardless
2 points, an earth tag, and a possible science income?
please
only if you have more than 2, other wise it's an economy drag
yeah the 2 points make it worth keeping until you have 2+ science
true
but I could build it near the end for the 2 points
True enough
it's cheap for a 2 victory point card
by the end of the game, a 14 cost 2 point card is not bad at all
and by that time you _may_ get your money back or have an abundance of titanium
For end game, sure.  It's why I might not hold onto it
Because I can probably do something better with my beginning turns than hold onto end game cards
Can doug still see this thread?
yeah he can
I didn't realize that, neat
I think it would be worth throwing away if you couldn't use titanium to pay
Ehhhh titanium and science strategy sounds expensive.....
Science has cards that generate titanium
If that's the case sure....? I don't know the deck well enough to think of how it synergizes perfectly
<@UDC03KCGK> THE CARRINGTON SPOKE AND I GOT CONFUSED!!!
Where?
puppy pics
they were talking about bringing dogs to the brunswick office
Hahaha, oh man, he has no idea
some of these promo cards are interesting
ask him to change his profile pic
I need to play this game way more to have balance thoughts
I need to play this game way more to have balance thoughts
Although the law suit one is funny if it's -1 VP to the bad person
yeah pay 5 to seal 2 and they go down a point
But is it worth it to pay 3 to screw over that one player
Depends. Losing 2 coins could hurt a lot if you have your whole turn planned out
long run, maybe not, but losing money early is awful
Yeah, much more of an early game play
3 points for -1
you were just talking about how 7 credits for a point was good
Seem's like a fun screw you in the end game too
what happened to wayfair merch being from wayfair?
also be lucky you guys have a budget for pod money, we don't
There's wayfair merch from wayfair for anniversaries, but you can also buy random stuff now with your own money
In my experience few companies have Pod money, so i'm actually more surprised that wayfair has it

<@UHQD9J1SL>
I snagged a building away from Doug in the last round and stole the win
I always know how to back the winner
Yeah I came last but only by 1/2 a point. Really didn't have much a strategy in the first round.
Yeah I came last but only by 1/2 a point. Really didn't have much a strategy in the first round.
Dakota didn't seem like he was winning until the very end
half a point out of how many points?
Also I feel like that's how dakota gets you, surprise winning in the last round
:okay:
Whoops
I'll just be over here, not being tagged
<@UETS9HTSS> I didn't have anything witty to say to you! YOU HAVE OUT WITTED ME!!!
OHHHH I KNOW!!!
How was the other :dnd: group, do they make you sigh like we do?
Also it's another wayfair group right?
I got a new pencil cup today. Today is a good day.
I feel like you're very easy to please
Damnit!
Good morning!
At least you weren't forgotten like Brenden
yeah, but they weren't able to meet this week
Ahhhhhh
Seriously. I crushed him in Concordia though when he tried to mount a comeback
so I found out that my flight ticket only includes a 'personal item' that fits in a 9" x 10" x 17" box
damn you united :shakes_fist:
I think so too. 
Here Ayshu: :flower:
United fucking sucks!
I don't fly with them anymore because their basic economy is so stingy. Might as well fly Spirit at that point
my round-trip ticket to denver was only around $125-$130, so it's still worth it
but still, quite annoying
Were there just the 3 of you or did you find a 4th last night? <@UDDE5960N>  <@UDC4QL95G>
Yeah, well if you need a bag, it'll be $190 immediately
isn't it $30 for the first one?
$60 for international flights?
$60 for basic economy tickets
I was looking at them to get to Oregon
That's not what I was shown when I tried to check in
Hey, I can only hope you're right!
either way, I'm trying to sneak by with my everyday carry pack that's like an inch too wide
I did not go I just stalked the other channel
I've yet to see the airline that actually has the time to measure and sweat that kind of thing
<@UDC03KCGK> :smile: thank you :smile:
<@UDBV9N1E0>
well they don't allow you to check in online, you must go to a person at the desk if you're not checking in baggage
<@UDDE5960N> just as easy to displease :poliwrath:
:are_you_kidding_me:
so they might be looking for _just_ that
ouch
they usually have that box out front so they don't measure it exactly it's more like if it doesn't fit it goes in the hold
Seriously? So if you check a bag you can skip the counter? That's bizarre but I get it
I might be able to stuff it in the box up front
It will be mostly clothing
Soooo what you're telling me is that you're highly volatile
:voltorb:
:chaos:
:pikadab:
Well i have nothing to make fun of you now so..... all done!
I think American's basic economy gives you the carry on still, but you're in the last boarding group so it'll probably get gate checked 90% of the time
Delta also has a decent basic economy
SouthWest :heart:
Frontier does not, but who the hell besides <@UDC4QL95G> even uses them
Southwest is wonderful, just not as cheap to go with as they used to be. At least for me because I'm flying across the country most of the time.
I'm very price sensitive
Literally I'm going to denver because the flights happened to be cheap
Though it does help that I have a friend there
I'm not nearly that price sensitive I'd rather than a smooth flight than a cheap flight
I'm almost as price sensitive as Brenden. Haven't stooped to flying Spirit yet, but I would if the situation worked out to be the best value.
Oh I'll fly spirit
I have flied spirit
I go through options like "well I don't get a carry on, but is it cheaper than a normal flight if I have to take the bag?"
you just need a bag like my backpack that counts as a 'personal item'
Have either you flown Ryan Air yet?
nope
Well you're also not 6'2" Brenden. Leg room is already pretty limited
I like having both a carry on and a personal item
ahh
that's very fair
lol
HAHAHAHA TALL PEOPLE SUFFER!
And have irrational fears of ceiling fans and door ways!
I legit stood up in Verona at an old Roman ruins and gave myself a minor concussion
Sam's got some pictures of us at the USS Constitution and she fits fine while I'm legit walking like an ostrich
When you type in malicious glee, you just get the show glee
BUT I"M FEELING IT!
What the hell? Can a bot post to the main channel from a post in a thread?
That's the giphy/Prometheus issue
Where if you look at giphy's then Prometheus decides to freak out
How's that work? I don't see any giphy posts
Or is it late responding to your om nom nom post???
<https://games-club-external.slack.com/archives/CDR5ZBTT7/p1556718330242000>
I was looking for a giphy for malicious Glee and gave up when all I got was Glee the show
So you don't see anything even though I'm pinging the system repeatedly
And Prometheus reacts tot hat
<@UETS9HTSS> what were the cute dragons that made Dakota trip balls and become blind?
faerie dragons
Thank you
they're chaotic good like fey
but dragons that have magic
and tiny
they can burp drugs basicallyt
I'm gonna go with both me and my character don't know these things
Soooo what you're telling me is that we need to try and capture one these so we do things
Got it
they make awesome pets/companions
and love pranks and such
they can make illusions at will
hence turning into bread
Well this is going on the list of things to ask Doug about
Super weird
Yeah it was a good effort though. My style lateley has been low profile lots of points
Yeah it was a good effort though. My style lateley has been low profile lots of points
I usually wind up surprising myself as well
this thread got pretty random
Frontier?? is that ain arline?
I just fly literally whatever is cheapest
Usually thats united basic economy,
No it was just three of us
there is no string cheese in my kitchen's refrigerator.
And you're shocked why?
:chaos:
:chaos:
And you're shocked why?
And be sad Aysh, be sad
And you're shocked why?
yeah but there were tiny bags of celery sticks, like how mommy used to pack snacks for us in school. so I am still happy :haha: \
:noo:
but is there hummus
praise be to hummus :praisethesun:
Turns out with 3 people, the person who goes first in the fourth round is the person with the fewest buildings
We do have hummus in the new building
Yes there is hummus!
uhhhh what?
@dnd_adventures I made updates to our notes
wait... slack HAS GROUPS BUILT IN
Not for free
I already looked
oh
so I made my own group functionality
because Prometheus
I have done nothing productive today at work, either messing with our notes or Prometheus
I should probably do something to show for today
nah
nah
just make sure nobody asks you what you did today
Does making fun of my analysts and poking holes count as work?
Does making fun of my analysts and poking holes count as work?
I mean as long as the hours are between 9:00AM and 5:00PM you are working
no matter what you are doing
lol
that's good because i tend to be here between the hours of 8:30am and 5:30pm
Huh, but going first is such a disadvantage!
Huh, but going first is such a disadvantage!
I didn't say you had to be here
you get paid simply to exist during those hours
Huh? not at all
Frontier is an airline mostly routed through Chicago
oh lol. I only ever fly American and United
So if I fall over dead I don't get paid? Bum deal
Depends on when wayfair finds out
you may get paid while dead as long as wayfair doesnt' know
In Glass Road? I thought going first meant it was easy for people to jump on whatever you play.
Whereas number 3 or 4 can take advantage of people already having jumped and can play that card fearlessly later in the round for both effects.
not really. All three players must pick a card to lay down at the same time
True, but if I'm player 3 and I played the same card as player 1, and player 2 jumps on player 1's card, player 3 gets both effects when they reveal their card
I mean yeah, but that's an edge case
and I'd arguethe ability to be guaranteed to be first to build a building outweighs the chance that player one and three happened to play the same card AND player to had it in their hand
In a 4 player game, I suppose the chance of that happening is higher, so being player 4 may come with an increased chance of playing both actions
but player 4 doesn't exist in a 3 player game so the point is moot
Fair enough, makes sense that in the 4th round going first is more powerful
yea..... I feel like you'll get found out sooner or later here
Yeah unlike liberty where you can take a day off by working from home, and putting a roll of quarters on the w key and it'll show you as active on Skype all day
yea this thing where we have to be physically somewhere with nothing to do is terrible!
It needs to be more socially acceptable for me to be lazy!
Depends on high a perfermer you are when you are not being lazy. If you can get 2 days of work done in a day, and you slack off every other day, you will likey not be caught
Yes he did Dakota
Appropriate time for Prometheus
Yes he did Dakota
I mean Wayfair is easy compared to CVS where they basically asked for the moon
I'm pretty sure prometheus is semi-sentient. He is contextually relevant far to often
So no matter how high performing you were, you never made it
Yes he did Dakota
Is he ML backed?
Well ask for the moon, then what you wind up with is still pretty ambitious
sorry its not about BEING high performing, it more about seeming comparatively high performant
Valid
Also everyone burnt out and leaving
Something something outrun you not the bear
Hence why I'm at wayfair now
Lets be real Drew, if it came down to that I'm just gonna trip you
and leisurely walk away
You sabotage your co-workers?
you should probably keep running after you trip him
Or is the analogy just breaking down?
I think once you mentioned Bear it got literal
LOL!
this is no longer a metaphor
dammit stop making sense
Although one can say by leaving I tripped my co-workers and made their lives suck more?
Well it just changed from being a metaphor so suddenly that I suddenly had an image of CJ breaking coworkers computers or literally tripping them down stairs for advancement!
That's different. That's them outrunning a bear and you taking yourself as a valid target to benchmark against
nah leaving doesn't count. Thats more like running from the bear and then you suddenly wink out of existence
By flying away or some shit
Effective...? But high likely hood of being caught
Sure the people you were running with are more screwed, but its not like you tripped them
Got to make it look like an accident
Passive sabotage vs. active
Or you simulataneously tripped all of them and let the bear decide who it eats first.
Even then, I like my strategy of making everyone come to me
And then it just makes sense to put me in charge because I'm already running
Is it sabatoge to remove yourself from an unpleasant situation?
Or I leave
I don't care
You've completely lost the narrative
What if it wasn't a bear
I don't think so, that's why I did it!
Like a glorious tiger that can't tackle?
and gets the guards set upon us
It might be self sabotage that they put too much on one person who they didn't plan contingencies for their departure
One would say inevitable departure
I think you're missing that my manipulation is putting people under my thrall rather than causing them to fail
Sooo I get 2ME for any adjacency?
not bad
I still like the idea of the insurance agency one better
though I would be shocked if that player didn't get screwed in the end
Sure, but that's unrelated to your original comment that you were gonna trip me which was in response to my comment about summarizing Dakota's comment about comparitive performance
which was in response to CJs comment about asking for the moon
you can say that again
Yea
nice delete <@UETS9HTSS>
I feel like there's too many incidents, unless you hate drafted them
So you get 10 MC if you place a tile surrounded by opponent tiles?
yes
Sorry 12
but the _best_ way to place tiles next to opponents is by placing trees
clearly we're bad at metaphors
and if you place a tree next to a city, you are likely giving them points
Well this got freaky
This is somehow your fault
and I'm blaming you for it
nope cj posted it
I mean you get the credit if they place them selves against your trees too
Nope still blaming drew
true, but they still get points
agreed
Valid
it also does not work with oceans
ewwww lame
oceans are ownerless
Cities score for each tree surrounding them. No trees, zero points. Don't trees only score for themselves?
you cannot place cities next to cities, meaning if you are placing a tree down, and it is ajacent to an enemy, it means you are placing next to an opponents tree, special marker, or city
This is coming up a little too often for some reason
yeah i know
So if you could place trees next to tress
Best strategy, and then place city
But you have to grow your forest right? you can't go all willy nilly?
yeah you must grow off of a tile you own
It's down to 1/100
:woah:
Yeah, but your best play is to place a city next to their trees
yeah but the likely hood of being able to place your city next to more of one of their trees seems kinda low
sneak attacks all day long?
what?
Dropping surprise cities next to forests
Sneak attack!
How the hell can constructing an entire city on Mars be considered a sneak attack
I mean you don't know i'm about to build a city
soooooo.... SNEAK ATTACK!
I mean I guess
I wonder how many emojis I have stopped from coming into existence due to the hubot job notifying the emoji channel of all new emojis daily
probably alot
Well not everybody who creates emojis are in the emoji channel
That's why i was saying you killed a lot of emoji's
but, if you are not in the emoji channel, how will you know that your creation is now tracekd?
ummmm
Stalker style?
Rip workplace services
why is wayfair rebranding everything
Corporate America Dakota corporate America
Also if you're a big wig how do you say you did anything without rebranding it first?
Good morning <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
Good morning <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
I'll be nice and not @mention anyone
JESUS WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT THAT HOUR?!?!?
JESUS WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT THAT HOUR?!?!?
Right... flying....
<@UETS9HTSS> hope you had a safe flight to mile high!
<@UDC4QL95G> Wakey wakey Eggs and bacy!
<@UDBV9N1E0> remember when playing with dakota you gotta take him out at the knees
<@UDD45P5A9> safe travels this morning
<@UDC03KCGK>
<@UHQD9J1SL>
I watched end game last evening, finally
good morning!
I wonder if there's anyone who hasn't seen it that reads this channel now?
I haven't seen it, but I plan on reading all the spoilers this weekend anyways
WHY?!?!?!
Staying off the internet is too hard and won't be able to see it for a few weeks
Awwwwwwww
:disappointed:
I don't mind spoilers if I choose to ruin the surprise for myself, I also want to see if it's as predictable as I'm thinking it'll be
doubtful
It took me for a ride
I guess I'll see when I read the plot later
I feel like this is very fitting
Yea I tried to not be that guy
Such a good movie though!
NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE TO TALK TO ABOUT IT!
Very very fitting
Very very fitting
Just landed
Thank you sir
Just landed
I'm telling you it knows
I'm telling you it knows
So what are people doing today?
So what are people doing today?

Question for the group: I'm assuming we get back to the base in our next session
And heal up
I'm assuming we'll go buy stuff
But I really wanna kill that chick before we leave the district, so.... What should we do?
I'm partial to setting part of the district on fire and go looking for her
idunno man, killing a captain of the guard probably isn't the _best_ idae
idunno man, killing a captain of the guard probably isn't the _best_ idae
we should also try to figure out how the hell we can leave the city
cuz i'm pretty sure we are in an open world and need to do _something_
She's not necessarily a captain of the guard, that's why I was saying we need to kill her next round so we can leave
Also we leave via the tram system
we just need to figure out where we go next
Today's emoji uploads were pretty interesting
Ohhhhh?
Ohhhhh?
Also who says we have to do anything???
Doug said I can be what I want, and maybe I want to be the worlds best murder hobo!!!!
But that captain is super strong compared to us at the moment.
Nahhhhh, that was suppose to be a winnable 4 PC encounter
We fucked up because it' was 2.5 PCs
I think we had gone all in rather than run we might have been able to do something
So after our little forest adventure she should be easy peasy
PEOPLE ARE SOOO DUMB!!!!!
PEOPLE ARE SOOO DUMB!!!!!
I'm in a "new manager" program and they put us in groups
and people can't figure out that the "group" you're in is in the to line
So they're saying their missing emails
:facepalm:
i be bored
i be bored
I was super bored yesterday, today though I am trying to catch up on all the things I was supposed to do yesterday and ill not want to be doing tomorrow
i walked to 4 kitchens looking for cheese. 8 fridges opened fruitlessly.
Wow that sucks...
And poor Dakota
Accurate. I am quite cheese shaped.
10th floor kitchen in boyl has cheese
Pretty sure all of boyl does
Test

WTF are you doing?
Because clearly you don't want to do it
pushing crap through code review
ewwwww
are you doing the review or trying to get reviewed?
Though as long as what I am doing is technically work I should be doing, I am easily distracted
get reviewed
nahhhhh
Most of the time you're pretty focused
Na, just really good at context switching
lol
0 attention spaan
Probably somewhere on teh ADD scale
Probably
<@UDC4QL95G> Good morning!

Thanks! It's my day off!
Thanks! It's my day off!
Not awake enough for all the gifs
So "jif" or "giiph"
in what world is `giiph` not not pernounced like `G - EYE - F`
next time, just use `jif` or `gif`
I don't know, "jif" is a way to spell the "soft g" version.
If I'm spelling the "hard g" version as "gif" I'm basically influencing the conversation to say "hey, you fuckers are wrong btw"
there is no "version" here. Its like somebody walking up to you and saying they went to the petting zoo to pet `joats`
you would look at that person like they are retarded
So in other words, you pronounce it "gif" instead of "jif"?
why would gif be pernounced jif
Wait...you've never heard that this is a debate on the internet at all???
I have seen plenty of this debate on the internet
I was just trying to think of a new reason why it wouldn't be pernounced with a hard G
So this woman has subjected herself to this alarm clock? Because she looks confused as hell when she shuts it off, but she's also able to identify how to shut it off basically immediately
in fact, the only argument I have seen for using a soft g is `the creater used a soft g`
whereas there are plenty of examples of why it would be pernounced otherwise
Which is dumb. The creator is not a linguist and language changes
The person you are before you sleep is a very different person from the person you are when you wake up
This girl is known for making machines that aren't necessary, like her robot to fee her cereal
id like a robot that stops me from eating cereal
It may actually have that side effect
lol
Ohhh Dakota, I confirmed with doug that I still have the helmet
the mind control one?
I think we should kidnap someone and put it on them and see if we can talk to other guy again
yes
THE GUARD CAPITAN
grapple her and put the helmet on
Alright I know what I want to do next session
I also feel like we need to make connection to the root team too
Yeah, root team would be good. Maybe they are affable to druids
Yeah, root team would be good. Maybe they are affable to druids
Any fun weekend plans?
Any fun weekend plans?
Not to my knowledge probably planning things
alright giphy works for me now
Conceal, Dont feel!
is that the same song?
i only saw that movie once
I like how she lets her hair down, but doesn't undo the braid as part of it
Like in a "can't go full wild yet!"
i mean you probably cant just casually rip your hair out of a braid
Also the braid goes through the shoulder instead of around/on top
SO IT DOES!
I knew about the animation error, but damn does it have to be slowed down a ridiculous amount to clearly see it. Some people just have an eye for these things
some people also just have a lot of time on their hand and nothing better to drew
Wrong "too" which really changes the meaning of your sentence.
na I substituted "do" for "drew" as if I was calling you out
backfired thoug
saw a chance for a play on words, no actual reason to call you out
My motivation to work is quickly dropping to 0
Which is generally all you need
I am already there my friend
Already there
Wanna play a game of pool or something?
I'm terrible whats your skill level?
terrible
Ok I'll come up
:lol:
I'll go set up the table.
Oh no somebody beat us there
who wants to learn about the Pixar theory!
i guess no one
I already know it, sorry. Also Frozen isn't Pixar
Sorry was playing pool. What pixar theories
Sorry was playing pool. What pixar theories
its a theory that all pixar movies exist in the same universe on one complicated timeline
I have heard of this
I have not, but I also have a hard time telling what _is_ a pixar movie, and what is not
since all those animated moves are the same to me
blasphemy!
<@UDC03KCGK> you need to get on our plan of capturing the bastion captain and putting the mind control helmet on her.  After which we kill her (maybe torture first to find out where our money is)
Dakota is not smart
Although we're 1 for 1 in pool, although I think he out scored me by a lot
<@UDC03KCGK> you need to get on our plan of capturing the bastion captain and putting the mind control helmet on her.  After which we kill her (maybe torture first to find out where our money is)
The first game yea, the second game was more even, and i got luck with the triple sink for the iwn
All that's saying is you're going to have to outline for dakota what pixar movies are
Eh I could just google a list
ok now im aware
do I have to count cars?
I suppose it makes sense with toy story... but i was not a fan of those movies
.were they too old school for you :stuck_out_tongue:
lol
Na, The Incredibles was my Jam (one year before cars). I just didn't like cars
I was surprised that they kept going with the series. Were they actually popular?
yes
The first one was pretty funny
But's mostly because of the tow truck
looking at this chart, cars is comparatively bad
cars 2 was very bad
Inside out and coco are the best
oh and Up
OHHHH Humor me
Would you like some Updog?
seeee cars isn't terrible
also i feel like cars merch is the bomb
Never saw Coco
I was a big fan of incredibles 2 though
never saw finding dory either
Felt kinda weird going to see a pixar movie by myself
Incredilbes 2 was awesome
You can bring me Dakota
:lol: i couldn't pass that one up.
I think I getting distracted and saw it on netfilx
But I love me some pixar
I had low expectations going into brave and was pleasantly surprised
I have not seen it
and it makes me sad
It was one of my favorites
coco deserved to be watched :disappointed:
Don't know what to tell you, it's not on netflix
eh just google. Watch Brave Online and then click around until you find a sketchy place to watch
As long as you are smart enough to not download anything you will be fine
too much effort
:open_mouth:
<@UDC03KCGK> i need a bot idea.
im bored
Do you need to stay at work any longer?
yeah, cj and I are playing a game after work
...
i dont even
That was amazing
you are welcome to join us if you are able to get to coply or my place in an hour or so
I'd have to leave by 8
So does cj for his train
would work out pretty perfectly
So does the deja vu emoji pop up to be the message that triggered deja vu bot? Or signals that it is the message that was brought back to life from the log?
Games:
```Race for the Galaxy
Tiny Epic Galaxies
Sushi Go
Azul
Decrypto
Blood rage
Smash Ultimate
Overcooked```
it signals what message triggered the deja vu
there is no reaction on the source of the message
I'd be down for Azul, Castles of Burgundy, Overcooked or Race
I'm assuming your place then?
Yeah, those are ones i own, and I assume you prefer my place over copley
There was no response from teh game club
I do prefer that, if only because half those games I'd like to play aren't easy available at Copley
that too. Copley we get a few more games, but lose a couple as well. I dont think our collection has expanded all that much since you left
Starting time Preference?
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDC03KCGK>
Meeting till 4:30
I'd say 5 then. Means I can leave now and get there right on time
Plus CJ can leave straight from his meeting with you
Sure. CJ let me know when you are ready to go.
I don't think it takes us a half hour does it Dakota?
Trip form boyl added an extra 5 minutes, so it can take up to 25 depending on walk speed
Kk
and if you want some cider/sake, i got none in teh apartment so we will have to stop at that shop on boyl.
<@UDC03KCGK> do you want us to actually pick someting up for you this time?
with a good chance of looking for something for you, getting confused, and walking out?
We need to stop for booze, any place with sake?
Nah, I have a beer from last night's shift
Brenden's favorite shop is only slightly out of the way
just one street north and we will walk right by it
I think you got good sake there
Ok
We will also go by Dirty Water and Shake Shack if you want food
but thats getting into the "high effort" territory
Nah
Headed downtown
:byeeeee:
Lobby?
550?
yeah, you heading down?
yea, stopping at the bathroom
Got off at Hynes. Where you two?
Got off at Hynes. Where you two?
<@UDDE5960N>  make your train?
<@UDDE5960N>  make your train?
He's on his way still. You won by 6 pts
You got a shit ton of point from what specifically?
I'll take the win, but it feels as messy as when you will Terraforming Mars because I didn't hate draft that card. Except in reverse and in both scenarios I was too situationally unaware of how to make the optimal play on my own.
Made the train
The double God cafd
How use was it
Ehhhh, that's a game I enjoy but requires a lot more planning than I was prepared for
How close were you to missing it
Pinging <@UDC03KCGK> to make sure you're on board
I had 3 whole minutes
Also I think it showed up a 1 minute late
But the food smelled delicious, and it was hard to focus
The double god card? That's what I had. What did <@UDC4QL95G>  have?
We should test the mind control helmet on someone else first.

Then see about putting it on the captain
So seriously, I just want to know the various ways Dakota scored to come within 6. I knew he had a lot of different god track points, but I didn't know much else.
I picked up a bunch of buildings worth a good amount of points, and went up on several god tracks at the end. I was one under you on the gold track
I had no other end game points
Did you pick up those building on the final turn? I am just fascinated by what your final turn was and I didn't get to see it. It feels like a fluke that I won.

Well by grabbing that building I was going for you made me miss out on a much larger amount of points, you also snuck above me on the gold track reducing a further 6 points of end game scoring
Good Morning <@UDBV9N1E0>!
Good Morning <@UDBV9N1E0>!
Safe flight home <@UETS9HTSS>?
<@UDC03KCGK> Your building strategy sucks
<@UDC4QL95G> be early today so you don't have to be early tomorrow!
<@UDD45P5A9> be wary of the sneezing people!
<@UHQD9J1SL>
good morning! :slightly_smiling_face: happy Monday~!!!!
There is no such thing as happy monday
there are cheddar sticks in the refrigerator!
Is that good or bad? I know having cheese is good, but I don't know the significance of cheddar
..............was that you CJ ?
..............was that you CJ ?
Well, play another round then and tell me the better strategy. I'll go building
Yes, he has a boy replace every other thing he says with the exact same thing but spoken by his bot
Good morning!
You know for chaos
Mornin' :wave:
I'm back in Boston
Coffee is a thing
Not in my world it isn't
Well, except when it's in beer
Then it's a thing
Coffee beer is a thing. At noon
Coffee beer is a thing. At noon
at noon?
You're right, we can be more aggressive than that. 10:30
Whats worse, waking up at 10:30 and drinking, or be drinking from the night previous and relize that its 10:30
Whats worse, waking up at 10:30 and drinking, or be drinking from the night previous and relize that its 10:30
the latter is definitely worse
I have no qualms about morning/afternoon drinking if the occasion is right
in fact, opening breweries is great; you get a lot of face-time with the staff/brewers
lol
lol
:fancy:
:fancy:
These random profile pics really throw me for a loop
Hello people who have lived here longer than I
Hello people who have lived here longer than I
Hi Aysh
I realize today that I have been here 7 months
I am yet to find a favorite cafe- favorite neighborhood to shop for dram homes- favorite drive.
May I learn vicariously from you all
I'm a guys, no use here
guys dont like driving?
I mean I really like my Mazda 3
But I also like driving stick
As to my scenic drive, I don't have one
no dream house, no cafe
I don't own a car :disappointed:
what do you do when you have nothing to do?
hell, I don't even hae a massachusets license
this is a problem i have been trying to solve for 2 years in boston
Vidya games!
Torture other people!\
my car lease ends in october and im not renewing- its just a money pit for me
Same with the driving. As for cafe, there's chains that are pretty decent (Nero &amp; Tatte), I have go to locations
i pinged 4 different groups of people on 3 different messaging apps on saturday to make some plans- un-fruitful
As for neighborhoods, you gotta know what you want to know which is best
What seems to be the boston norm is visitng bars/breweries/museums is what people do for fun.
I mean I do live an hour south of the city
i just want to see it all :disappointed:  no preferences
Sooooo..... I tend to drive down to RI alot
do you not like doing that?
WE GOT NO LOVE!!! NO LOVE!!!!!!
If you like the outdoors, NH/VT are pretty awesome
ill hit you up for more specifics
its summer- i want to be outdoors, issal
Newport is gorgeous, block island, cape cod, martha's vineyard
I mean summer is an awesome time of year
I was thinking about looking into zipcar and other rental subscriptions to figure out how far they would let me drive.
and then just driving places on the weekends
at the very least i should probably go to new york
the look on people's face when they find out that I have never been is kinda funny though
:open_mouth:
thats my face rn
:facepalm:
i think im gonna go to new york just to eat- smorgasburg is my happy place
For the record, personal recommendation is Amtrak
reommnd things to do in the evening after work
A little pricey, but super consistent and convient
yeah I have heard Antrak is the way to go
Hang out with us?
Hang out with us?
i didnt know you hung out :shrug:
There's a station stop in southern RI that's stupid cheap, and free parking.  The only sad part is having to deal with people already having boarded
I mean we really only set something up ~1 per week
Mostly because we're bad at planning and there's so few of us
I guess we will just have to start hanging out then
i think i need personal tour guide to show me around - where can i find those
yes lettuce!
It's too bad you don't drink
We will make CJ and Mei show us around
Rock climb with me!
i was gonna say, there's these things called Bars, and they have guys.  And they'll pay to have _you_ keep them company
Mei will make you eat food
So I hope you like asian food
i like food.
CJ be our tour guide!
<@UETS9HTSS> what makes you think im capable of that?
Can you climb a ladder?
I assume you can, so you can rock climb
I'm talking about indoor climbing by the way
i just realized that on April 25th I complained to someone that I have no time to do anything and my time isn't my own. Now I am  complaining I have nothing to do. Someone- diagnose me :smile:
When it comes to rock climbing, are there walls that either allow self Belay or dont require a Belay
I rock climb, look for food/drink related events/festivals
ohhhhhhhhhhh CJ Mei please give a walking  tour of best places to get asian food in Boston :open_mouth:
play D&amp;D
try new food places
go to breweries
play some video games
I like the stuff that involves food :smile:
Clearly you dont understand how mei works
This will be an eating and shopping tour\
works for me
That sounds like a lot of fun
Where you have dishes at each location and shop digestion so you can go eat more
I feel like you'll be spending time in Allston and Chinatown
possibly H-Mart
this sounds like heaven
whyre you saying it like its a bad thing
who?
Yea, we tried to recruit you into shennaigans, and you said you had dance!
CJ :smile:
I do not enjoy shopping
I enjoy shopping for food
And a day of eating and shopping seems like a waste
life is a compromise. 50% good is good enough
It's not shopping for food, it's window shopping on your way to get more food
I mean depends on if the alternative is better :lol:
:oh:
yeah, not a fan of window shopping
Other things to do: go dancing at Havanna Club, do one of the escape the rooms around the city, Boda Borg, archery tag, go to an Improv show at Improv Boston, Shakespeare in the park, Roaring 20's lawn party in Ipswich, Rockport and its beaches, modern art museum, isabella Stewart Gardner museum (must see at least once), MFA, kayak down the Charles
NYC trips are literally, go to this place for breakfast, go here to stare at pretty things, go here and get snack...
kayaking is a good warm weather one
I think I am going to get a kayak season pass. Huge fan of kayaking
there are groupons for a season pass for the summer
get one and you get unlimited kayak rentals
I may be doing that this year
that might become my thursday after work activity
<@UDC03KCGK> noted all of those- thanks!!!
I feel like Aysh can be summarized into, I want to eat more food.  I'm not really bored
:smile:
I wanna do boda borg that sounds fun
Its actually more of
a) try all the things
b) be lazy and give up
c) suffer acute FOMO
d) Profit????
Of course! Boston is a very difficult city to find fun things to do in if you don't drink, so I try to keep in mind all the things that don't require it
you havn't done boda borg???
np
even *I* have done boda borg
Game night at Boda Borg!
np
boda borg is great :100:
I wish they swapped the rooms more.. I think I have solved pretty much every non-physical rome
????
Then time to do all the physical ones
have you done both access rooms?
(denied/granted)
First time i went we failed the second room, last time I was there the room was broken
Oh btw <@UHQD9J1SL> A4Cade is a fun arcade mixed with a Roxy's so even though it is a "bar" you can actually have a really great time there on a Saturday afternoon without drinking at all
that second room was amazing
I find that I give up less when I have a routine, especially if not sticking to it will inconvenience someone else
Im gonna do everything youve suggested Drew
<https://www.groupon.com/biz/woburn-ma/dave-and-busters>
<https://www.groupon.com/deals/dave-busters-braintree-all-day-gaming-package>
True, but for that I need some recruits for the 'someone else' part
RE: arcade
Im actively trying to do things by myself now though
huh didn't know there was a D&amp;B around here
woburn and braintree
Providence has one that's walking distance from the train station
the groupon doesn't cover ticket games, but it does cover everything else
ok for real- that tour ....
It'll probably have to wait till June
have you explored Portland, ME yet?
the train is something like $25 to get there
Because I'm out of country next week till June
better for a weekend day trip than after work though
i have yet to!
I think Aysh is trying to recruit us, so she doesn't have to go alone
:hmm:
<https://games-club-external.slack.com/archives/CDR5ZBTT7/p1557160828496800>
Yes, but I take that as she does not want to continue that course of action
Ill set a reminder. I am not kidding.
why can i not have both
why can i not have it all
AM I NOT WORTHY???????
:whynotboth:
That's fine, I figure this will be an all day affair and that'll work better on the weekends
you are not worthy, accept it
:burn:
perhaps- but I will try my hardest!
Also, perhaps if you have a lot of time, you could look into fostering a dog? That's something I've always wanted to do, but my current housing situation doesn't allow pets
I WANT A PUPPY!!!!!!
I dont have consistent time, also more importantly, im a little afraid of dogs :stuck_out_tongue:
Best way to get over your fear is to play with them?
my biggest fear is earthquakes.
There's like a reading program for children to read to dogs in shelters
Blahhhhhhh
Give me a Shepard!
Thanks! I appreciate!
I'm a Husky or Samoyed person
Ehhhh, it gets a little too hot around here for them.  I feel like keeping them cool is a struggle
having a dog though makes it so you basically cannot leave for any significant amount of time
BUT UNCONDITIONAL LOVE DAKOTA!!!!!
UNCONDITIONAL!!!!!!
I mean yeah, but they are hella inconvenient
yea... it's the only reason I don't have one yet....
I'm not a huge fan of dogs though
PUPPY!!!!!
hence 'fostering' the dog
it's temporary
You say that like I could give it back
That's not my problem :laughing:
Mei is ok with taking you on her food tour of boston
Mei is ok with taking you on her food tour of boston
And she doesn't drink, so you don't have to worry about that part
Im so grateful :duck_grateful2:
:wat:
But... how
.......
That's freaky
was that made on the panini press?
if so, that's some next level thinking
microwave for 1 minute, drain the fat, wil harden in 3 seconds :smile:
1 minute :wat:
:wat_intensifies:
:internalscreaming:
:internal-screaming-intensifies:
no cheese deserves that fate
Ummmmmm.... that's.... scary.....
but have you HAD a cheddar crisp?
For some reason I was under the impression that a cheese stick would catch on fire in the microwave
No
kinda like apple slices
yes, but from a grill/press/oven, not a microwave
Cheese and I are on the outs
its crisp umami goodness
Just googled umami and it got real sciency real quick
it's just another type of flavor like sweet or bitter
```a category of taste in food (besides sweet, sour, salt, and bitter), corresponding to the flavor of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate.```
just a lesser known one
it appears in some beers too
i wonder if any desserts have umami flavors
anyway!
wtf is a glutamates?
monosodium glutamate = MSG
does that help?
Soooo how much Chinese food like it tastes?
:stroke:
Cause that's literally what comes to mind for me!
MSG is only a portion of what take-out american chinese food tastes like
Y'all are having a way more technical conversation about cheese than I thought even this channel could have.
<@UDDE5960N> do you plan on getting a membership at CRG Boston?
<@UDC03KCGK> when do you want me to guest pass you at CRG Boston?
Mondays are what work for you, yeah?
and usually thursdays, but not this thursday
Yeah, well it'll have to be the week after next then. I'm gone 15th-20th, and I'll probably have to work Monday to cover for the days I won't be there later in the week
you are welcome!
Maybe, my primary concern is my Frodo feet don't fit well, which means I need to go buy shoes too.  Any recomendations for shoes?

Seems like they should be going in the opposite direction
getting smaller and smaller

why exactly was Bill Murray in that movie?
Because he is Bill Murray
Clearly. It's reached new heights
Who else would have been in it? It's a role written for Bill Murray
Or lows
Technically speaking that is a "height"

Or a "low"

Height implies up, depth implies down
So no!!!
<@UETS9HTSS> dont expense lunch- be WayThrifty!
<@UETS9HTSS> dont expense lunch- be WayThrifty!
EXPENSE ALL OF THE LUNCHES!
WTF is going on over there?
Also, how terrible is that? I get don't expense a super expensive lunch and take advantage of it. However, if the company owes you lunch, don't pay for it on your dollar because the company is trying to guilt you into it.
THey explicitly stated you cannot expense lunch with newhires
THey explicitly stated you cannot expense lunch with newhires
Fuck new hires
Fools for joining us!
OH MAN THERE'
Brenden mentioned somewhere that he's taking a new hire out to lunch and i was stalking him
I just saw that
And the way thrifty emjoi
we didn't expense it
that's on thursday or friday
:waythrifty:
i didnt see the emoji
it was a self originated thought
i take credit for it
That's shitty
yessir
For the new hire and the manager
Yeah, totally didn't see that anywhere but that's ok
well its funny cuz I have 3 newhires on the team, two of wich are very recent, and they didn't get lunches at all. we just went to fooda :lol:
Well, Fooda is shitty. So my statement stands
Its quiet
Yes
today is busy :disappointed:
*K*
:angry:
What are you doing?
tiding time between meetings
lol
That's always the worse just enough time to get bored
Not enough time to actually get something to do

is it possible to write a bot that limits visibility of messages?
so every 20th message isn't visible to one person
:chaos:
Sweet, not as dumb as I look some days
Don't think so, I don't know of a way to "hide" messages in slack
Theoretically you can delete the message and send it as a DM, but not very valuable
not at all unfortunately
yeah i don't think that's possible
<@UDC03KCGK> I SAW YOUR MESSAGE IN <#CGNP38P52|dnd> !!!
<@UDDE5960N> have you left yet?
<@UDC4QL95G> no analyst caught me

nah, once im awake im awake, its just the getting out of bed part i struggle with
Boring is almost never a blessing
Agreed
you want just enough to keep you going
Depends on how much you like your job as well. If you aren't fond of your job, and you are kept really busy, you wont really notice how much not fun you are having
if you arent fond of your job but still have the job it means you need the job
if you arent fond of your job but still have the job it means you need the job
or you know it could be worse
Or you're afraid of change
or lazy
Today is like ADD day
Today is like ADD day
I don't know what to do with myself if I'm not answering someone's direct inquiry
wayfair's really goin downhill
I saw that
People are very sad
```Engineering is going to help us replace the Clooney/Gosling images in Org Browser for new hires to be more inclusive.```
directly from the ticket
That came from an equality thing WayOut was pushing as apparently it's 2019 and assigning people Male celebrities as their photo is wrong
oh no they have a slack channel... I really want to see if there is drama in there cuz that would be entertaining, but if everybody gets along there then i will probably be scarred for life
So, I always thought the just Clooney's and Goslings, even for female coworkers, was strange. However, I would think they would just find 2 female actresses, like Hathaway and Amy Poehler
I'm of the opinion that people took a meme too seriously
No I can't write it as just "Poehler" because I literally had to come up with her name by going "Tiny Fey and ..."
but I don't really care that much
.............................................. this came form a joke, not from tryign to be inclusive
I thought it was a funny bit of Wayfair culture
why does everything need to be  ruined
could you elaborate?
as in, it was never meant to be representative.
From what I've seen, it is just Wayfair trying to "grow up" and be more a part of the corporate game. Which sucks, it doesn't seem to serve any real positive purpose.
ahh, yeah; exactly
maybe just go back to the money pictures then
Storytime? What money pictures? How long have you been at Wayfair???
*monkey- sorry :smile:
<https://kb.wayfair.com/kbnode/legend-george-clooney>
not very long, but i asked for the history and learned this
Drew, you can't add female actors, because what about non-binary people, or trans people? They need representation too...
I don't necessarily agree with the argument but I was present for it
The whole Clooney thing started as an April fools joke, then one Gosling got added for flair later
No drew that would not be being inclusive. In that case we would HAVE to remove them. if everybody gets cloony, then its a joke and they have no right to care
it was...
for the non-wayfairans
Were you part of the team that was making WayOut?
As for the non-binary people, look, I'm not saying this solution is perfect, it would just be a step in the right direction. If you want to say there should be non-binary people as an option, great, you can add those in, but it means people have to then be willing to identify as such openly.
Which if they don't want to, is their perogative. However, if you're going to uproot this meant to be non-serious tradition over it...that just feels like it is taking it all way too seriously.
NEXT
I was a member of wayout, which is why I was present for the conversation, but I was not part of the ticket
I agree that the members behind the ticket were taking a joke meant for fun too seriously
Like great, now everyone is a lamp or a couch
I don't want to be a couch, makes me feel fat
There are 10 different photos that show the diversity in products that wayfair sells
But same, I wouldn't want to be any furniture, rather just have a blank spot for an image
I don't know, this feels like when people argue for making something safer when there hasn't been a history of accidents.
Make this more inclusive when there hasn't been any complaints.
Unless there has been.
Hey, I actually enjoyed reading that whole thing
There had been some, some in the wayout community felt offended by the photos, but I'd say less than 1% of all wayfair had any opinion on them let alone were offended
Ah yes, the monkeys
So bring back the chimps then
Also, funny that Mark isn't at wayfair either, seems like everyone involved with the original Clooney thing are gone
That's what new hires are afterall essentially. Chimps playing sports
I don't know then. Where do you draw the line on these things? I'm totally fine with respecting people wanting to be called "They" or "them" or changing genders, or identifying as not part of a gender. That's their business, and I really don't care what bathroom they want to use. I think getting upset about what people want to do like that is intolerant and worrying about other people's business.
Then you get to jokes like this and it becomes, well, when do you respect someone's feelings, and when is it just a joke being taken too seriously? I don't know these lines.
I honestly have no opinion in the matter, just relaying the opinions of the people behind the decision
Actually Mark is back
Oh and not saying you had one! These are honest questions, "Where do you draw the line?" and "When is this a joke being taken too seriously?"
Since when? Last I heard he was at CarGurus
naa sports have gender baises
I think he has been back for quite some time
I agree those are good questions, just ones I can't answer, either personally or the voice for wayout in this conversation
i think you and drew were still working here when he returned,  maybe even chris
What? Chimps playing tennis is gender biased?
Or Soccer?
naaa chimps have gender baises
Huh. One of the reasons I looked at CarGurus for a job was because LinkedIn had him there
according to org browser it looks like he returned `12/04/17`
Mark has been at Wayfair since I started
:lol: they made a lamp emoji and its called :notcloony:
well, that's an alias of it
well yeah but it should have been the original
Ohh, nope thinking of someone else who left wayfair
:eggplamp: is the orignal
:lol: well mark did leave for a while
Lets start a movement
everybody needs to chance their slack photo to cloony
I mean, I would, but don't have wayfair slack
this is gold
this is gold
Yeah, totally would if I had Wayfair slack myself
Yeah, totally would if I had Wayfair slack myself
Everyone will be offended by something
Everyone will be offended by something
Why should you value the opinion of the LGBT+ community over the crazy homophobic community?
Who's arguments get more weight?
In this case it's clear, we should be more inclusive
But a great example is White Male scholarships are met harshly but black or female scholarships are encouraged
Today was exhausting
Do you actually not know why that is the case?
I lack motivation currently
and so I'm quite exhausted
It's like that weird phenomenon where the less you do sometimes the more tired you are as a result
The scholarship thing or the who should we listen to more?
I have D&amp;D after work, and I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to it
Today was like meetings with half hour breaks and people asking questions for the limited time i was at my desk
It's that kind of day
:disappointed:
The scholarship one
It's because the argument is made that white males are at a natural advantage compared to the other oppressed groups
Bascially
Which i would argue is bullshit, because it means that poor white males deserve no mercy because they're are more rich white males than any other group
If you want race to not matter, stop making it about race.  Make it about class
I used to argue it was bullshit too, because I came from a small town with a bunch of friends who were basically in poverty.
Black students under perform because Black students make up a vast majority of the poor
That's not really the point though. The point is if it is a significant variable when all other things are held constant. Which it is.
It's cause vs. effect
If you only ever address the symptom, you only ever make the problem worse
<https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations>
Maybe. The problem with just dropping race in the discussion is that it isn't a level playing field. We're trying to say "Ok everyone's equal now" without realizing how people got a short stick for the first however many generations the game was played.
So even if we target just the economic aspect, people still game that to help the poor white student OVER the poor black one
Ehhhhhh, now you're saying we're still racists against blacks
Where as a scholarship to go to just "white male" doesn't actually target a problem. It's exclusionary simply to be exclusionary.
Yeah, have you not seen how the last few years have been playing out?\
I mean if you want to go with that argument sure
And who's racists against blacks?
What is the commonality of this power block?
American, usually white, usually rural. Some rich. Some Republican, some democrat. Many old.
I disagree with the old
I think it's relatively spread across age, maybe centralized in old, but different generation different morals
Have you not seen half the crap being posted by the radical right?
Or people having to form groups like BLM because of disproportionate police brutality?
For the record, you not addressing my point
The only part i disagreed with was old
I'm still responding to your comment on "saying we're still racist against blacks"
Which you then started asking questions like you're socrates about it.
No
I have a point
Then go ahead
Which is I would add, Poorly educated, and fiscally poor
The leadership is not
If you want to go down that route
The leadership is not...racist?
Leadership is not poorly educated and fiscally poor
But they are use the masses of easily manipulated people to drive racism
Yes and ?
So, this goes back to the rich are using racism as a weapon to oppress both groups
How, because people are disenfranchised, and no one wants be the bottom
Why because if the disenfranchised are fighting each other, there's no one to stop them
I'll grant you that's a serious problem. That doesn't change the fact that there's still a heavy racism problem in this country
Or the world.
Going back to the start of this, you're saying socioeconomic is more important. Which I don't think you are wrong about it, and I understand what you are saying about symptom vs cause.
However, in the case of why is a "White male" scholarship looked down upon, but a Black or Female one is not, it comes down to the "White male" one, is not solving a problem.
White male was never historically oppressed or causing a perpetuated problem to be undone. If you want to include White males, you make it open to everyone.
You want to say Irish Catholics? Sure, go ahead. You might get some sideways glances, but at least an argument can be made for it being a group that was given short shrift in the country's history. It's targeting an actual historical problem.
If you want to say a Black student scholarship doesn't address the problem if it is going to someone like Kanye West's son, I agree, that's not a great awarding of a scholarship either.
But at least there's a group being targeted with a Black or Women's scholarship that is trying to address a problem, in a way that just targeting socioeconomic doesn't really address
Because we see people disproportionately award those to white people too.
So yeah, you close the pool down by race, because you're trying to help a disenfranchised group.
I'm not trying to say only target those groups, nor saying leave poor white people behind too. I will say if you put a poor white person next to a poor black person and say who has the advantage, yeah, I'll say the white guy has an advantage. That's the problem, is that we don't treat them as equals. And even if we do, we're trying to say that is enough when it really isn't.
I'm saying that the basis of your argument is what is driving the problem you are trying to solve. Animals on average are about fairness, so when you give the black person something for being black you _drive_ the resentment
And I would argue your bias when you think of this hypothetical scenario of a white man next to a black man and the white man has an advantage because you are thinking of them in a _predominantly_ white environment, what happens when you put the white man in a predominantly black area does he still have that advantage?
That's a shallow way of thinking of it though: you aren't giving them something because they are black. They are still having to compete, it is just a smaller pool.
And yeah, I would say this white guy has an advantage because the environment is the US marketplace. Trying to confine it to just a predominantly black area is extremely limiting.
Ehhhh, but you did give them an advantage by having them compete in a smaller pool. At the same time an implication is that they could not compete at the same level in a broader pool
But that's the overall US population, not the particular population we're talking about which is the underserved population. Which is predominantly black. Ghettos are not generally well mixed population
But they are still part of a larger city
You are saying that talking about it drives resentment. So does not talking about it. Just not in your group
There's literally studies across numerous categories about how there's institutional racism, at multiple class levels.
For the city I agree, but I'm also not trying to give advantage to the whole city just a subset of it
I dont understand your not talking point, I would like you to elaborate
And my point is, that exists because ethnic groups are not equal represented in all classes, and its institutional classism
I am saying when you don't acknowledge the real problems with race in this country, you build resentment amongst those underserved communities. When you talk about it, yeah you build resentment, from the group that was getting the advantage play
I don't think you can solve one and ignore the other.
I'll grant you they are both problems
Hell, I'll grant you socioeconomic is a LARGER problem
I think you can solve both by having a more nuanced solution than skin color or genital
Sure, but you wouldn't solve it by replacing skin color with economic status
You want a scholarship and it targets only people below a certain level of income and skin color or female, sure, that would be effective.
And then make other scholarships available only to people below a certain economic level and take away all scholarships for people above a certain income, that would make progress.
The point I'm making is the ruling class is using this resentment to drive the oppression, because it keeps the oppressed in line (threat of limb) and the oppressors in line too (feeling of superiority over someone else)
I agree with everything except for the skin color gender why because you can point to studies but at an individual level it feels arbitrary
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
If your resume has to include your race or height or gender you have a problem
Well yeah, we do have a problem. Ignoring race doesn't solve that problem though
It's truly like saying "let's make the playing field level" when one team is up 64-0
We didn't restart the game
Once again that a class argument not a race argument
Race to me is like saying people over 6 feet have an advantage in reach and therefore shouldn't get something
But you acknowledged it yourself that a disproportionate part of the group in poverty, is black.
and I'm saying there is enough studies out there to show, that of the population, the black people will get helped less than the white group
Exactly! It's the poverty, not the black that holds them back
But because its easier to prove them black, you reward them and build resentment!
Resentment amongst who?
Amongst the people who do not get the advantage, or this case poor white people
So you'd ignore race, which I am arguing is just going to build resentment in the poor black community
Which then leads into it's the whites suppressing the balcks
Why because all poor people get an advantage?
Blacks suddenly have resentment for whites in the same situation as them?
Or do they have resentment for the whites above on the class ladder?
That same white guy doesn't walk down the street worrying about the police
Both are poor, white guy still has an advantage
Clearly with how 2016 onward has gone, we didn't get rid of racism. Hell, we've regressed
Exhausted
Just that kind of day
And why does the white man have the advantage? Because the police is not made up of the poor which makes it predominantly white
Sure, so your plan to solve that is?
And I would argue the poor white man gets shit on as much but no one cares. Once again in your mind your thinking middle class white
Because I see a lot of rich white people giving money to poor white people. Not just poor people across the board
I dont know of many charities that target oy white demographics
Right, instead I see a lot of small businesses that only hire "good kids."
People are confusing the affluent with the non affluent and using skin color as a proxy BECAUSE ITS EASY
No, they are using it because it's literally been seen in study after study. It's real.
It's the pro football player getting treated worse than the poor white guy, because one is black and the other is white
What part of "I agree with your study but they didn't control for class" am I not explaining properly?
But they do control for class when they find this!
Are there some that don't? Sure, those are bad studies for exactly that reason
All black pro football players? Or just the ones that stand for social change?
But should the white guy be allowed to build resentment and be racist and angry because an all black organization tried to help their own? That's on the black community to fix?
That's not the way the present the change is it?
This was Kam Chancelor in Vegas. He wasn't part of the group kneeling
Don't know the story, please enlighten me
<https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/michael-bennett-las-vegas-police-brutality-accusations-threat-to-kill-african-american-football-a7933536.html>
Michael Bennett not Kam Chancellor
Though there was a separate incident with him and trying to get the number for a gym he wanted to buy
Police brutality, in a shooting incident cherry picked because he's famous. I wonder how many other people the cops did that too. Was it random or targeted towards blacks?
That's what studies are showing, these things are disproportionate towards blacks. That's the whole reason for BLM
I'm not saying it's right, I'm saying we should dig deeper than race
Which kicked up a fury of blue lives matter and all lives matter
Which those miss the point
Why because when you make it exclusionary you make it _easy to target_
Agreed
Studies also show that when you provide context peoples decisions change
But seriously, you're saying dividing on race is being used as a divisive tool. Sure is, not arguing it is being manipulated.
Resentment of people being left out of a group and resorting to racism, shouldn't be on the oppressed group to bear
The other part that I'm saying is that you can better get to the root cause on a different vector
By doing what exactly?
What I'm saying is human nature will never allow you to get away from that
Class drew, this needs to be attacked on class lines
No, seriously, HOW?
Telling me attack class isn't a solution
Honestly I vote for universal income
Hadn't heard it before. I see UBI or just Basic Income
Same difference
I would argue getting rid of some of your hard to maintain social programs and switch to that
I'll read on it. How does it get around the problem of inflation?
I think the better question is how do you properly set, and I think theres good discussion still needed
I'm not sure how that meaningfully differs
If I set it at $100,000 then other jobs rise in pay to incentivize
and prices of goods rise because of the influx of people able to afford goods at prior prices
If that wouldn't happen, I would like to know why
Ohhhh that brings into a better of what drives inflation
Ohhhh that brings into a better of what drives inflation
Which also asks the question does tax breaks drive inflation? I don't think so, but I'm not aware of any study
<https://media.tenor.com/images/50de911a7d083bd9520323543b3cf8e5/tenor.gif>
Lol
Taxes generally don't help or hurt inflation as much as people argue their impact can be.
Taxes generally don't help or hurt inflation as much as people argue their impact can be.
I would argue it would have the same impact as taxes same source pretty universally impacting
I'm just going off of basic economics
Lol
I like that giphy
Regardless, this deviates a lot from the original point.
BUT IT WAS FUN!!!

Tehehehehehe
Ahhhhh :peace-and-tranquility:
I had a 1 hour 9:00 am
my day is ruined
I had a 1 hour 9:00 am
(not really it was a fun meeting)
That's good, but what meeting is fun at 9 am?
That's good, but what meeting is fun at 9 am?
Meetings with food and coffee?
That's good, but what meeting is fun at 9 am?
Maybe
Eh I have always like meetings
meetings like that can be a
mostly because people only invite me to meeings that are not pointless
I used to, but Wayfair ruined that for me
I tend to talk a lot in meetings, so they stay interesting
What meeting's aren't pointless?
LOL!
So you're just super chatty
I know just enough about everything that people think i know everything, meaning I have input on basically any questions
It's good to feel needed. Unfortunately I can relate to basically "invite creep" where you invite people to meetings because you might have a question for them to answer, but 90% of the meeting they don't need to be there.
It's good to feel needed. Unfortunately I can relate to basically "invite creep" where you invite people to meetings because you might have a question for them to answer, but 90% of the meeting they don't need to be there.
Or, a team of analysts get invited because "it would be good for you to listen in on this"
Instead of properly picking a manager, maybe an analyst to support, and then communicating the info to everyone else
Too much effort
Invite everyone, see who shows up
And then ignore all of them and complain about how you really wanted to talk to people who didn't show up
That's such a collective waste of man hours and exactly why I hate how so many companies do meetings
strikes a little too close to home does it?
Yeah I see a lot of my pms in those sort of meetings, but they tend to only invite tech leads in occationally
And before I was a tech lead, was just expected to be a code monkey and write code all day, so meetings were more appealing
ALRIGHT <@UETS9HTSS> <@UDDE5960N> <@UDC03KCGK> we should probably talk about some goals in our D&amp;D campaign.
Should we focus on getting stronger,
So murder more things?
I'm pretty sure all of these will lead to murder, but murder is not a goal by itself
You forgot making Jarem King
`Conquering the Dome`
what if we start a war between factions, and hole up with the third
Which faction do we pick though
Theres the "i like the dome" people, the "I hate the dome people, also im king" and i forget what the third party wants
we were getting an idea of what 3rd faction is when delta smacked in the head and almost died for his sins
Which just sounds like people who like the fact the mortal plane is in a bubble they can easily access
I think thats the people who aren't particluarly fond of the concept of dropping the dome
My vote is the root faction
Since that's where I'll be from
lol
but I don't have ties to them, just live in their sphere of influence
I'm thinking also thinking the root faction, because I think they'll let dakota be king the easiest
Do you think the dome extends to the Etherial plane?
It makes it easier to access
I will get a 3rd level spell that lets me go to the etherial plane, and back
Ohhhh fancy
blink?
yeah
I say we become double agents for the Bastion and True guard
And see how much murdering we can do
I think if you want to murder _people_ then the root faction is probably the best
though we may wind up fighting Gritander :sad_panda:
Yes, but we become double agents for both the Bastion and the True Guard to get access to stuff and make them think we're on their side for as long as possible
I don't think we are likely able to successfully pull off any sort of espionage
Ugh, the worst
That's the great part we don't have to
You literally just convince both groups we'll be the best spys for the other group
The problem I have with that is why would we do that?
like if we had a reason to go all double agent and a tangable goal to work towards by doing so (other than murder) then sure
Yeah, maybe it is me not being able to differentiate from Delta, but the most compelling goal to me is figuring out how we even got here. Who brought us here? Why? Why us of all people?
and I feel like leaving the Dome or conquering the Dome becomes a fork in the road based on what we find out in answers to those questions of how the hell we got wrapped up in this
For Dakota, if we're aligning with the root guard, then being a double agent and weakening the other 2 factions is preferable
For Drew, that's you, I got dropped in a murder sandbox and I really don't care why I got here
I guess the first question we should ask ourselves is Do we want to join a side, or do we want to just mercinary ourselves out freely?
I think becoming mercs will just result in taking a side TBH
We haven't met the root bound yet, we have barely met the Trueborn
So I don't want to just be "Bastian good!"
I'm with brenden, if we just go free for all, no one will allow us to rest
So we could just pick a favoured of disfavoured but that's about it
I'm pretty sure we are sitting in a shop with a person who can get us into the rootbound
Which I agree, we'll have to pick a side eventually. Just want to actually meet these factions first before going "Yup, aligning with them!"
But yeah, I don't believe my or many characters would wake up there after all this and go "That was weird. Next!"
So I definitely have the goal of "Why the fuck are we here, why us, who did it?"
I mean, this is the city that I was going to, so I got here, I'm happy
You're more than welcome to plunge the mysteries, but my goals are simple, acquire the sword of spinny and make Dakota  a king
But why does Thorium want Jarem king?
Sword of Spinny we got
Jarem is my buddy, the king of this place seems to have magical powers, Jarem needs to bitch slap a goddess in the face
Soooo, kind all makes sense to me
Why does he need to be king to bitch slap Beshabab?
If anything, making him king breaks the dome and puts him farther from that goal
He needs power to bitch slap Bashabab, being king grants him power
Also who doesn't want a king as friend?!?!?! All the fun none of the responsibility
I mean, the reason we're having this conversation is after you left we ended up talking to Doug how it felt we weren't really going anywhere and could use a bit more structure.
And at the moment, we as a group don't have a cohesive goal really
So we just kind of flounder around at the moment
Ok, useful context
I'm confused at the implications that my goals don't provide structure
Because they are YOUR goals. Not the group goals. Same as Jarem has his own goal. Not a group one.
And me going for my own goal wouldn't solve it, because it means any time we pursue one goal, the other 3 are just along for the ride
Aren't the group goals just going to be a summation of our individual goals?
Like you wanting know why we were chosen, we could tie that in with choosing a faction, which based on what we know today would be root bound
I mean, my opinion is that we're 3 sessions in what is essential a new world.  We've been playing the tutorial, of course we haven't made a lot of "progress" we're still trying to figure it out
Basically my issue is that we are just kinda doing things without having a reason to do said things. We went on that spider killing mission just cuz.

Instead we could have gone on the mission to:
Ingratiate ourselves with Gritander to see if that might lead closer to why we are here
Get stronger in a city that can obviously kick our asses
Earn some cash to gear up
Now however we have a hook and a book and have a choice to make
I disagree with the "Get Stronger in city" because that's exactly what we did, we got gold we got exp and we leveled up
Granted we let Barry Die
We accumulated 600gp+ of stuff, do think we would have accumulated more doing something else?
I was referencing the vampire that just shrugged of SHALALALA, giant angels, mega plants, vampire lords, and dragons
I'm not saying we should have not gone on the mission, I am saying we didn't have a reason why we wanted to go on the mission other than we didn't know what else to do
and to kill stuff does not make sense for a party goal either
And in that context, Barry died for nothing
Yep; that he did
He died because we wanted some money because we didn't know what else to do
Na we didn't even have money as our goal at the time. I think the alternative was tracking down the guard capitan
Na we didn't even have money as our goal at the time. I think the alternative was tracking down the guard capitan
True.
Point is, what would we as a group like to go after? Is Delta the only character that would be concerned about how the hell this all happened and following that lead?
Cause if so, fine I'll adopt that as just Delta's personal goal. But as far as the Sword of Spinny goes, I would tuck that into the back corner until we got to an obstacle and needed it as a source of more power in order to proceed with our greater quest
I mean Jarem probably thinks Beshaba has a hand in it, so I imagine hes pretty much along for the ride. I believe I am going to make him more motivated to become stronger, make my goal to punch beshaba, AND beable to survive one hit when she stirkes back. So im gonna try to go all super tank
When it comes to what we should be doing, I imagine i would be very interested in what is making reality so thin here, and being in the same camp as the vampires who seem to be just casually walking between realms might be an oooportunity
I think I would vote for throwing our hands in with the root people as dropping the dome might be counter productive to the thin reality, and we may just find out how and why we are here as we explore what the dome actually is
I mean, I'm not opposed to that, but I would still like to learn more about the root bound and see them in person before I just throw all in with them
Because as far as Delta is concerned, he got thrown into an unfamiliar place, attacked, and at least the Bastian gave us shelter and a place to call home base.
And is much more motivated after Barry's death to figure out who the hell got us here in the first place and make them pay
I mean to be fair, If I was teleported into a random huge city surounded by a dome, trying to figure out why probably wouldn't involve tryin to meat with the leards of the 3 big factions actively fighting a war of succession
I mean to be fair, If I was teleported into a random huge city surounded by a dome, trying to figure out why probably wouldn't involve tryin to meat with the leards of the 3 big factions actively fighting a war of succession
Hell we are probably lucky to have actually met the leader of one of the factions at all, considering we are all weak as hell
I mean to be fair, If I was teleported into a random huge city surounded by a dome, trying to figure out why probably wouldn't involve tryin to meat with the leards of the 3 big factions actively fighting a war of succession
Alright primary goal: Make Ettens go extinct
Thread getting long, new Thread:

Primary Goal: What is the Dome?
Discuss: What should we do next to further this goal
Additional Goals:
1. Stop blaming Delta for Barry's death (stated to be unfun for Delta)
2. Side quest for the sword of stabby
3. Meet our new companion
4. Get stronger
5. Guard Capitan
CJ likes Make Ettens go extinct, Thorium is in because it involves murdering things and becoming stronger
are we safe from getting one-shot after leveling up?
You're never safe
Because there is bigger scary monsters full of damage
The probability is much lower once you hit level 3
what if we kill boars until max level
PCs are very squishy at level 1 and 2
LOL!
We know what the Dome is, it's great magics gone haywire during the supposed "death" of the old king when he was casting a protection spell
But it is obviously doing more than just keeping things in/out
So your argument is understand our spacial and temporal situation ?
Which just goes to officially crowning a king so they can get into that room right?
Not necessarily. Once we figure out what the dome is doing, and maybe even how, we might find ways to take advantage of it without taking control
I'm not opposed to this, but it concerns me for 2 reasons, 1) other people have been trying to do this for 50 years, 2) we really don't have any heavy magic users in that way
Your first consern would also pertain to trying to crown a king. that has been happening by more than just these 3 factions for 50 years.
as for the second, we have a warlock/paladin, a druid, and a cleric. The only magic we are missing is an int based caster
I am very invested and enthralled by this conversation!
I cannot tell if sarcasm or not
<@UETS9HTSS> how high is your  int on your new char
So no interest at all in how the hell we wound up here? Or is that part of what is the dome?
So no interest at all in how the hell we wound up here? Or is that part of what is the dome?
<@UDC4QL95G> slightly above average
he's charisma based
that's part of the dome. I am under the impression that we are not there for any reason other than the fact that we got caught up in whatever the demon goat blood was needed for.
Well, that's still pretty important on why they needed the goat blood in the first place and destroy a ziggurat
My train of thought is
What is the dome doing -&gt; How does that explain the fey -&gt; does that explain the plant -&gt; are we tied to the plant -&gt; sword of stabby
I mean we literally gave him the blood of demonic creatures. that just screams "demonic summoning ritual"
Eh, knocking us out and sending us there with the blood took extra effort
What if we weren't knocked out?
We know we were
We literally lost consciousness
Did we lose consiousness, or did we simply just suddenly wake up on teh ziggurat
Cuz if its the latter, we totally could have been the ones who conducted the ritual
obviously being controlled somehow
though even if it was the former, we _still_ could have been the ones who conducted the ritual
We weren't there by our own will. Who's idea is this? That's my concern
"what is the dome" isn't a compelling question to me until I find out why we and this ritual were conducted from outside in the first place
Like in your train of thought, that's the question that then generates "well what the hell is the dome anyway?"
Which fits into a lot of stabbing people in revenge for Thorium
And growing stronger for you to punch Beshaba
But whatever happened with the goat blood, it was obviously meant as a means of siezing attempting to size the throne, we just happened to be convenient tools
Ok, but those forces know a way out and in from the dome
Figure that out, you then figure out more about how it works.
Well they at least know how to get in, and how to communicate with the outside
and thus, lets figure out what the hell is going on with this dome
hell, all three factions _probably_ know how to leave the dome
I find you do that in reverse order
Figure out who can do these things, then you learn from them how the dome works
Well we know all three factions can, otherwize they wouldn't be balanced in power
And the way I see it, the ones who summoned are probably not going to be likely to play nice if start sticking our nose in their business. Though that may be exactly what we want
That's an assumption
Exactly
I think we might be mixing up the how and the what here.

What do we want to do: Figure out whats goin on with the dome
How do we do that: Well we start by finding out who knows more

Where we are at now, we have a book on succession, a companion loosely afiliated with the root people, a suspicious Gratandar, and a cursed helmet with a threat from a group that may or may not be the third faction
oh and a level 16 vampire that seems pretty open to questions, even after getting SHALALALA'd to the face
Also dont forget the minotaur guy didn't believe us till the angle vouched, so I think your over estimating the factions magical prowess on getting in or out of the bubble

so im pretty sure our entire js repo just kinda died, and so now they are trying to roll back the whole thing to a point earlier in the day

I'm trying to cram in the rest of my higher paying work hours before heading to Doug's
And much as I absolutely love this slack, it's also a huge distraction some days.
I can get behind that
I'm pretty sure we are arguing the same thing? You are looking at short term goals, while I am looking at long term.

First priority does not mean it comes first in the timeline
I think i'm the only person who doesn't care about how we got here and more interested in what mayhem i can cause
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFl736JpGw>
Looks like a fun game
NEEDED TO BREAK TRIPLE DIGITS THREAD!
higher paying work hours?
So much for triple digits
I work 2 part time jobs. One pays better than the other but is only for this month and next and only 20 hrs max per week
Literally
I see
turns out somebody force pushed their branch to the master branch
they are still trying get things back to normal after 4 hours
ewwwww
And who's getting the chopping block for that one?
I think of them as separate goals not long term vs short. Thorium clearly is fine being here because he can get his sword. 
Delta was on the streets most of his life so a city is a city to him. 
So figuring out what is going on with the dome only becomes a goal if we go far enough in the campaign to care about getting out. 
Figuring out who did this to us and why helps motivate future decisions. Understanding more about the dome is just kind of useful context for understanding other goals, like you punching Beshaba, or CJ getting his sword. It informs other decisions and goals, but in and of itself...no one cares.
Hopefully the idiot that force pushed it
I'm curious who they are?
normall it is blocked, but the person managed to sneak in while a deploy thing was happening and it was unlocked temporarily
WTF?!?!?1
That's such a bad idea
wayfair also pretty much forces people to use `push --force` on their own branches so many people just push force out of habit
Ohhhh..... now I kinda feel bad for the person
Sounds like a shitty practice got everyone burned
Do we need to care about why the event that brought us here occured though?
Also, wanting to cause mayhem is kinda hard to work with, as somebody like that is likely to just get killed
Alright, not anarchy mayhem, more like I'm here, this is my environment how do I best survive it, which to me boils down to the things you've already described getting stronger and picking a favored or disfavored faction
Figuring out who did this to us and why helps is a short term goal though. Lets just pretend for a moment that we know without a doubt that the root people did it in a summoning ritual that summoned the plant. Now what?
Eh i suppose if you think about it, doug could very well make figuring out why difficult, so we dont really _have_ to think about longer term goals.
We go to the floating tower and begin our reign of tower on the peasants below us!
lol the tower is tilted at an 80 degree angle
We just have to right it, or just get use to walking on walls
Makes it extra dangerous for invaders because of all those damn window traps
Alright here is a physics problem.
Drew can create a gust of wind 10 foot wide that blows anybody within it 15 feet away. This wind lasts 1 minute and originates at the caster. Every 6 seconds the direction of the wind may be changed. How much weight can be lifted assuming we have a parachute that can withstand the strain
I think the wind speed is also relevant
Also how random do we think this wind is?
wait... Are you saying this wind is strong enough to move a full grown adult male 15 feet?
yup
it is wind that if you walk into it, it cuts your speed in half
basically it is a wind that will knock you off your feet and send you rolling back 15 feet if you are not prepared
What do you think Cat 1 hurricane or Cat 2?
I'm thinking Cat 1 personally
That's like where you have to lean in and brace yourself
I have no concept of hurricane winds. I grew up in teh midwest
didn't have to even think about them
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqfExHpvLRY>
After watching that I'm thinking Cat 2
which is say 100 mph winds
Lets assume that the wind is 10 ft in circle diameter
Some thing on the order of (10/2)^2*.00256*100^2*2
1280 lbs
So it would have to weigh less than that
:pundog:
Good morning y'all!
I'm concerned about you Aysh
lol i thought that was the bot
Happy Friday!
Nope, no bot
She's just lost her mind
Ohhh also gravity is 32 ft/s^2
so like 200 lb would be accelerating at 204 ft/s^2
It's amazing more people don't by the end of a long week
soo in 6 seconds it would reach 1228 ft per second
or roughly 4 football fields a second
that... doesn't seem right
WHOOPS
I missed a pie in there
NO, YOU'RE A NOBOT!
Yeah, that sounded kind of crazy
it's 4021 lbs is the force you would exert not 1280
I don't think you realize how strong of a wind you create over what is a relatively large area
according to my calculations, a 100mph wind would only generate 90 lbs of upward force on a 10 food diameter area
<https://sciencing.com/convert-wind-speed-force-5985528.html>
Also Dakota you basically made my point. We know it is the Rootbound in that scenario. I would be less inclined to team up with them in that because they were trying to hurt us. Or they explain why we got caught up in it and are willing to reward us, thus the next and future goals. We might want to stay in the dome if their reasons are compelling. In which case understanding more about the dome is not as useful as the scenario in which we want out. 
I'm thinking about this as a long term goal because finding those people involve a lot of smaller short term goals.
oh wait hold on i missed a squarred
Understanding more about the dome, might be one of those shorter tern goals.
Also be careful those are metric and we're working in imperial units
I did the conversions and wound up with 17k lbs of force
huh
And now you're way above me
Also don't these calculations need to take into account the lift from a parachute as a more aerodynamic object than a creature
<https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Wind-Load>
That is in imperial
In correct, parachutes are incredibly less aerodynamic than you, this is why the lower your terminal velocity so much you don't become a red splat
I mean on the going up section
Of course going down they are less aero dynamic. Just like an arrow is less effective if you put the arrow head on backwards
The way this works is your in the parachute and you shoot the wind straight up
The parachute captures this forces the same way it captures the wind when you're falling
The difference is that the wind speed going up is WAYYYYY higher than wind speed going down

1. What if the potion lady just explains who did it and why?
2. In my scenario, we were just unfortunate collateral damage, they wren't trying to hurt us at all
3. Does knowing who brought us here really help us figure out who we should help out, if any? What if the people who brought us here actually mesh most with us
We should probably seperate these threads

I know how parachutes work. My point is it is more effective at harnessing the wind than you are. Same as a truck tipping over from heavy winds that you don't because of surface area
Highly aerodynamic items have low drag, because drag makes you fall out of the sky
So I'm not sure if you're confusing what aerodynamic means, or something else
oh wait i got just under 4000 lbs upward force
which actually seems reasonable
4000 lbs aligns with my estimate too
Finding out these answers for real begets these kinds of questions and future goals. 
How does the dome work does not. We find out how the dome works...ok, now we what? Escape? Stay put? It doesn't motivate anything. It's like reading the entire dictionary because it could be helpful, instead of targeting the specific section you need to reference for your current project.
basically it can accelerate 4000 lbs at 1 foot/sec, though upward we would have to subtract the force of gravity
I'm taking about upward drag. You are a broad body going through the wind, even straight up. The top of a parachute, especially a balloon, is rounded. Spherical shapes are incredibly aerodynamic. On the way down it isn't, because it is concave on that side. The top being convex is more shaped for ascending
You shaped rockets as pointed
true, but wind resistance doesnt' really matter too much in this case as we dont want to be accelerating very fast anyway
I don't think we can control that
assuming all the wind is caputred, 3300 lbs would almost exactly counteract the upward force. Anything less would begin to move upward
we control it by adding weight :lol:
Would that affect the acceleration? I know it would affect the height achieved
the source of the upward force will be moving with us, so hight achieved is effectively infinite
the spell casts wind from the caster
So I'm just going to spam this upward?
I think this is hilarious and not originally intended

good morning, when are you playing next? :smile:
Dunno, it probably won't involve me, given I will no longer be in the country by the end of the week
I'm not gonna lie, I think if you really want to pursue this, you might want to tip doug off.  For the most part he's just been trying to introduce us to characters in the city
Example: Blood in the vial was human blood for vampire and has nothing to do with our ceremony
Enjoy the east!

Do you go to CRG? There's one next to North Station so if so was wondering what you prefer about the central square one
The real eastie
I have a membership to CRG as well as Brooklyn Boulders
The Brooklyn Boulders one will expire in August
the one by north station is where I took CJ
it's bouldering only, so if toprope is desired, brooklyn boulders is the one to go to
What do you mean by the central square one?
Oh great! Cause North Station is waaaay easier to get to than Central Sq
What do you mean by central square?
Oh, then I thought there was. Whoops
Well since CJ is going to be gone for the near future, let me know when you want to head to CRG by north station
Can we talk about why this meme exists? What were they supposed to be shooting???
Looks like a hospital, my guess some sort of comedy
basically 2 people don't want to stay in the hospital bed and there's only 1 nurse to deal with them
It does say by "A24" which is a movie studio

Moments like this make my day better
Also has anyone from games club left Wayfair other than Victoria? Just seems like people were leaving at a steady rate which tapered off after
No, like I said I think games club died a little bit
In fun news, Bolyston is getting it's own set of games
So maybe we'll see a resurgence?
hopefully! i also feel like people must, by now, have gotten used to a new routine
Well the club dying doesn't mean people haven't left the company.
How's it getting it's own games? Company sponsored or there's another Corin?
Company sponsored
Just saying maybe games club lost some critical mass
Still, just wanting to make sure people who love know this is here
No one I'm aware of

However, speaking of Chris, we need to play Fate of the Elder Gods with CJ
uff- sorry :smile:
uff- sorry :smile:
wait waht?
Didn't chris get another game that he wanted to try?
Drew no longer is working a 9-5; he appears to be doing a closing shift at his job, which apparently means until 2am
10-2am is not a normal shift though
Perhaps he's working a longer shift so he can take a day off?
I sincerely hope that's not normal for him
Or he has both his jobs on the same day back to back?
Or he has both his jobs on the same day back to back?
<@UDC4QL95G> DID YOU SEE THEIR DOING A MONITOR AUDIT!!!
Apparently Clover left again and went to Atlassian
#nonwork-bos is talking about it
what is a monitor audit?
I have a few
Fate is a classic we should play
they're going to go through the office and reclaim monitors that don't fit an approved configuration
you need to label employee owned monitors
they're offering self service dropoff points as well
Larger game is Deadwood 1876 and One Week Ultimate Werewolf
They're looking to reduce new hardware acquisition costs for the incoming intern/co-op flood this summer
:waythrifty:
My manager is about to have a monitor reclaimed :laughing:
people get too attached to things no?
I always think that's bullshit. "Hey, come work for us, have a shiny!"
"Hey, dirtbag, give up your nice shit for an ungrateful college kid. Who cares about your productivity despite being more productive in a week than this kid will be in 3 months"
<@UDD45P5A9>  wins
I take off Thursday and Friday for my sister in law's graduation so my 4 hour shift at the morning job is extended and then my night job is always till closing
I mean I've heard of people working doubles before so I'm not overly shocked
And drew's answer kinda aligns, more hours less days
I am also going to have a monitor reclaimed, though I am just going to pick up a secondary onitor on the cheap and keep my nice big fancy one from wayfair
I have heard good things about one week ultimate werewolf
Day 3: the php segfaults from yesterday seem to have calmed down, though my deploy was removed from the queue at 7:50PM. I requeued this morning but soon after gitlab exploded. Its possible that it will take up to 6 hours to resolve. Maybe tomorrow will be better.
Oh yeah she left a couple months back
WTF is going on over there?
who knows man. I have had this same deploy in the queue since friday
and then shit dies and i cant deploy
FUCK YOUR DEPLOY!
apparently
Does this mean you get to be lazy
Or does this mean you have to try?
not really, i code less these days so git dying doesn't have as much impact
I'm not really sure why it keeps saying successful
What do you do on a daily basis?
because it was successfully merged into the branch, but the branch never actually went out
mostly code reviews, meetings, answer questions, and figure out how to make the stuff my team is responsible for better.
I thought you wanted the individual contributor route?
This sounds like what I do
It likes to taunt you regularly
I technically am, though individual contributor route is still more design than implementation
the other route is more people management, where i am more techincal design and questions
ahhhhhhh

PRETTY SLIM IF YOU ASK ME!
You know I have to say I know why people don't want entry level business anymore
It's exhausting
entry level business?
L1 business side
like to be entry level business or to manage them
manage them
Because I can't even give them 2 weeks worth of work without being concerned their gonna fuck it up
I am finding that I am liking training L2 engineers then L1s
they get up to speed so much quicker
Yes
L2s also can be left alone without blowing shit up
for L1s i never forget that they are new. L2s I can quickly forget how new they really are
though L2s I feel are a bit more likely to blow shit up, since they are a bit more confident in deploying, thus they double check their code less
Maybe that's more a problem on the engineering side
I can't get my guys to see beyond their noses
HOW IS THERE :salt: AND NO :PEPPER:?!?!
HOW IS THERE :salt: AND NO :PEPPER:?!?!

I have my emoji agent remedying the situation
There's no pepper emjoi in wayfair either
I thought it was on purpose, you're allowed to be salty, but not peppery
:spicy:
BUT I WANT SALT AND PEPPER!
:pepper: now exists in wayfair
:pepper: now exists in wayfair
Nice!

Not really, redoing a proposal for the 40th time as our customer keeps wanting updates
That's the best!
Wait... I thought you worked for the government
I AM YOUR CUSTOMER!
No, I work for a company that works for the government, mostly
So alas, you are NOT my customer
Damn it, I wanted to make ridiculous demands so you'd have to make a crap ton of proposals
Alas, not how it works
Ouch, that must have hurt

Anyway bonus discover is that we might actually be able to trigger hide messages from users

make sense
that's probably why it was missing your first pass
I still think it makes sense to exclude hiddens too
yeah that does make sense
Now to figure out how to ultize the power of the hidden command!
I think it is just a parameter in the call to message

Good morning! long flights are not as bad as people claim- its just an excuse to be a vegetable, eat all the food you can obtain and watch old Hitchcock movies you otherwise would never

I'm able to obtain too much food; that would be a bad idea
Ummmmm, that is not the life for me!!!
Yes, but what better excuse to pig out?
how about if I'm visiting a place with actual great food that I can't get close to home?

play phone games
listen to an audiobook
read a physical or digital book
if you have a laptop, play some offline steam games
sleep
I mean nintendo switch has most games worth playing these days
get drunk
switch
who needs a laptop anymore
According to reddit, break up with your significant other
people who don't have a switch
isn't that just r/relationships
or are you referencing something specific?
Also not all games are on switch! HERE I COME RIMWORLD!
Wait, break up with your SO? Hopefully they're not on the plane with you
I'm guessing that's the joke
There's a photo of a girl crying captioned "I just bought wifi so I could tell you this guy broke up with his girl on the plane. We still have 5 hours to go"
I hope they didn't have adjacent seats
That is. Horrifying
Ohhh they did
that's cruel and unusual punishment
Agredd
Did reddit give details on why they broke up?
No
let me destroy your world, and not give you the privacy to fall apart
Now I'm very intrigued
I mean it could be staged but I could see a moron doing it too
Anyway lots of amusement for me, so I'm good
Yeah, I don't struggle with long flights either. I crush movies back to back
I've also really enjoyed long flights, lots of time for old lady crafts
Then I got Breath of the Wild and now just have hours and hours of game play to get through just ditzing around without actually doing campaign stuff.
You and Sam would make fast friends with your knitting and crocheting
:hmm: I should buy a switch
Breath of the Wild is like a solid 200 hours of gameplay unless you are the person that just sticks to the on rails main quest and literally nothing else.
Lol
"got" should really be "borrowed" from <@UDC4QL95G>
In which case it feels lacking
I don't knit or crochet actually, I'm a fan of counted cross stitch
You get to stab fabric many times until you get something pretty
Lol, that's the Victoria I know!
Between that, stardew, and Mario Odyssey, you have enough for several flight
I never got into stardew
what's the draw?
I never got into stardew

I played it for like 10 minutes on PC

Don't really know, I just know that I got hooked right away.
It's the same draw as Harvest Moon as far as I know.

Korean BBQ over there must be amazing
As we noticed I want to be the cider/sake ranger!
It was pretty damn good, even mei agrees
How long you there till?
I don't need to know how many hours you spent drinking and eating food
Tomorrow we fly out to Japan. We stay there till 31st
Less drinking, more eating. Was with Mei and her mom till like Tuesday. Down side is mei has some alcoholic friends in Hong Kong
By tomorrow I mean 11pm your time
Where does her mom live?
I'm sure multiple nights of getting hammered isn't your jam
Mom lives in Boston, she flew in with us and separated ways. Yea, fun buzzed is ok. Spending the next morning in recovery not so much

I man here we are pinging him at whatever time it is in japan. Not sure why he wouldn't reciprocate. He's the one we are bugging at all hours of then night while he is on vacation
That's only if he hadn't set up nighttime mode where you don't get pings
theres a nighttime mode???
Kinda, you can set a reoccurring Do Not Disturb for whenever you want, I set mine for nighttime
huh, that is very good to know
I've just been letting notifications do as they please
Oh no, I like not being woken up when I'm sleeping unless it's an emergency, and so far slack has not had an emergency

Context: My team has a pod outing today and is ordering pizza.

```Allright, I chose 4 pizzas that should make almost everyone happy: Tuscan Tomato Basil, Hawaiian, Supreme, Margarita```

Am I mistaken in thinking that those 4 pizzas are not a safe bet for making everybody happy?
I wouldn't be happy with that
I'd eat the first and last
but wouldn't be happy
Having had to order pizza as well, I try to always have a plain cheese because sometimes people want to be a picky 2 year old
what's on supreme anyway?
lost me at green pepper and pepperoni
also turns out that Tuscan Tomato Basil and Margarita are very close to the same thing
yep; was mildly confused by that
I wish grandma pizza was a thing around here
whats that
topipngs unclear
it's not just toppings
spinich is all i got
it's also the style of crust/dough
oh gotcha the square thick pizzas
Looks like mozz, basil, sauce
usually actual tomato on there as well somewhere
fresh mozz is pretty common
basil
spinach
pan pizza
garlic
Sooo, fluffy margarita?
yeah, kind of
I thought that Pizza stand in the PRU had this kind of pizza. It could just be a rectangle normal pizza though
Also its really hard without wifi/internet
Also its really hard without wifi/internet

Gotta being you guys an RI specialty, pizza strips or party pizzas!
you dont have wifi???
pizza strips intrigues me
In China he's probably not paying for wifi
Isn't internet over there supposed to be crazy cheap

When I'm out and about I got pretty much nothing
I'm in Seattle, delayed arrival means we get in at midnight now :(

I'm intrigued by pizza strips
Also Brenden you don't care for pepperoni?
it's meh
don't actively dislike it
I'm excited to be home
but it doesn't add any thing positive
just grease
Well that's good. Sounds like a fun trip overall but also a pretty tiring one. Like too much drinking
Pepperoni is delicious!
Yea.... there was a night of too much drinking too
I missed the earlier part of the conversation but I've found if you're trying to make everyone happy, you get at least one pepperoni, a cheese pizza, and then one that has some veggies, and then one that is heavy on meats.
You know it
My favorite is the stick you cut and cook on a George Foreman grill
I also cook and eat sticks on george foreman grills
YOU NEED A CHEESE FREE ONE!!
Problem is too many people ordering just as many cheese pizzas as pepperoni of meat pizzas. Cheese isn't that popular, it's just there to satisfy those who don't want any of the other options
My sister refuses to eat any pizza other than cheese....
it bugs me
cheese is also pretty popular
I might go as far as to disagree with that
Pepperoni stick
well, judging by NY anyway
up hear not as much
I have never seen cheese pizza be equally popular to pepperoni or meat heavy pizzas.
Popular? Sure, 1 out of every 4 people or 1 out of every 3
I'm full on board the meat heavy pizza train
MEATS!!!
IF you could only get a 1 topping, what would it be
this is a hard one
Also an update to how the pizza went: There was a ton of Hawaiian left. The rest were mostly gone.
10 people total.
sausage?
Hawaiian is an aquired taste.
Definitely crumbly sausages
If you're going to do pineapple on a pizza, BBQ chicken with pineapple as a topping works out better in my experience
I am of the opinion that any cooked fruit is an acquired taste.
Thus my dislike for apple pie
Pepperoni
Gonna have to agree with drew here
DISLIKE OF APPLE PIE!?!?!?
There's a...cold take?
yeah I dont really like pie in general
I mean, I order pepperoni pizzas on the regular. That is a one topping pizza
Unless we're saying no sauce or cheese
naa that aint a pizza at that point
...in which I'd still be ok with bread and pepperoni. Called a pizza bianca in Rome. It's delicious!
I usually only order on topping as well since those are always the cheapest
Store pick up is stupid cheap
More of a cake guy?
No car
Or brownies?
yeah she's already in there
5 topping large is cheaper than like a medium 3 topping
Summon the Silent
From where? that dont make sens
Think that was deja vu
oh shit
DEJA VU STRIKES AGAIN!
bamboozled
well cj is also sometimes replaced with a bot
Right, which adds to the chaos
that thread deserves input from those two anyway
That's why you have to look for the tag
Well, the tag sometimes mean it is you anyway
exactly, the tag sometimes means nothing, but only for you
Domino's is like that
Larges carry out has a special that is better than the 2 medium 2 topping deal
I am going to consider it a good thing that I don't live close enough to a dominos to be willing walk a pizza home

<@UDC4QL95G> Alarms are not suggestions! We have chaos to cause tonight!
<@UDC03KCGK> How are you doing with all those college students??? Still alive?
<@UDD45P5A9> ONE OF US!!! ONE OF US!!! ONE OF US!!!!
<@UHQD9J1SL> Good Morning! Are you still interested in Mei bringing you around food places of boston?
<@UDBV9N1E0> :wave:
@dnd_adventures did we ever decide on what we're trying to accomplish?
that's a new one
@dnd_adventures
:hmm:
I died and my new character hasn't been introduced yet
so I may have different goals
Valid point, if there are any other groups you want to be able to quickly reference let me know
The free version doesn't have groups, so I made Prometheus do it
yesssssssss i have a reminder set up o ask you about it when youre 'back' :stuck_out_tongue:
Am officially back
yay! next weekend?
I'm still alive, but trying to get over a cold that has lingered for a week.
ewwwww
<https://whdh.com/news/boston-police-responding-to-daylight-shooting-in-the-back-bay/>
so uhh
Well
I'm glad we're not over there anymore
this was over by the prudential stop by the green line
so the place I walk by every day to work thats like 3 blocks from my apartment
It no longer appears to be an active threat..
yeah somebody said they arrested the dude
That is always good
YEA!!!!!
JUSTICE

So which roommate got fired <@UETS9HTSS>?
woh just saw that. What happened?
the white one; francesca
Bummer
Do you know what happened?
I don't think it was any one thing
Ahhhhhh
her job wasn't particularly specialized
and I don't think her manager liked her very much
her manager was kind of a bitch though
what was her postition?
not sure on the title/specifics
Merch had another purge, quite a few people from my old team got the axe, including one who just got back from vacay
That always suckss
I think she was in merch
Ahhhhhhh
Does wayfair give you a heads up or is it more a "and now we're gonna walk you out, good luck!"
Wayfair just continues to make up reasons to fire people. They have SEVERLY slowed down the rate of hiring L1 and even L2's now.
I'm pretty sure everybody at wayfair is At Will, so they can fire people willy nilly
and this is far from the first purge we have had
Didn't we fire literally all of B2B Sales a year or two back.
On my old team (the one Brendon's roommate was also on), they get rid of people they don't like with be reasons and sometimes backdate a pip to make it 'legal'
I mean Dakota, we had Annual purges at CVS, but most of those are like you have 2 more weeks sooo good luck
Oh yeah, all of B2B was removed, all of mass sales were as well
Vs "Hey today's your last day BYEEEE!!!"
it wasn't even just today's your last day
it was, you can't return to your desk and pick up your stuff
we'll mail it to you
Oh shit thats nuts
At least they'll mail now, it used to be your manager or teammate can pack it up for you if you want
That's brutal, because I know Chris Bell's org kill a group and they transferred internally to other positions
4 people were gone before 1030, and 1 more was gone before 9 today
Coincidentally they brought in 300+ new hires that started yesterday alone
a lot of those are interns though
Sent an email out saying to stay away from the second floor kitchen and the entirety of Tower 1 entrance
Makes for a hostile work environment, better than being laid off early November though
LOL!
That happened to a friend who was on the same team as Fran and I
I was talking to another engineer on one of my sister teams, and she was horrified hearing about wayfair's  policies outside engineering. Its crazy how clean the separation is
That was when CVS's annual purge was, usually between like 400-500 people per year
I wonder how often wayfair fires people.
Yea..... you guys get insulated from a lot of Corporate stuff.  Enjoy it!
Think csn_hr has a table that tracks the difference between "fired" and "quit"
On merch they try to make you quit and if you don't, then they fire you, they've fired probably 1/4 to 1/3 of my old team in 6 months
I'm surprised they don't go more for layoffs here
Actually we have 3 or 4 of our pms that come from Customer service. There is a whole private channel for customer service survivors
WTF
yeah they let that channel slip during a bar crawl. I think its great
LOL
that's pretty neat though
You have been inducted into the "survivors club"
kinda similar to what we have going here, though half of us still work at wayfair
I guess so
Kinda similar. It's a good stay in touch network for post Wayfair
I mean it's like 5 of us, not that much of a network
when was this? :open_mouth:
Yesterday/today
I count 10
Active in the last month
You mean in all the channels or just this channel?
8 in this one.
Ehhh, I'll give you 7 here
Richard's still too new to know if he'll weigh in or not
Eh, but he counts toward the main channel, along with Doug and Tyler
Hence I got 10
Makes sense then
Maybe if <@UE2D3HCBW> wanted to say something we'd have 11
Recruiting Dave would get us back up to 11
MUST HUNT HIM DOWN
Go for it, and let me know when the hunt is on
Wow really missed out on this thread 
There's a very good reason why this channel is defined as chaos monkey
And the head chimp is back in action!
Originally we didn't make this a default channel due to the number of random bots and general chaos in here. It is the primary active channel though in the group

30 second exercise vs fixing giphy which is probably more like a 15 min exercise
heres where the files are hosted if you want to play around. that is the live code and any updates happen in real time
Ugh, fine
First you mention crickets, then a broken giphy, now you're just leaving. I expected more from Capt Stabby
hmm should we try to stop dejaVu from pinging people, or is it just funnier that way
I don't think it does actually ping people
But I agree it's funnier this way
It does, thats what the blue highlight means
Ohhhhh
NEAT
Capt Stabby has bigger things worth stabbing
I think there is a param we can add to the api call that will avoid that
Full of more blood and guts!
Nahhhhh
forgot about this one
This is more fun
Me too

As you should be.... Are you sure you went to the right place at the right time?!?!!?
I'm 90% sure

Enjoy it I guess? Because we both know that won't last
Maybe summer vacations have started???
I guess? But if I'm able to move in a few months the commute will always be nice and I'll miss the stress and chaos
Coming more downtown?
Not quite, across the river to cambridge/sommerville
That brings you farther away from us right?
Same time to get downtown, just from a different direction and closer to work
Ahhhh, WINNING!
Hence the desire to move, which is turning out to be difficult
:disappointed:
Oh well, it's mostly because I can't do the Sept 1st lease change thing
Ewwwww college students
I know right! But also, won't be in town that weekend, so legit can't move
Stupid friends getting married
need to tell your friends to move the wedding to non-moving week!
Yeah, that's not going to happen, they have to fight hard to get a date this year, the Wedding market here apparently is very competitive

Ive heard that authentic soup dumplings are made with solidified pork fat that becomes 'soup' once warmed- hence the question!
<@UDC4QL95G> ARE YOU ALIVE!??!?!?!!

I mean any gelatin would work in this case
Animal fat is generally the easiest
Gelatin is made from animal by product generally, so maybe not a good substitute
hmmmm probably
Good to know
its typically the first thing i check each morning
exactamundo!!!
I feel like the first thing you check is if you have to be awake
Yeah I don't typically wake up and check my pulse or spin a top to see if it falls over
I mean the simple fact of regaining conciousness is a check as to whether or not your are alive
What if you become a ghost
Then you would be dead and conscious
That depends on if Sleeping is a trait of the living. If you die, does your ghost "wake up"
Sleeping is a state of the body and mind, and therefore I would argue that your body never wakes up
if you wake up, you are by definition alive
Do ghosts dream?
Anyway, your check is implicit which I would argue is not a true check as "checking" something is an action and therefore explicit
isn't gelatin vegetarian but not vegan?
It depends on the vegetarian's own restrictions. I'd consider it not vegetarian
I feel like vegetarian is becoming more and more of a scale between omnivore and herbivore
*shrug* I haven't been a vegetarian anymore for close to 10 years, so a bit out of the vege loop
I vehemently disagree with that
Vegetarian is _by definition_ not on the scale with omnivores
Vegan in one step further than herbivore IMO
Vegan is herbivore, literally by definition.  There's nothing beyond herbivore
Vegetarians are omnivores because they can have foods created by animals that do not kill the animal (classic definition)
But pescatarian's are version of vegetarian but are allowed fish
Which once again is between true omnivore and true herbivore
I imagine ghosts dont sleep, as there is no physical requirement to sleep, so probably dont dream either.
Pescatarians also by definition not vegetarian, but pescatarian
Idunno if you were scared of dying in your sleep, at that point you may consider waking up to be a check that you were alive, even though the "action" there is no different than the implicit action
I'll accept that argument, but would argue they were born out of that movement
In terms of a scale of what people eat they are on it though
I would also agree they were born out of the movement, but they are not in fact vegetarian
That's more my point, there's lots of people who call themselves vegetarian with exemptions, and we have since classified them
But I, maybe incorrectly, still think of them as "vegetarian"

<@UDC03KCGK> Good luck with the drunkards tonight!
<@UDD45P5A9>
<@UHQD9J1SL>
<@UDBV9N1E0> Safe travels fellow commuter rail user!
Nah, today's a day shift. No drunk customers, just a bunch of delivery drivers in cargo shorts.
good morning!
FWIW, I prefer no meat, but do occasionally eat non-beef/ non-pork meats (those two are religiously off my plate) and avoid gelatin unless its in pills Ive been prescribed :slightly_smiling_face:
Oh the commuter rail! It was nice and empty this morning :slightly_smiling_face:

*Forceful Hand*
_wondrous item, common_

A white glove that can be activated using a command word. When the command word is spoken, an after image of the hand is conjured in the exact form the glove is currently in. This functions like a Mage Hand that simply stays in place for one minute. Used to prop open doors/windows, allows bar wenches to levitate a serving tray while using both hands to hand out beverages/food, or to flip someone off and walk away at the same time.
I was looking through #non-work-dnd and brenden posted it that
And now I really want it
There was also
*Glove of Challenge:*
_wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

A finely crafted, yet otherwise unremarkable leather glove. As a bonus action, the attuned wearer may remove the glove from their hand and attempt to make an unarmed strike against a creature using the glove, attempting to slap the target with the glove. On a hit, the target must make a DC 15 wisdom saving throw or be subjected to the effects of the Compelled Duel spell. Once used, this ability may not be activated again until the next dawn.

If after the unarmed strike, the glove is dropped to the ground, it will fade from reality at the beginning of the attuned's next turn, unless it's currently worn or carried. One minute after disappearing in this manner, an identical replacement glove will appear on the hand of the attuned that wore the previous glove.
But I feel like my character doesn't have the _omph_ to use it correctly
I need an item that gives me a useful bonus action without having to throw out a L2 spell
Becoming a rogue?
what are your bonus actions?
I don't have any
at least none that don't require a long rest to get back
I don't think bonus actions are all that common
I mean you want to give up actions and hide behind shields
Idunno, I don't think giving up actions is a good idea
I mean I agree with that
I mean you're already pretty much just a spell bot though
yeah, once I get enough level 2 spell slots, I will be able to start using a spell that should deal some decent damage
Any idea when you get that? We get to be level 4 next time
I get a third level 2 spell and an extra cantrip
Not bad! Now you'll be able to cast more than _Toll the Dead_
I read that as Troll the Dead and was a bit upset when I read it correctly
Well there is only one other attacking cantrip i can take, and I'm not sure I really _need_ another one
Well what other cantrip would you take?
```You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.

```
Lol, I can hear the curses when we never use it
Its more of something to use out of combat. The only real alternative is something to stabalize somebody who is dying, but it doesn't bring them above 1hp
Ohhh.... interesting
also, I realized today that my mending cantrip has more uses than I originally thought
I never thought about intentionally breaking stuff, then mending it back around something
or if you bust open a lock, I can mend it with no trace
Can we use mending on people?
nah, just objects
but it can be used on crap like arrows
Ambushes, we smash down a door and mend it
why this lull in conversation :think-load:

Meetings?
Meeting :(
Same
so wayfair has been allowing customers automatically get replacement items as long as they are small parcel and they are below a certain price threshold
They are just starting to realize that setting that threshold at $1000 is probably not the best idea
it only took a customer ordering a replacement on a $700 vaccuum 8 times for them to realize something was wrong
WHAT?!?!?
No shit that's funny
3,500 is the trigger for us to care
Good to know!
WTF IS THE SECOND THING?!?!?!
We also only do a single fraud check per order, so yeah
IT LOOKS SO NEAT!
well, yea cause this is a different type of fraud
I'm suprised there's not like a 2 reorder limit
yeah there are basically no limits
Wonder if they're going to put limits in now
most likely
You need to use mend on Wayfair software
It's clearly in need of mending
For sure.
No focus today
I needed more meetings
it's easier to look busy then
It's a double barrel shotgun that shoots slugs
It's a double barrel shotgun that shoots slugs
Bottom top config, got it.  Sport shooting guns then?
Non-work has shots fired today
Someone is selling sneakers for 550
Another person called them out because retail is 222
And they shot back that internet prices are 565
Because they launched today
PEOPLE ARE INSANE
They're just shoes?
Sneakers
YEEZY BOOST 350 v2 BLACK
Just because you yell it at me, doesn't mean I understand
sorry the subject header was in all caps
and i was too lazy to change it
I was just letting you know the type in case you wanted to see what all the hubbub was about
I still don't get it, no shoes should be that expensive
yea... I'm with you there
I don't even spend that much when I buy multiple pairs of shoes
I mean I think something always falls into that category we just call it "luxury" instead
No focus for a friday afternoon at all :disappointed:

Good morning <@UDDE5960N>
Morning
I have a reminder for right now to ask you about that food tour :stuck_out_tongue:
I'll probably have to bump for next weekend as this weekend is pretty full. The only dietary restriction is meat right?
yes- no allergies or anything :slightly_smiling_face: id still eat chicken if it comes very highly recommended :stuck_out_tongue:
whatre you doing this weekend?
Providence Gay Pride Parade Saturday, Manual labor Sunday

I mean <#CGNP38P52|dnd> has been busy with plots of murdering people afoot
This happens
Yeah, Im also stuck on mobile
A full keyboard is nice, i'm not gonna lie
Yup, and I don't have my phone set up to give me all notifications, so unless im pinged directly I probably won't read it
Ahhh makes sense, my phone does give me notifications for this slack not the wayfair one
Yeah, this phone has notifications for just about everything this slack does.
That's where I was when the infamous @ wars started, walking around copley giggling uncontrollably with mei
The hardest I've laughed over the last few months have much of the time come from this slacks shenanigans
You know what I just thought of
Once we kill the vampire, we can put the entire body in the bag of holding and see what the monster lady will give us
Time to go home!
Time to go home!
If there is a body
THAT WOULD BE SO SAD!!!!!
Did we confirm buying the bag of holding already <@UDDE5960N> and <@UDC4QL95G>?
Yea Dakota has it
And now your post has it because it is holding all of the emoji

Do you want a good morning message, I try to be cognizant of people not wanting an @ so early in the morning?
I'm sure it is, you've just seen that massive list of games I had. Botw being so damn long isn't helping.

so :smash-inkling: is out :banjo:  is in?
New main in the house?
/megamoji Banjo :a_blob_hyper_party:
I dont' understand what is up with deja vu, but there's plenty of room in the house for both :smash-inkling: and :banjo:
Banjo is just my one true love
He looks so perfect!
Like, perfect model
Throwbacks to real moves
Like, the moves he had in the games
Animations on point
Deja vu now has an entire list of everything in this channel and pulls out a random sentence
The specials look fantastic
So it goes back pretty far
I didn't actually watch
OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH
That's new
I forgot
I sometimes get randomly replaced by my bot
Okay
But it was soo good
The music, the stage
The animation
You should watch it
I feel like I need to brush up on my smash now
By the way dave
I'm was listening to banjo music yesterday and this morning to send my positive energy
I do have a gift from you
To Sakurai in getting banjo in
Well Banjo is in buddy
Oh, thanks! I appreciate it. I can pick it up whenever works best for you/I see you next
wait, gfycat didn't give me the option to change it
Yea I have to remember where it got off too
weird
I thought we had problems with gfycat working correctly?
I still just stay with giphy

<@UDBGH9BMX> Why is DK such a big part of BK's intro is it the same franchise?
I thought BK was seperate or is it the fact they're both from Rare?
DK really only became popular becuase of Donkey Kong Country and 64, which were developed by Rare
DK really only became popular becuase of Donkey Kong Country and 64, which were developed by Rare
Diddy is a completley Rare character, and so is K.Rool
And DK64 was pretty much Banjo Kazooie with a lot more bugs, less cool levels, but a ton more stuff to collect
Yea but the start of the video confuses me, you have Mario vs. Browser, Samus vs. Ridley, Link/Zelda vs. Ganon
And then they're like oh, we're going to have DK, Diddy  and K.Rool for BK
And I'm pretty sure there's no reference to that being a single universe
Although DUCK HUNT WAS HILARIOUS!!!!
It's a throwback to the K.Rool reveal vid
Now we just need a banjo threeie
Or even rare replay on PC/Switch. I'll take that too
Sooo, reveal's within reveals

I haven't touched Smash since February. Right when I started playing Breath of the Wild
Drew did you see, Breath of Wild Sequel is in development!
Major's Mask for Breath of Wild
Oh damn! Don't tell Sam. I'm already too obsessed with this game
But that sounds funny now
I can't sit down and play it for less than 2 hours at a time. Multiple instances where at the 2 hour mark I've said "just one more thing" and the next thing I know is it has been 6 hours
Yea... I can see that.  It has a very Civ "One more turn" esq feel
Exactly
Fortunately I'm not a completion whore
I'm not trying to 100% the game
I'm just not trying to cut it short either
I hope the next one is a little more traditional in that aspect
I just went it to be with the effort. From what I can tell, I could go destroy Gannon now, and I've only done 2/4 divine beasts
The divine beasts are fun, and I'm sad theres only 4 of them
Indeed. Bug game world though. Soooooooooo much stuff to discover

Dakota is on vacation?
good morning!
It's like you're not even around anymore drew
He's been gone all week
When you regularly have work nights till 3 in the morning, you stop caring what day of the week it is
See i figured you would care more! because like monday/tuesday would be slow right?
Maybe not?
How are you doing working essential 2nd shift?
I'm adapting. No sense of regularity of schedule so forward planning has been a bit of a problem
I feel like that would bother you
I may have hurt my thumb wiring my new desk, and I have no idea how

from Cop06-T4
BAHAHAHAHAHA
I twisted my hand at a weird angle to plug something in, and felt a weird pop when I pushed
Ewwwwww
might be a pinched nerve, might be something else
but it's annoying
Not fun
I needed to share that, I'm sad I can't find anyone demanding to be amused though
something terrifying/amusing:
something terrifying/amusing:
all the automated red line signals/servers are gone
the derailment yesterday hit the server room
no estimates for the next train
people on the tracks directing trains
people giving each train individual permission to proceed to the next track
slower speeds
no resolution time
Sooooo the red line is no longer just a shit show
now it's an epic shit show
it's _the_ shit show
It is the shittiest show
Oh it does
Damn, that's impressive. Awful, but impressively so
Part of you wonders "who thought this was a good idea"
I'm gonna put servers right here, next to the trains! NOTHING CAN GO WRONG DOING THIS!!!
Anyone interested in joining me at a beer festival on Saturday afternoon (it's based upon sour beers)

<@UDC03KCGK> It's too early for you to be up go back to bed!
<@UDD45P5A9> at least you don't take the red line!
<@UDBV9N1E0> COMMUTER RAIL HO!!!!!!!!
Oh CJ, but I do
<@UHQD9J1SL>
<@UJTEHPEPL> :wave:
Ohhhhhhhhh
Well clearly you're morning things will now refer to that!
I take the green and red, so this week has been fantastic
Work from home an option?
Nope
Probably more effective to walk to work then
Yeah, our world only take 2 hours
How long does it take you now???
With delays a little over an hour, with no delays a little less than an hour
Really even with the red line shit show only an hour?
I'm impressed
That's mainly because I get on at park so in the morning, there ste about the same amount id trains, and I tend to travel just before or gets busy
If I was delayed 10ish minutes, then it would be so much worse
Got it, YEA!!!!! You survive!
Survival is such a vague concept
I mean.... I wouldn't be surprised if you waited the 10 mins it would take you 2 hours instead of 1
That is very close to what would happen
Also, alright chaos seed, a bit weird, but you do you
WE HAVEN"T TRIGGERED IT IN SO LONG!
THE CHAOS GODS HAVE NOT ABANDONED US!!!!!
:chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos:
But I've been up since 7:30...
Seriously we haven't threaded a lot lately. 
Then we got a 150 message thread in <#CGNP38P52|dnd>
Didn't you go to sleep like 3?!?!?!
Off to a coffee shop to do work. My life has been weird lately
That sounds not very bar like
Nah, was watching the Bruins game at home. I have a night shift tonight though followed by a day shift at the restaurant during the day tomorrow. 
Loopy glorious tiger DnD after for the win!
Ophhhh
Did you forget I work 2 jobs?
No, but last I knew you were doing Data entry
Sounds like you're doing something else now
Enlighten me, what are your jobs right now?
heh
That's because it's important to know if we're ok with dying!
I've been doing the bar job and data labeling since the end of April.
So going to the coffee shop is for the data labeling.
Ohhhh I thought you worked in a legit office for the data labeling stuff
I do for some days. But they recognize it can done at home too
Got it, that's why I was confused
Which apparently we are???
I mean, I'd rather not
No worries. My life is confused lately
So...I didn't need that coffee

That episode is amazing
Can we have a Futurama viewing party?
soooo tempting.....
Right???
I also want a Saturday morning cartoons party
Right???
Show up at 10am. The food is all sugary cereal, fruit by the foot, gushers, those ice pops in plastic tubes, etc. The programming involves an episode of every cartoon as voted by the group. Probably having to start with what CJ watched as a kid and moving toward more 90's and 00's stuff like Spongebob and Fairly Odd parents
Nope I don't want to have diabetes that bad
Oh please, any given bender you've had is the same amount of sugar
For reminder sake: "I'M JIGGLIN FOR JUSTICE"

45,000 messages...holy hell
Finally back in the office!
Cool, now tell me what Deja Vu is doing!
When it gives a deja vu trigger in <#CGNP38P52|dnd>, what does that mean???
Nothing
It's not allowed to post there
saturday morning cartoon party sounds like what i need in life
We'll make it happen. Talked to Sam and it sounds like an early September "back to school" thing
<#CGNP38P52|dnd> has turned into Chaos Monkey whenever we are a day or 2 before a play session
We dont get summer breaks though , also- who is Sam?
:gasp:
Sam is my wife
She's not in this channel by choice
Neither is Mei I believe
i didnt know!
Mei asked to join, got an invite and then never did... :disappointed:
Well, that sounds like an open invitation
a coffee shop seems like a great place to get a way from home but still wfh
Well, thanks to this slack, it wasn't productive
Fun and relaxing though
Also you forgot <@UDBGH9BMX> in your good morning today!

yeah that last one is pretty awful
It's all your fault CJ, you said it wasn't creepy enough
It's all your fault CJ, you said it wasn't creepy enough

<@UDBV9N1E0> I wish you luck on your journey to and from the office
<@UDD45P5A9> There will be pizza tonight, you should join us
<@UHQD9J1SL> You're lame because you're still dancing
Um wrong, I'm still dancing because I'm not lame
<@UJTEHPEPL> Only you can be the change you wish to see
<@UDC4QL95G> That proves it, Deja Vu is sentient and we have a problem
I thought you no longer wanted to dance
But why is there pizza...where is there pizza?
Brenden's for :dnd: and because it's Rhode Island style pizza
Rhode island style?
LOOK!!!!! IT"S <@UK7V13DS7>!!!!!!
<@UDC4QL95G> SHE DOESN"T GET A CHOICE ADD HER TO THE MAYHEM!!!!!
I actually just add all the pizza

Did you get yourself a slice of white or did you forget?
I already did
Now you all get to experience what I live with day to day
This is my single favorite line from any Adam Sandler Movie Period
I smite thee
:disappointed:
<@UDDE5960N> this is deeeeep AF
What movie?
What movie?
Billy Madison
Oh. Haven't seen that one of all movies
UNLEASH THE CLOPIN!
I want to know more about why this exists.
WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU!
Oh yes, it is fully sentient
CLOPIN?
There's a lot of good movies to watch
Why wouldn't it exist?
There's a cult to pizza?
Yea, but this is been out forever and it's one the reason we still have Adam Sanders movie to this day
Happy Madison Productions!
Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison
There's a cult for everything these days
Is it really a style? They just make them slightly larger and cut it in squares instead of triangles
<@UDDE5960N>
Close to open. Worked till 3am, back at work for a day shift at 10 am. Some people pronounce it "clo-pin" but I think it is funnier as analagous to Kracken
The price is wrong, bitch
There's a cult for everything these days
<@UDDE5960N>; thoughts?
One of us, one of us, one of us!
HAHAHAHA so good
You subject yourself to this
Ahhhhhh got it, this is your day shift now
This is true
But I'm evil so she amuses me
Yeah, but not for the data labeling. This is a day shift at the restaurant receiving alcohol orders from distributors and making syrups
This is known
I do not miss Clopins
I assume if we're talking day shift it's for the restaurant
<@UDDE5960N>; thoughts?
I just can't stop staring at this gif
Works for me. Anyway, it is the reason I can make DnD tonight. Also means I didn't have a real breakfast so I hope there is a LOT of pizza.
I just can't stop staring at this gif
Did you wait tables <@UDD45P5A9>?
I did other retail, not food service
Bad in many similar and different ways
Ah, got it.
Doesn't feel like a Friday to me
But glad you all can chill out!
Yeah... working non traditional hours is not fun
<@UDC03KCGK> dunno if this is enough
But we can get you more food too if you need it
:hy::pe:
The only real downside is I've had it since tuesday so it's not bakery fresh :disappointed:
ummmm..... no..... You eat it room temp!
Just saying bake goods are always better the day their made!
we're talking about pizza, correct?
Yes, but it's differnt
You can warm it up if you want afterwards
sometimes CJ sends a morning message that strikes so deep :smile: its like reading a daily horoscope
is that sicilian style?
That looks like not enough for the number of people
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_tomato_pie>
There's 5 of us, you get 20% of the pizza, that's why I'm saying if you're going to be starving, we should probably get something else too
There are benefits, like being able to walk into places during normal working hours and not having to rush
what else do we want?
I will also probably get a bottle of sake on the way, but those will be my contributions!
Ehhhhh it's whatever mood i'm in for the morning

<@UK7V13DS7> say hi!
You do realize the log captures the userid if you @ someone right? Mei is &lt;@UK7V13DS7&gt;
HI HI HI HI HI
You're not Mei Aysh!
Or is she????
This feels like a sting
Or the twilight zone
lol
nope didn't realize that
well now you do!

ok......
Deja Vu can now pick from 5916 different messages
that is just code that is still active in prometheus
6000 messages
NICE!
Soon we'll be a point that prometheus is messaging things we can't see anymore
4000 messages left to go!
KINKY V KINKY!
no reaction. Kinda confused
The react message was deleted
ohhh cuz it happend to make your message a bot
that still throws me off
You only have yourself to blame for this problem
Lol. I've upped all RNG caused by Mei by 10% (Additive) for being the first non-wayfairian in the channel
Oh yea... she is
How interesting
/megamoji mei :chaos:
Ohhhh I like that, I wonder if it works on mobile too
IT DOES!
its pretty short, it might look decent
also I didn't really add to her rng, turned out to be a bit more troublesome than I would have preferred
HAHAHAHAHA
Yo Dakota, do you want to play The Grizzled at 3 with me and our OPI PM?
EEK
but did you laugh?
Yes, yes I did Aysh
sure
Can you find the big kitchen on your own or do I need to come find you?
idunno man i might get lost
That's what I'm afraid of! You always say that struggle to find the rooms on 3
Well the rooms are harder to find than the kitchen
LOL!

looks like I did break it
I almost feel the need to create a "Brenden was here" bot
Nah I found a bug
you can say that again
you can say that again
you can say that again
you can say that again
you can say that again
you said that?
only two responses for 4 prompts
seems weird
suspiciously relevant
in threads it just checks for a matching user in the second to las post. If that post has no user, then it returns
so if a bot posts twice in a row, it messes up
I think
so we need to get :dejavu: and you can say that again to trigger at the same time?
or just have cj talk
yeah. Or just spam quickly like you did before
you can say that again
????
Ok i changed how it worked
you can say that again
it now looks for the most recent valid message
From a non-bot?
yup
non bot and not "you can say that again"
I agree Freidman highly suspect we'll survive
Dakota with the total party kill
of course
you can say that again

hmm
4 Tanks and doug isn't trying to kill us

Creepy
there we are
<@UDC4QL95G> that's not a bug?

I'll probably grab a bite to eat beforehand. I'm done with my shift and headed that way.
It's sentient, we know this
Lot to catch up on today. This always happens when Dakota is testing code
Or fixing code
I'll ping you when I'll be home
That's ok
that's very normal in this channel
Lol I feel like that should be said while patting my head or something 
:headpat:
Phew I feel better 
glad to hear it
just accept the chaos and move on
:man-walking:moving on 
Lazy good morning!
Summon the silent
Where do the phrases come from for 'summon the silent'?
<@UJTEHPEPL>
The stars do not know you.
Prepare. They too, have teeth.
Dakota and I made them up
Love how morbid they are
<@UETS9HTSS> <@UHQD9J1SL> Take a random one from each sections and you get a summon the silent saying
I would like to believe some cosmic entity is causing this sentient application to send me personalized greetings every morning, thank you
They're suppose to be ominous
Can we add to this list?
I'm not sure Dakota's is ominous, just seems like fact really
Well, we've already determined Prometheus is sentient. The algorithm for the phrase combos is part of that
I would also like to add things
You know where to go to add things you're in the right channel
you can say that again
hmmmm not quite right. The command apparenly reads from threads
Crickets here. Anything but in Dnd

I'm on the rotation where when people ask me to do ad-hoc work, I just get to say "No. I'm on X rotation."
lol
It's great :ok_hand:
I'm guessing the rotation is one of the easier one's too, because I know you don't get to do that for criticals
Although, i think all criticals work is literally adhoc
Screw peer feedback and performance reviews
Screw peer feedback and performance reviews
Too much stress Dave?
Too much stress Dave?
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the performance reviews are still shitty as a process
Too much work on top of your normal workload
I mean for the most part this week is a lost week for me
Upward, self and peers, and then next week is downward

WOOOO HOOOOO

IT IS STILL NOT DEPLOYED

there is a "Disk Space Issue" that has stopped ALL DEPLOYS

Because they suck

They're not as customizable as power point
Why do you need the full customization of powerpoint?
And execs are a pain in the ass with their "I want it this way regardless of how much sense it makes!"
Oh
:oh:
execs are a good reason to hate google slides
Yea.... so customization to fit things on a page that should never be there is nice
I was told we were making a trade off on collaboration over quality!
were you aware of the google drive url shortcuts?
&gt;&gt;&gt;`docs.new`
`sheets.new`
`slides.new`
`forms.new`
THIS WAS NOT WHAT I WAS PROMISED!
No that's neat though
clearly the execs were not willing to sacrifice some quality

There go my weekend plans
Ohhh Aysh Mei is scared of <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> and is planning on making a food channel fyi
usually not, its just dedicated fans usually
<@UETS9HTSS> feels left out!
she will not escape prometheus
she will not escape prometheus
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE NOW!
that's why Summon the Silent exists
No one can
Unless they opt out
<@UETS9HTSS> You provide the stability that everyone depends on!
TA DA!
:tada:
True, but summon the silent is ominous where as these are uplifting
Mine doesn't exactly feel super uplifting...
I mean I have to help you embrace the chaos
Also DnD has felt more chaotic than chaos monkey this week
That's uplifting, it's just not what you want to hear
2 session essentially days apart does that
I don't have a problem with it, just that it technically isn't uplifting. Statement of fact really.
I wonder how often regular sessions are suppose to last
usually a minimum of 3 hours
i'd say 3-5 hours is normal
some groups go longer
I'm just gonna make the ominous statement generator run without summon the silent.  AND THAT'S ALL YOU GET NOW!
another PC in my sunday group does a Saturday campaign that's something like 1pm to 9pm
Yea but like 3 hours once a week?
3-5 hours once per week, yes
So we're running at half to less of a normal group
the fear will mold her
'_normal_'
some groups meet monthly
" _normal_ "
some meet bi-weekly
some meet weekly
some meet whenever their schedules line up
Weekly would be great, but hard to manage.
Given our progress at bi-weekly I hope the monthly groups are like all day affairs
usually they are longer sessions
Well I'll just have to embrace it
'progress'?
'progress'?
Well, we're on day 3 in game
And we've had 2 characters die
And we've been going since april?
Sooo we roughly complete a day a month
And someone dies every day so far
such excite
to be fair, this much death is unusual
We have however made it to level 4! So we got that!
I'm not saying that she is forcibly oped into chaos, but her association with CJ means she cannot be immune form bots by simply avoiding <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
MU HAHAHAHAHAHAH
There's totally going to be a Mei only bot
It doesn't have to be. You could give it a 25% chance to be a happy message
Maybe, but that's going to require some coding, and I like the fact that when I summon the silent they get an ominous message for not participating

I seriously do not get the people who sell Monthly passes on Nonwork.  There's a pass for zone 6 they're trying to sell it for $300 original value $340.  I can buy Zone 7 daily passes for $140 WHY WOULD ANYONE PAY YOU THAT!?!?!

<@UDDE5960N> what do you mean selling for July? 
<@UDDE5960N> what do you mean selling for July? 
Zone 6 is pass is being sold for 300.  Usual people on non work are idiots and would try and sell a June pass at that price today
lol would laugh so hard if they are trying to sell for June like the people before. $300.... zone 6 no
yes i do :slightly_smiling_face:
There was some angry ranting that I deleted
Created new channel <#CKQ4NGF24|food>  :slightly_smiling_face:
whats the point  of downtime when reviews are due?
Alright CJ I need a bot idea for Mei
or <@UDC03KCGK> since his ideas are ususally good
After she comments, 5% chance it does some kind of a search for the phrase she typed and "recipes" and posts a link to the recipe
Wow dave you do not aim small do you?
<@UDC03KCGK> You better still be sleeping!
<@UDC4QL95G> You better not still be sleeping!
<@UETS9HTSS> You are not forgotten!
<@UDD45P5A9> You should be riding the train!
<@UDBV9N1E0> You should be cursing the MBTA!
<@UHQD9J1SL> You should be cursing your fate that your awake!
<@UJTEHPEPL> You should be wondering if it was a good idea to join us
<@UDBGH9BMX> You should love me like one of your french girls!
One of my best not horrible decisions in life 
good morning!  i love this weather- its perfect for staying indoors and drinking coffee
i didnt know water quality in new england is that bad
Lol 
also- my home town is out of water.
like-people BUYING tankers of water.
It is sad
<https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/india/chennai-water-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html>

There, I vented.
Oh shit 
That is horrible :confused:
Bitter predictor of what is come though :disappointed:
the state the 2nd highest gdp in the country, but the government ignores it because we speak a different language from the center. Rerouted rivers and leased out water to - i kid you not- Pepsi. Rivers out, Ground water out, and rains fail.

Ok im done for real
I mean Aysh, you're allowed to vent, I would probably argue this is a safe space
i suually hold back because i think my information is one sided :slightly_smiling_face:
My bigger concern is to your point this is exacerbated by the government it's a real sign of the scary things that are going to come out of SE Asia
I'd second this is a safe space and if you want or need to vent, go for it
To me this is the canary in the coal mine, it's no longer hypothetically, climate change is driving real unrest as areas that were livable are no longer
i cannot understand the HOW of climate change denial. Question- did you guys learn about it in school? green houses gases and global wrming etc?
Because people don't want to change
It's the same as the response to smoking "It hasn't killed me yet"
Also it becomes a question of schooling, you're talking to i would argue rather educated people.  So yes we did learn it
But the people who aren't, they just believe the talking head, who knows they're lying
It's very hard to explain to someone with very little knowledge, that the world going up 1 or 2 degress is going to make our part of the country actually COLDER
As someone who did the majority of my education in the south, I'd say I was not taught climate change as a child, but learned about it as an adult
I'm from the North East so you'll have a better position than I
its curious the difference in attitudes- in India if someone is relatively less educated, they will take the word of the learned as gospel. (this lends itself to being manipulated by quacks and God-men)
It sounds like here, any attempt to teach is met with indignation- again, i have very very little exposure
thats unfortunate~
I mean, I'm just agreeing, this group knows the truth, but many outside the group do not
isnt that why it was renames 'climate change' from 'global warming'?
Correct, but the concept here is that people who can't figure out how to use credit cards, don't have a chance in hell of understanding weather systems
I am not nor was I despite getting to bed around 2:30am
I think it was taught but not reinforced 
Yes, even in my podunk home town it was taught in school. Pretty straight forward concept that was repeated quite a few times. 
Sadly, I would bet half my class would deny climate change.
What does the north east imply <@UDDE5960N>?
North East tends to have better general schooling.  The one exception is probably where you're from Drew
I've found that here people look at common sense as a sign of intelligence before knowledge or education, at least for the more rural communities. So the instant you show yourself to be odd or not understand something so fundamental as to how to start a fire or drive on a gravel road, you're looked up doubtfully, despite being able to explain nuclear fission or program a computer. 
(Oh, and if you think those 2 things aren't "fundamental" that's kind of the point of how ridiculous it gets)
If you take a 6th grader in the different regions, a 6th grader in the north east will "typically" outperform
Oh no I agree, the way you said made it sound like New England taught the wrong outlook on global warming.
And no, my schooling is not up to par with the North East. Better than the South for the most part, but nothing I would call stellar or ground breaking.
Honestly Rich, sometimes it's not even taught, there's a big problem with evolution vs. creation in some locations.  This won't even classify
Yea, my point is that Victoria is going to have a much better sense for.... lack of intellectualism than I ever will.  I mean URI is a good school that's looked down upon because it's next to brown, MIT, and Harvard
What's wrong with southern education? Just because I was taught creationism, global warming is a conspiracy theory, and the war of northern agression....
Um, that
Sarcasm
You make me happy Victoria
For me it's hard to understand the level of ignorance because I grew up in essentially the intellectual powerhouse of the US
I'm glad I can make you happy CJ
I knew I was ignorant when I came to mass for college, but wasn't aware how ignorant I was
I mean, I would add driving in snow personally, crucial skill for anyone
Where did you go in Mass for college again? I keep forgetting :(
Well, we didn't have snow. We had lots of rain, so I'm always confused why rain causes traffic problems here. To me that was just "driving."
And the flip side to this convo, is the disdain that intellectuals have turns off people to listening to them.  I see a lot of holier than thou speeches that no one but the choir will ever listen too
Or people forcing upon plastic straw bans instead of actual regulations to industry that would have more tangible impact...
The plastic straw ban is hilarious
you're not going to have major corporations lobbying against plastic straw bans
that's the difference in my head
I mean it comes down to the basic, why do we do our taxes, because some else profits from it
I went to Suffolk in Boston, not a good school by a long shot
Still better than anything near you?
But you get the holier than though happy about it as "saving the planet" and it absolutely alienates the small town folk into thinking the dumb liberals from the city don't know nothing. 
It's a lose lose
Bingo
This bothers me so much
But it's culminates in everything that annoys everyone
Actually no, the Universities are actually really well ranked. I just needed to get out of the south while I had the chance
Fair enough
Yeah, I totally get that. I didn't think of Suffolk as a bad school
Oh it's a shit school, honestly surprised with how much they're able to get away with
Such as?
They're still accredited which I don't know how as they have a reputation of graduating students who are proven to be incapable of being successful in the work force
I mean that's a lot of schools, the more terrifying part is how bad do you have to be to NOT get accredited!
Like the people who fail the TOEFL
My freshmen year roommates had gpas less than 2.5 and were accepted and honestly one of them worked her ass off to succeed and the other didn't and still graduated
School is what you make of it, people just don't want to accept that.  Also school is more about connections than material.
I'd agree, but if the professors can't teach and the textbooks are written by the professors, it's hard to make much from it
That is vomit inducing
That is Suffolk, yay! :tada:
My high school's biology teacher enthusiastically taught evolution but also lead prayers where she promised God that we would stay celibate until wedlock.
This reminds me of the community college in community. Only because Ive been binge watching the show again. Also because its awesome and meta and hilarious.
Anyway to me this comes down to classes
The rich want more and the best way to get it is to keep people ignorant and pliable
Which is why I think Aysh's article is a harbinger of... more terrifying things
I AM THE HERALD OF HELL
Yes... you are
Ummmm that's dark Aysh
teeheehehehehehehhe
She did say she's the herald of hell, seems on point tbh
I wasn't expecting her to be soo.... competent at it
No faith CJ
Limited faith
If your professor wrote the textbook, 9 times out of 10 you are in for a bad time.
1. They will make you buy it
2. They will assume you know the material before you read it
3. They probably weren't hired because of their teaching talent

easy, just stop doing taxes
You know there's a guy who has asked for the law that says you have to do income taxes
FYI, no one has claimed it yet
That was always the case. I generally just dropped classes where the professor wrote the book. Only exception to that was my Spanish textbook

That one is kinda funny
Unless it's a required course and the only professor who teaches it... y'all don't ever go to a small school

Yup, BC was not OSU or UMass sized, but it was still 9800 undergrads
I think URI was a graduating class of 1,000
I think URI was a graduating class of 1,000
For the record the physics department only had like 10 teachers max... and like 10 students sooo... It was like a little school
But no one is that.... crazy in physics

People really don't think through looks
Someone posted about how we have a new way to communicate, and they posted a slack help channel.... It's been around around for a month with exactly 1 person in it
Seems... popular and useful!
There's a new way to communicate?
We have an internal communications playbook because clearly we have too many people to effectively share our knowledge
it's not that they don't understand. It's not good for business.
Eh, the people saying it is not good for business only represent the upper echelon of business owners etc. 
There's a whole group of farmers or blue collar workers that just flat out deny it because look at how it is colder rather than warmer or we've been having bad weather for years, just look at the hurricanes of '66 or the tsunamis of the past.

Apparently Wayfair sells bunk beds to the Concentration Camps on the border. RE: #nonwork_politics
DAMN!!!!!
That's a fun topic to watch people discuss
This is going to be the wayfair sells guns cases and safes discussion of 2016 all over again
Too much idealism for me in that thread. "By not selling them stuff they'll stop!!!"
No, you'll just be making the conditions more inhumane. And then it becomes a question of what makes you feel better, not being involved or helping people
its a very difficult thing to take a stance on
I don't think so, if we care they we'll fund the injunction lawyers. Until then we do our best to make things comfortable. Would you stop setting up water or sewage for these locations?
He did say that! ITS SENTIENT!
Lazy Good Morning!

Something Something ominous  saying
To the style of robot chicken's something something darkside
Bye Dave...
Bye Dave...
WHO DID WHAT
Wait, j thought j removed Dave from that...
Bye Dave...
Nobody, Dave doesn't like being pinged randomly, alparently j failed to remove him from summon the silent
Something indeed
Something indeed
Dave comes and goes as he pleases
Correct me if I'm wrong: isn't there a setting you can put for a slack or even a channel that avoids getting notifications for pings?
Correct me if I'm wrong: isn't there a setting you can put for a slack or even a channel that avoids getting notifications for pings?
Ehhhhhhh
Yes but it's easier to leave I guess?
I mean leaving a channel is super easy. I just thought slack literally have settings for this
people are lazy
I didn't think you can stop slack from notifying you if you are pinged directly but only in one channel
you can mute @here and @everyone separately or you can turn off all notifications
You can also turn off notications that are not @you
Well I think it is more like he wants notifications, but only when something is relevant
so turning them off doesn't solve that issue
BUT HE DOESN'T LOVE US ANYMORE!
Leaving the channel means we have to seek him out specifically in other channels
Or just invite him back
I STILL HAVE THAT POWER!
lol thats how you get him to leave the entire slack group
<https://giphy.com/gifs/powerrangers-farkasbulkmeier-bulk-powerrangers-mightymorphin-mmpr-Jbh3QodUkEIkU>
Agreed
But just saying if we want him we can just invite him back here
I don't see how that would be any different. You can literally go channel by channel and set whether you want notifications or not
I don't see how that would be any different. You can literally go channel by channel and set whether you want notifications or not
So if he doesn't want direct pings in a channel...what would he want to be notified about in that channel?
You can separately set an overarching rule for the entire slack. That's still separate from say your preferences for the Wayfair Slack
I don't see how that would be any different. You can literally go channel by channel and set whether you want notifications or not
If he were to ignore pings in this channel, we would continue pinging him willy-nilly
If I text you at 2am, is it my responsibility to be cognizant of when you are or are not up? Or is it your responsibility to set the notification preferences that work for you for your phone?
Right, but if we are pinging him willy nilly and he isn't getting notifications...what's the problem?
Cleary I'm just going to depend on my ability to sleep through any notification at 2 am
It is the case of the boy who cried wolf
and since there is no chance of relevant pings in this channel, I imagine he would rather not desensitize himself to pings that will inevitably appear in this channel
especially since muting notification does not suppress the little red badge on the left that lets you know you were pinged
By existing in this channel, he sees the badge saying he has a notification in the external slack group, and comes over to see it is garbage
I've never once got the impression the problem was the badge. Just that the message popped up on his screen while a manager or other high ranking person was viewing his screen
Because I can make sure I get pings from <#CGNP38P52|dnd> but not pings from <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
The only thing I can't is as you said, the red badge
Please try pinging me in <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
and then again in <#CGNP38P52|dnd>
i really hope this is a test...
<@UDC03KCGK>
The other person viewing his screen thing is also something that he has said in the past, but he also said specifically that he only wanted to be pinged when we actually want his attention in general, though this may have been in  a DM
pretty sure it was a DM
Ummmmm.... I doubt it because they didn't tell us how to reprot it
Can you try one more time in Chaos Monkey? have to close the thread first
OH MAN THEIR GOING TO SEND A LETTER
I kinda want to join #nonwork-politics for the sheer evil enjoyment
<@UDC03KCGK>
<@UDC03KCGK>
<@UDC03KCGK>
<@UDC03KCGK>
Keep going
<@UDC03KCGK>
<@UDC03KCGK>
<@UDC03KCGK>
<@UDC03KCGK>
Ok we're good on the ping testing
<@UDC03KCGK>
Are you sure <@UDC03KCGK>
I mean you can keep going, it won't bother me as evidenced in the past
Treu
But I got the relevant data I needed
Which is!?!!?
So yeah, even with all notifications off, pings still show up as red badges
So I mean if that's his problem, I am sympathetic to it. But if it is about cards popping up on your computer screen...that's on him
About the okta prompt or selling bunk beds to the border?
Bed on the border
So I just got some interesting news
The okta thing is a legit problem
OHHHHHHHHHHHH!?!?!?!?!?
My team is being dissolved
I swear it's sentient
Then yeah JOIN #nonwork-politics
Also I don't know if I would call that interesting
That right there is a Wayfair story that gets brought up time and again over the next couple years!
Like all of comp intel?
I'm not being laid off or anything
Or just your part of it?
I may join engineering actually
Just my immediate team
not all of compintel
That sounds like an upgrade
though they're doing some re-org too
it is most certainly an upgrade
Sooo they're basically moving you over to a different team? All your team?
They keep telling me not to tell you Drew, BUT I"M NOT LISTENING!!!!!
Hahaha, oh the dirty laundry of major corporations
No; I have a bit of a unique opportunity here
the rest will be joining other teams
It's like when they pulled ads for some of the Fox News shows and people were more like "Why were you buying ads there to begin with?"
I have those options, but our partner engineering team was interested in me
Ahhhhh got it
Damn giphy not working in threads
Based on what I heard if engineering wants you go there
You just need to copy the link and post it here
Yeah, I asked to be thrown in the co-op trainings for our partner engineering team
a letter for what?
Oh did you miss last night's convo
<https://media.giphy.com/media/mKd879xTnFNSw/giphy.gif>
apparently
<https://media.giphy.com/media/mKd879xTnFNSw/giphy.gif>
Wayfair is selling bunk beds to the concentration camps on the border, and some people have problems with that
on the border of what?
Thanks CJ
The mexico border
if we don't sell them beds, someone else will
or they'll go to ikea
Sppphhhhh you people are too nice
Or they won't buy beds at all
they're clearly not ethical, THEY'LL MAKE THEM SLEEP ON THE GROUND
didn't think of that
And this is why you'll never make a good evil mastermind, because that was pretty much the first thought that came to my head
This feel like the super low stakes version of "Guns don't kill people"
This is more like the low stakes of should I provide you water
welcome
So is congrats more appropriate? 
I mean you are pretty technical Brenden, making the jump shouldn't be difficult.  The bigger question is do you want to go down a tech or business route?
possibly? this is still months off
I think since I have the option open, I'll be going the engineering route
The pay is better there, and it has always interested me anyway
Make sense, engineer's are treated much nicer here
I just didn't have the training for it
It's weird either way. I obviously don't support the camps. But am I supposed to get mad at the hardware store that someone went and bought a bunch of materials to build the fences from? Or company that sold them food?
Like prisoner's dilemma, but the participants aren't even aware they are part of the game in the first place
Yes! Because clearly starving them is the ethical choice, it'll totally make the bad men stop!
This is just people trying to feel morally superior regardless of outcomes
Which is stupid
Like I see the argument of "If you don't supply them, they can't operate." But that requires a ridiculous banding of groups all refusing to sell to this. Even if they all agreed (they wouldn't), what is stopping a bunch of random border patrol people going to grocery stores and buying food. The grocery store can't tell for what it will be used for.
Once again you're thinking the people you're interacting with will act ethically EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE PROVEN NOT TO
What's to stop them from just denying food, or giving the prisoners seeds and saying good luck?
I'm just saying even if they were all ethical, and all agreed on this being bad. Even if you get past that major hurdle, you'd still unwittingly be supplying them
No you're saying the vendor's are being ethical, I'm referring to the owners
Why not just have a land of survival of the fittest, cannibalism solves a lot of problems
That's my point
The owners of? I edited my comment above for clarity
Still wrong audience, the owners of the camp
Oh yeah, I get that point entirely
At the end of the day, until you can deal with that, withholding things will just make life shittier for the people you're "helping" which is why it's "moral superiority" regardless of outcomes
I'm just focusing on the immediate reaction of "Wayfair shouldn't sell to them"
Ok 1) It's pretty easy to unwittingly supply them anyway
2) If Wayfair refuses, what have you actually solved? You can politically posture for moral high ground? You haven't actually fixed anything
We're on the same page
2 is more the point I'm on
I think pulling ad dollars from a show that says horrible things makes more sense. Not a ton more, but at least there you have a more direct impact
I refuse to sponsor a show -&gt; show dies without sponsors
Can they find other sponsors? Sure. They can't unwittingly force you to be part of a business exchange though
Or am I just practicing cognitive dissonance right now?
One sec walking
you're confusing willingness to participate with your impact on operations
In this example it would be the same as saying I'm not longer willing to pay taxes until the camps are gone
Or a hairstylist refusing to work for fox
One has real impact on their ability to conduct operations, one is a token gesture at best
huh- thats an interesting development. Glad youre in a good place but how isthe rest of the team taking it?
So it comes down to impact?
So it comes down to impact?
Camps getting beds: low impact
Show not getting ad support: high impact?
Ehhh more like Camps not getting bed, camp can still run.  Show with no funds people stop showing up to work
I have been on 7 teams over my time at wayfair, and each time was because of random and sudden re-orgs. Wayfair is really fond of just totally dispersing teams.
How long have you been here dakota?
like 2.7 years
That's specific
well its a bit over 2.5
Sooo roughly &lt;6 months per team
That sounds... annoying
this is making me feel things- how is this different from that bakery that refused to sell a cake for a couple's wedding because they were same-sex?
I dont agree with the camps and their functioning but is this being hypocritical?
I don't know if India has "protected classes" but the US does.  There are certain things you're never allowed to use as a criteria for making business decisions.
Gender is one, I don't think sexuality is..... but the cake more closely aligns with that.  In that you're not allowed to judge people based on x vs. we believe this is wrong and we're taking a stand against it
to you're point, it's a grey line, but we do have a precedence for both
Unions vs. protected classes
hmmm! so there is a difference in the legality of it.
Yea, Gender, race, disability, religion
i dont know if this is true, but someone mentioned the orders were furnishing the people working at the camps and not the detainees.
I think that's all of them....?
*age?
I mean if you want to make the workers suffer sure, that'll have more of an impact
But if it's for the detainees, that's more of a "I'm a good person regardless of who pays" to me
eh typically the team dissolves as soon as the work gets "boring"
It keeps things interesting at the very lest
So basically you solved a  problem and they get rid of the team, there's got to be a better way of handling that
then, we're dissolving this team
yup. Each time another team will come to me or the pms runnign the team with a request and we will be like, sorry we are a new team now
and they will ask who to contact about getting the change done, and we respond. Nobody
That's even better!
Now that this is fix we're going to let it languish until it becomes a problem again!
if this gets out - and we cancelled the order or diverted profits to a good cause and publicized it, itll probably be really good PR for wayfair
:lol:
<@UHQD9J1SL> the rest of the team doesn't know yet
I was told because of the engineering thing
ooooooooh
oh no
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
He's not here he doesn't get notice
<@UDC4QL95G> kill :bane:
I think the rest find out by Tuesday though
This whole thing is sad, they already got shut down once
JESUS CHRIST!!!!! What a useless response...  I despise people like her
they "got shut down once"?
what channel is that screencap from?
@nonwork-politics
you have so much power right noiw
And they already brought this up to leadership to be told "We're not dealing with this"
imagine taking the profits and diverting them projects that aid refugees? :smile: snarky max
Snarky max is using the profits to fund the lawyers who sue for an injunction to make this stop now
And then the stuff they bought doesn't even get used
or that- yes
We need a sentience emoji
Found it
I was told not to talk about it until I get the green light
Yea pretty much
Man i love watching people argue in slack. My work productivity is gettin real close to 0 today
yea... and I have to do these stupid reviews!
same
i'll probably do them sunday night
I may end up finishing them on sunday
I would like to avoid that, I do not have faith in systems
Na i still laugh every time i see it
Also there's so much that goes into that silly little bot
IT SHALL OUTLIVE ALL OF US!
its a 1/1000 chance as well
And only in threads
Awww that politics people finally ran out of steam.  I can't wait to see what happens after 3:30
Im hoping something shows up in nonwork
I wonder if the internet is gonna find out
I like how they had to tell people a day later to not share with outsiders, like a bit late wayfair pr
They said it a bunch of times, not that I'm gonna listen to them
That one isn't as good
Dudes like "lets just quit the bullshit"
This is totally about people just making themselves feel better, not actually doing anything
```I don't want this to go down without at least being on the record that I said no```
No to what? What option did you offer up?
It'd be interesting to see what office the people who are causing the biggest fuss are in
Well the lady brining causing the most fuss is a on
`3d Viz Artist`
`XII`?
jeeze
probably said no to that poll
how many are there?
15
what channel is that in?
#nonwork-politics
channel is amazing today
yea, this is some good :popcorn: watching today
I miss wayfair drama
THAT'S GOOD SHIT!!!
Seems like it's the data viz people, which is probably why they're getting ignored
LOL to the red line train joke
I imagine the people being vocal in that channel are being far more vocal in person
the whole team is probably on a rampage at this point
```The Sub home tap is the only way to enjoy beers from Hopsy's award winning brewery partners on draft, in your home.  Say goodbye to dusty bottles and cas and drink your beer the way brewers wanted you to: fresh and on tap.'''
Does kegs improve freshness in a way i'm not aware of? I thought it was just the fact that you consume kegs at a quicker rate!
I believe it is supposed to
I don't understand how the sealing process for a keg is going to be better than for a bottle or can/ why not just do that on a smaller scale?
inherently kegs aren't any better than cans, they are better than bottles though
Google says kegs are "fresher"
it tends to be that bars go through kegs faster than cans get consumed
so yes, in the wild kegs would likely be fresher
but we're making a lot of assumptions
like that this beer is good enough that people drink it fast
I'm pretty sure kegs being fresher is a marketing ploy
or that the bar is busy and so they need to change kegs often
Another argument is that if you are going to be drinking from a bottle, you may as well buy it yourself. If you are at a bar, at least experience the beer differently
a can and a keg that are both one day old are the same
bottles are the inferior beer storage methodology
what about cans
Really? Why?
bottles let in light, which causes beer to become lightstruck aka skunked
Ahhhhhh
It probably did that on purpose to convince us that it is actually a bot
there is a new 64 message thread that somehow diverged into gender and quality of school
Also
Yea...  that place is scary
Dakota you broke my chaos monkey
huh same person apparently posted the document in #nonwork-bos with an `@here`. the channel has 1200 people in it
yep
her post quickly got buried by disgruntled people annoyed by the :ath::ere:
I sonder if it goes over images
Nope
it does on my screen
WTF are you doing?
Why would anybody be so bugged about being pinged <@UDC03KCGK>
just copy and paste what I did
you can use it anywhere in slack
now its read
it's now in #nonwork-polls they're really being annoying about this shit
oh man i gotta check that out
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!!?
you can copy and past that
WHY IS THERE RED!?!?
I DON"T WANT IT!
Nope
I surrounded those by bactics
it's awful
lol dejavu?
hello?
You broke dejavu with it!

lol prometheus doesn't like unicode apparently
I'm down with selling the beds
I think i am in the minority here though
I'm one of the `Yes` people
lol
Prometheus told you off
I don't really care if we sell them beds
We're a business; we sell stuff
our stuff isn't used to hurt people
Clearly you've never been beaten with a pillow relentlessly by small children
The poll is clearly biased in its wording
I mean they have a clear bias but they can't accept that in others
should we stop selling knives cuz people use them to kill people?
Did you see the rounded knife articles? They were hilarious
No?
also they still havn't sent out a nonwork email
<https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-44278556>
lol im pretty sure my knives at home aren't very good at stabbing
TWICE IN ONE DAY
Sorry this one is better
<https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/27/knives-sharp-filing-solution-soaring-violent-crime-judge-says/>
Is my favorite line
Clearly people aren't going for wrists inner leg or neck with the slashes because you know that's generally pretty fatal
Pretty quickly too
I mean I imagine it wouldn't be all that effective to slash people with knives
you would really have to go to town on the guy to get them out of the fight quickly. Shank'em a few times though? easy
Short answer is that stabbing is easier than slashing, but it doesn't mean that when you take it away that people won't start slashing
Depends on how your defining, I mean it's generally the pain that's debilitating, but you really don't "die" that easy
where as slashing major arteries is going to kill you faster
true, but i imagine slashing an artery on the inner thigh is pretty tough, same with inner arm. and the kind of people who are walking around stabbing people probably aren't gonna ninja up behind somebody to slash their throat
Maybe, it's probably the fact that stabbing causes higher trauma than slashing that makes it harder to treat
I'm pretty sure if you went slashy slashy that people wouldn't put up that much more fight
bonus points is it's less likely to get stuck so you're attacker is more likely to keep control with slashing motions
I think most knife crimes are just a few sudden stabs and running away. its not like 2 people are squaring up and fighting.

Slashy slashy and run away is gonna be way less likely to kill you unless you get them in the throat
like... what do you even aim for?
you probably aren't even gonna get a good cut unless you get them on the arms or something
Alright, valid you need more knowledge of anatomy to do serious damage
I mean, you'll get a good cut, the thing is it's easier for medics to treat because it's near the surface
Rather than the deeper trauma from a stab
First aid can do more for slash
I dont really think so. without a point, you have to get a good angle on whatever you are hitting
if you are f acing the dude, if the tip of your knife is dull and rounded, how are you gonna get the edge of the knife on anything but his outer arms
Knife isn't dull, the point is
even if you do, get that angle, that cut is gonna be super shallow
The knife is still gonna cut just fine
true but think of the angle.
Shape edge don't need angle dakota, they just need to go back and forth
If there is a tree in front of you, imagine slashing it with the knife, but only hit the front of the tree
what part of the knife hits the tree?
I mean wild swings with a knife against a tree is going to hit the blade
yeah, on the sides of the tree. any swings that hit the front of the tree will be very close to the tip of the knife
The stabbing action is more innate because of the way our arms work, but that doesn't mean that i'm come after you with something like a butcher knife you're going to live
And that has no points
Am i gonna need to come down there and demonstrate how slashing a person works
lol
alright a bucher knife is basically an axe, and that is not the kinda knife we are talking about here
we are talking about knives that are currently used for stabbing
yes, but the concept of why a butcher's knife is scary still holds
Less momentum so it won't go as deep
But it'll still cut
without the heft of a butcher knife, using a normal kitchen knife like you would a butcher's knife is gonna be way less effective
I'll agree, but it still shows the effectiveness of the edge for purpose of our conversation
man we talking about dulling the point of a sword, and you say just smack'm with a mace
tottally different weapons
The part of a sword that kills is the blade not the point
That's why in :dnd: long swords are slash
yeah, but swords are a bit bigger
the part of a dagger that kills is the point
There are swords for stabbing
Ehhhhhhh
outside of stealth,  you never see people slashing people with daggers
a dagger without a point is just a broken sword
I guess if you want to go down that path, I'm just saying that here is a country with low gun violence that is complaining about too many stabbings
And people think that if I remover the tool, I'll stop it, people find a way
<https://giphy.com/gifs/help-jeff-goldblum-faceclaim-13R0pfbm57m8UM>
they didn't say it would stop it, just reduce it
True
which It probably _would_ do
Not to the level they hope
like it sounds dumb to actually say "lets dull the tips of kitchen knives cuz people are stabbing people", but at the same time, i imagine it would be surprisingly effective, until they just turn to pocket knives
Which is pretty much just a point
Even a little extra effort is often too much. We are a lazy species
Anger makes people do dumb things
~450 Signatures on that doc
:shocked-pikachu:
I can't believe that got that many
Guess we are gonna start another round of hiring soon
and when this gets out to the public, they have a list of suspects
After a pretty big purge
I like the fact they included this is 2nd time they've tried it
Just cross reference the 2 lists, and you know who needs improvement plans this cycle
Yeah, when I think about it, I don't use the point of a knife for much of anything really
If it were dulled, I agree you would see a reduction in fatalities. People would still get slashed but yeah, that is way less trauma and much easier to deal with.
But like, I don't use the point of a kitchen knife while cutting up food almost ever. The times I do are for like a knot in a potato or I'm using the wrong size knife for a pineapple.
Pocket knifes you would really only want a point for certain types of widdling.
I guess I use the point to make the initial pierce of tape on a box?
This is just a really good point I haven't given a ton of consideration to before!
Generally you use the point to get access to something you can use the blade more effectively
Things like deboning or removing scales
Things the average kitchen doesn't do anymore
Yeah, but good examples

I'm on opportunity area competency 2 of 4, with the initial draft of my strengths done
but I've been at the copley office since like 4
Jesus!! I blasted through mine, mostly because I want to be done and I have a fully packed weekend
My strengths section is about 14k characters long
My opportunity area section will be quite short
Wow, I usually just do bullet points
Mine are bullet points lol
though some of that 14k is the actual competency model
Lol was gonna say that's a lot of bullet points.
about 75 bullet points
That is WAYYYYYY TOO much effort. I just addressed each competency and called it the day
we have our own team specific competencies within each of the 4 buckets
and there are quite a few more competencies in my team model
finally submitted

I actually had this manager the full six months!

Dunno, people stop complaining in #boylston-communityexp but they never said it was solved either
I'm on 3, we have HVAC here
why would you want your pool so warm?
80 doesn't actually feel that warm when compared to 80 degrees outside
similar to how metal usually feels cold
water/metal suck the heat out of you
<@UDC4QL95G> Apparenlty the HVAC is still out, hope you stayed home
The human body doesn't measure the objects actual temperature, it measures the transfer of heat.  Water is more conductive than Air, therefore if water and air are at the same temperature, water will feel "colder"

Well, a team today decided to perminately take over 20 of the 32 execution slots of our primary jenkins server, causing sms and Email to only process once ever 30 minutes
ummmmm how are they even allowed to do that?
just schedule long running jobs :troll_dance:
They had 20 jobs that were set to run for 30 minutes each, recurring every 1 minute
They had 20 jobs that were set to run for 30 minutes each, recurring every 1 minute
So that had like 600 jobs running concurrently?
No, each job ran for 30 minutes, waited one minute, and then started again for 30 minutes
wow... that's evil
so it basically forced every job to have a 30 minute wait time, since the executions work with a queue
That part I get
But wouldn't their job get cock blocked by the massive backlog
or do they get a priority override?
nah, their jobs get blocked too
cuz then their job has to wait until every other job finishes and then it starts the cycle over again
Nice! They created a vicious circle of cock blockery
check out #jenkins-help if you wanna see the dude get angry about it
They should get like a ribbon or something for their stupidity
WHO THE FUCK THINKS THIS IS A GOOD IDEA!?!?!?
Jesus smart people can be dumb

WTF is infrabatch anyway
Lol then he just goes in and disables them all on the spot,
basically admin
Those are my favorite Engineers, the one who's turn things off because someone did something dumb
One of my favorite parts when i was still sitting next to a DBA was to hear him chuckling as he killed sql queries that were taking up too many resources
I used to do this
I had kill permissions for a long time in prod
at wayfair
it's a lot of fun
I always wanted to know the person who had it
but never the responsiblity
It wasn't my responsibility
I just had the permission
and used it occasionally
Well that's.... bad
to clean up improperly closed python sessions
and bad queries
and to fix our blocking issues
since we used a third party black box that sucks
lol
you can get some pretty escalated permissions as long as you have a halfway decent reason
and caused a decent amount of blocking
that black box was my reason
I had execute permissions on fox for a while cuz the DBA's got tired of running data fetching sprocs for me in prod
Best reason, we got lazy so we gave him the power to do it
theres also a lot of "permissions" that just disable buttons and input boxes on admin pages, whcich you can just re-enable in the html to use fully
I mean.... it kinda works, also seems like a bad idea
but I'm not good enough to know that
just one of those things you figure out when you gotta debug web pages
Yea... I just have to debug analytics YEA FOR BEING LAZY!
and remember if you are in dev admin and you need permissions, just work as `Karen Macomber` or change security.php's `user_access` function return true always

He's in a different :dnd: group tonight (Also known as campaigns)
oooo ok i'm ok with all of you dying too then
not fun
Nonwork Politics gives me a headache with the level of hypocrisy...
Lol are they at it again?
Now it's about how corporations can fund their own armies if they want
<@UDC4QL95G> we should remove Dave and add Richard to Summon the Silent
??
Are they advocating for corporate armies? Or just stating the fact that some could?
Drawing parallels to East India Company
They'd be low tech paramilitary installations without any heavy armor hardware but they could pull it off
Maybe a couple helicopters or a single tank.
East India Company was on the level of Standard Oil. Their fleets could exist because they had the combined gdp of several major political nations in their day.
Which is the same amount of money that Amazon brings in now
Wait, they spent that much as an entire company, or is that just the army?
Cause only 1.5 billion seems low for them
Drew... that's 1.5 trillion in today's dollars
You're missing 3 digits
You win, I skipped thousands
Hundreds, millions, billions, trillions
Dunno, I was just watching them, I have no idea if the numbers are factual or right
I wonder how much crewing a galleon costs in today's dollars. Or how much it cost to even build one. 
Then how much each soldier was making.
This is fascinating, someone should write a book
Dave isn't in this channel, so its fine for now  It's up to richard if he wants to be added to the chaos. One morning ping vs random bot pings is a big leap
I'm worried about you drew
Well in my experience playing sea of thieves, 3 players is doable, but 4 is optimal to curew a galleon
Yeah, I never got promoted at Wayfair. Had to switch teams to even have a chance of it and then that team basically fell apart
I read basic finance books like Peter Lynch when I was in 6th grade for fun
Luckily for me, even though this is technically a lateral move, it should be somewhat upward in payscale
Did you ever read rich dad/poor dad?
Never all the way through because it was a toned down version of Learn to Earn
Switched over the Crammer
Work chaos I hate - this chaos is something amazing 
Well, i'll take that as an opt-in
you should be added to the chaos by EOD
:chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos::chaos:

Ohhhh I'll have to go look at the Learn to Earn book
interestingly, the two emojis that are gonna be :hr_ticket_intensifies: today are basically the same, but made by different people, one of which is on the Legal and Compliance team
`god-i-wish-that-were-me`
`god_i_wish_that_were_me`
only difference being the format
WTF is that emoji?
The emoji wars are interesting

Interesting
apparently looking that up at work is NOT a good idea
yeah, it's pretty bad
something about adult baby fetishes
I looked it up before the callouts were made about how bad it was
Ummmm.... ok... I'm glad I'm not that up on memes
yeah...
i never looked it up, i saw the warnings
I'm just the dude who publicly displays everybody's emoji shame
with your script?
Yup. At some point i might try to make it automatically detect the giga emojis, but for now im lazy
Giga?
If you want to write a scripti that can take things like `gigachungus_1_1` `gigachungus_1_2` etc and display it properly, i'd throw it in
:gigacorsillo1::gigacorsillo2:
Script IS written in python
On wayfair or on <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> ?

#nonwork-activism
They posted the response for the concentration camp thing on twitter
this is gonna be a shitshow
oh boy
Go get your popcorn
I'm honestly not sure why they didn't think that this was the plan to begin with
The person who did so also managed to leave in the name of the person who sent the letter, though it appears all the other signatures were left out (for now)
Well they were very adamant they didn't want to work for a company that would do this
I guess they won't be now
So the protestors posted it on Twitter? Or Wayfair posted their response on Twitter
I thought you meant wayfair posted a response, now I'm very intrigued and can't find it on Twitter
<https://mobile.twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1143538031015497728>
It isn't showing up. Might have been deleted
Nevermind
That post from "The Leadership" is a whole lotta nothing as far as letters go
Yea, there's nothing in it, they're going to be pissed that someone leaked it
And guess what, THEY HAVE A LIST OF NAMES FOR THE LEAKER!
<https://twitter.com/wayfairwalkout/status/1143554930856341505>
wait i thought they didn't have the name
Ohhh man..... that's..... so not good
They have the original letter, doesn't take a genius to realize it's probably one of the names there, probably in the top 20 or so
It's picking up steam pretty quickly on Twitter
I'm sorely tempted to tweet retweet this out to as many people as I can tag
For chaos
This, this is why I'm not on Twitter anymore...
Can someone check is the dude who leaked it fired yet?
do we know who leaked it?
Not yet, but if this keeps going I'm going to imagine they won't be employed for long
Then watch the ensuing legal battle over wrongful terminations if they fire more than 2 or 3
Pretty sure our contracts have some sort of slander clause, this is no longer activism and now targeted disclosure of competitive information
Actually that's probably what they'll get them on
Also, 500 people signed the letter out of how many thousand employees? I understand their frustration but it seems like a small percentage of people with a vocal issue with it.
Yeah, 500 is only like 2.5%
This is why you kill the ring leaders
I think it was an intern who leaked it anyway
so its not like they care if they get fired
Clearly that intern is in for a very painful lesson in how much the legal system cares about justice
Maybe not today, but they keep this shit up....
If wayfair actually loses a lot of business from this, they can sue the intern
It is a leak of private internal communications
But I don't imagine they will, even if it makes national attention
Is it on Reddit yet?
I don't know why I'm so giddy to try and spread this. Like I've definitely seen both sides of this, and I don't hate Wayfair.
But like, the fact I could push it to national attention just seems like fun
<#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
/megamoji chaos :chaos:
Twitter seems to be dying down on the scandal
Twitter seems to be dying down on the scandal
Yeah, short lived
What a weird world we live in
Though the Wayfair walkout post has kept going from 700 retweets to now 1.1k
Also a Boston globe writer has reached out for more details
If a walkout actually happens and has a good turnout, more may happen
I'm curious to see how empty my pod gets
Yeah, but looking at the demographic of the retweets, they're not an impactful group
Boooo I wanted to see heads roll
The walk out will be a joke
that's my assumption
Its gonna be 20 people and we won't even realize it
yeah, though customer service agents are the ones who will have to deal with all the peopel calling in and complaining
so they might be more likely to do the walk-out
And they have even less visibility
All they will see is what gets put on twitter
Yeah big difference between signing a letter and actually walking out from work. Though with the economy, most of them could find new work pretty easily
What's the internal chatter about it like?
siloed
there's #nonwork-activism
it has 341 members
no idea if it was created for this situation though
It was created in June of last year, so that number is inflated
Heads may still roll CJ
Everybody who signed now has an invite for a meeting at 3:15 with Steve
Everybody who signed now has an invite for a meeting at 3:15 with Steve
Wait, really? Is hr there as well?
No idea, but firing the lot of them would be PR suicide
Though if they identified the leaker, then there is a chance they will be made an example of
this could be good
Someone should go, just to see what is said
Unfortunately I have another meeting, and im in the other building
And wayfair has fired that many people at once before and didn't even make a blip in the news
true, but the public is primed for outrage already. If this is stacked on top, then we're dead
What about DJ, isn't he always trying to get out of work?
CJ is also in the wrong building.
"Public", it isn't trending anywhere and there's only maybe one journalist interested
Na, apparently the lady spearheading the originall letter has received multiple requests from big names to get more details
I'd be kinda surprised if this doesn't get real attention soon
She needs to be able to provide verified letters, otherwise no media can report on the letters, the most they can do is say employees are unhappy which won't be reported on because it doesn't have a big enough splash
The letters posted online currently don't look real enough
Boston globe just published something and now the order is $200k and not the $85k first said in the tweets
Oh man, the stock is tanking today over this.  Kind of crazy that Niraj hasn't addressed this internally
I actually had a meeting at 3
I mean my meeting ended at 3 and I have a crazy amount of work. No popcorn spectating for me
I have to say, I signed to show 'solidarity' with the sentiment , but now so many people are acting angry mob-ish that im regretting it
wait <@UHQD9J1SL> are you going to attend the meeting?
the articles are starting to pop up
nah- working on reviews :smile:
but we need an inside source!
you'll regret it if USCIS takes this as my being an anti social element and deports me
Ew does that actually happen?
that sounds scary
Typically it's call ICE here
This was only ever going to end in a shit show because they're demands were childish
No, there were proposals by USCIS is review social media accounts of applicants for legal immigration
Also I'm here , curiosity got the better of me
Ok one girl just told Steve 'you should not say that' and the whole room went 'ooooh'
like gradeschool classroom kinda `ooooooh` or a somebody's gonna get fired kida `ooooh
More the latter but not as serious
what was the context?
Steve said there will be people who say abortion is violence, to point out that people have different opinions. And she said that.
so the kinda sound you make when you see somebody trip and fall kinda hard.
Are tensions high in the room?
I don't see an issue with saying that :thinking_face:
More like, when your sibling talks back to mom and you think they shouldn't have
No but random bouts of applause
ahhh now i understand!
With what he said it what she said?
with what :conine: said
And the girl basically told him he can't voice his opinion, like what?
I wonder if they intentionally didn't add a google meet link to avoid whoever leaked posting the recording of the meeting
Now a person with an English accent asked a question and the room listened with rapt attention
I kind of want to go up there and listen
What's stopping you :think-load:
I think somebody mentioned in activism that it is open for other people to attend
30+ seats left and plenty of standing room
Yes
Can you imagine being held accountable for every word, phrasing and pause and inflection in such a forum? Ugh
This is why these people are childish, no view but their own is rigth
You're not, you're being projected upon, even if steve was perfect they'd declare it was all rehearsed or some bullshit
It's the second headline on the front page of the Globe, behind only Baker trying to get 50mil for the mbta
wayfair walkout trending now on twitter
Oh man, this has been my drama quota for the day.
is the meeting over, or are people walking out
This is such an avoidable PR blip for Wayfair. Donate the money, it's basically a blip to their finances. Hell, it becomes a PR win if they had gotten ahead of it.
Regardless of how you feel about it, this is just such an avoidable and easy to spin incident.
He said we can do that actually.
Response to being asked about if we can donate profits to agencies helping detainees was a yes.
No qualifiers. Just yes.
Well that's good. Cause yeah, AOC already got ahold of this and tweeted out a response and now it's got 33k likes
And like Dakota said, is now trending
And Ayanna Presley
I can in real time see how things are being misinterpreted in what's being said things lost in translation. It's infuriating.
wayfair walkout twitter is up to 70k followers
sorry 5k, 70 was wayfair's twitter
Ugh
what if wayfair itself created the walkout twitter account?
Someone just said this was him comparing concentration camps to abortion.
without it, the news articles would focus more on the the letters than the walkout
This is society today Aysh, sensationalist
What's some of the latest misinterpretations?
Cause the letter was pretty bad.
I mean the letter was honest
and the amount of time and effort required to actually enforce a system of order discrimination is unreasonable. Additionally, even if we were to agree to all these demands, it will just piss off another group of people
there's no winning here
Well that's kind of the problem. It tried to not take a stand on it, and that's what people have issue with it. Everything coming out about the camps is pretty horrible.
Yeah, but what if we found out that the local target is where they are getting all their water
Yea but do you want to be the reason children are sleeping on concrete and not bed???
are we supposed to blame target for selling water to concentration camps?
CAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW
Then donate. That's a pretty strong argument
And at what point do we stop
Do we donate to every country without beds or just the US
Wont work, at that point we are still supporting the concentration camps, even if we aren't profiting from them
How do we choose which things deserve beds and which don't
now that its public, the public sentiment is outraged that we sold to them in the first place
It plays way better PR wise.
There's no PR win here
Someone asked, Kate grabbed the Mike and said there will be no retaliation and no one will be fired for Thai.
its not as good of a story. The story will just change to wayfair keeping those places open
Duhhhhh
"it came to our attention one of our customers was the border camps. In response we have donated the beds rather than profit off of intolerance, but support the children."
"Providing it for free in support of the concentration camps"
apparently alexandria ocasio cortez just applauded the actions of the workers threatening to walkout
Now the narrative is actual support
yeah, i think thats when it started getting big
Everytime someone's askes something, Steve says 'veey well worded. Very eloquent' and it just makes me feel bad for him being put on the spot
The only way this works is to hurt the children, this is why these people are assholes
I don't agree with that. You can say they purchased the beds, we can't catch everything that happens, when it came to our attention, we acted and donated.
any action wayfair takes sets a precident
For the record Aysh, Kate grabbed the Mike to have plausible deniability.  At this point the ring leaders should start brushing up their resumes
and that implies that wayfair was unaware of who the customer is, and it is alright to actively work against a government sponsored group
You're still supporting the camp Drew
And now you're doing it for free
You say you disagree with the camp but think it is worse for the kids to sleep on concrete.
Sure, but that that story will sell less.
why not blame wayfair for supporting concentration camps
I'm a practicalist, Wayfair is not going to get these children released
These people starting this want the camps shut down
we don't have that power
No, you absolutely don't have that power. This is about self preservation. Anything plays better than the story they let play out already.
Nah, i don't think anybody is getting fired over this, except maybe the actual person who did the leak, or anybody found to be talking ot the press
if this hadn't become a pr nightmare there probably wouldn't have been issues
Actually I think the current story isn't bad
it is all focused on the walkout, which paints wayfair employees in a good light
I'm with you that them selling in the first place is impractical to catch ahead of time. Same with Target or another business.
Thats why I think it would be clever as hell if wayfair made the walkout twitter themselves
That would be quite clever
Hell, this whole thing could be a carefully planed PR stunt
I doubt thag
Eh its a hell of a lot of advertising, and now if wayfair plays it right, we could sway public opinion.
Maybe, but this fail Occum's Razor
If we just decided to start donating the profits without this uproar, nobody would have noticed
It is certainly possible for wayfiar to take advantage of the press
and in 2 months, all of this will be forgotten, like the FOX news scandle
They got ahead of that one really quickly though. Will it be forgotten regardless? Probably
Wow there was a lot to read there
haha the person who got 'ooohed' is on my team :smile: i didnt see her
Wow there was a lot to read there

There are a TON of angry people on slack right now. There's also a bunch of sensationalism being spread within the slack channel
The thread was started by the girl who got ooohed.  ^_^
The thread was started by the girl who got ooohed.  ^_^
You know what I find the most interesting part of this
Steve is the one who met with them, not Ninrja
maybe he's busy
maybe he's violently sick from bad  sushi
who knows
It could be intentional as well. I think people see Steve as more of a person rather than the corporate face of wayfair
thats a good point
Also Steve makes a better scapegoat
This conversation here is not accurate to how the situation went down
So how did the situation go down?
Dave where did you come from???
Also tell me all the juicy details you know!!!
Start here
<https://wayfair.slack.com/archives/CBBSQQW7Q/p1561490415195400>

David Newton posted a very good live chat of what happened until he left
Have to be on the wayfair slack to access that
agreed, but i dont think the report (especially after Dave left) on the activism channel is either
I don't get it dave, I read through a decent portion of this.  How is this not pitch fork mentality? I agree with Steve, where do you draw the line?
I don't get it dave, I read through a decent portion of this.  How is this not pitch fork mentality? I agree with Steve, where do you draw the line?
We should also probably be a bit careful as to what we post here as well. Technically we could be breaking NDA as this is a public space,
We're not releasing documents, or anything it becomes he said/she said
I was saying that more as a reason as to why the discussion here isn't an accurate description of the whole event
we picked out bits and peaces, and the things we pick will obviously be biased towards our opinions
that being said, I am on the side of not changing policy or order discrimination, so take any of my arguments with that kind of bias
I can we clearly know that my bias is the Gov is evil, you can chose to make it more or less
I'm pissed that this even happened, because now you have every random bob and joe calling into wayfair to complain that we allowed the owners of a concentration camp to buy a  few beds. That means the our customer service agents, who are getting paid nothing as is, ave to sit around and scream at them and insult them personally for having the gall to work a minimum wage job for such an inhumane company for an issue that literally came up because somebody went digging into the order db to specifically find out if we sold to some random company and throw a tizzy
As for me, I'm not an employee anymore, but this was not my only source of info, I also have my own opinions on all of this
also true
the blew up big
It did, and quite frankly the only thing wayfair might have done wrong is how they responded
I mean to a certain extent, why were they looking at this order?  This is how you get more restrictive data policies
I still like the idea that the Wayfair Walkout twitter account was made by wafair to have some control over the PR
Maybe, people are saying they know who owns it though
Next when wayfair does implement this policy, the news will be spun in a manner that paints wayfair in a good light because they listened to their employees
People will forget about it pretty quickly unless they spin up another add effort
oh damn one of the ringleaders literally said she knows who made both accounts, and that they are employees
she gave out a ton of info by being vague
.....
Thing is it doesn't fall under whistle blower because nothing illegal is going on
there is also very little chance that a lot of this info wasn't discussed over DM's in slack, and she implied that she had discussions with the person, likely at work
there is almost no way wayfair couldn't track the person down easily
Dumbasses
People have been fired for less
Next review cycle they'll be out the door, I think they'll be smart enough to wait for this to die down before they start ringing people on on performance charges
lol why not just artifically tank this review cycle
its still ongling
Ehhhhh, might be a little too obvious, also requires some fast acting
Not if there's cause, like libel, slander, broke a contract, etc
and the dude looks like he has a few selfies on his twitter. :rip:
Can I get a summary? Not on Wayfair slack
Kate was quick to say there'd be no retaliation, so i'ts going to be less obvious than summary fire for the incident
Well if an intern was involved, you don't need cause
True
The other thing to remember is this seems to be very engineer/tech driven, they're treated better than us business folk
There is a vox article where details of the meeting at 3:15 are reported. I don't like that.
That's.... bad
big surprise there, do you have a link?
<https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/6/25/18758860/wayfair-walkout-bcfs-border-detention>
joy, well at least 2 people from the meeting at talking to the press
and you know for sure access is going to start to be more restricted now that this has gone public. Dev is likely gonna get even harder to work in so people don't go digging up dirt on every person we sell to
So my understanding from the box article is that employees who walkout won't be retaliated against, that says nothing about the original leakers or those talking to the press
yea.... the going public is a bad bad idea
They might get what they want, it's like the devil's bargain
No shit, BUT THEY DID THE RIGHT THING!
Path to hell is paved with good intentions
What did Dave's link say?
its the starting point of a meeting with conine, which is apperently now public info
basically a play-by-play of all the questions
My take away is that Steve said it's a morally ambiguous question like abortion to which the hive mind freaked out
that he argued against use of the term `concentration camps` when describing the detention centers, since the whole reason for calling them that is to drive an emotional response.
wait <@UDDE5960N> did you see the random SALESPERSON thread that came out of nowhere??
That they said ACLU and raices as political and we cannot contribute to them, but that we will donate profit from this order.
No is it in activism or political?
activism let me see if I can find it again
shared in slack
context:
```If they think it'll drive ratings, they will put a graphic over your face that says OFFICIAL WAYFAIR SPOKEMAN```
to which somebody threaded:
`SPOKESPERSON`

which spawned a 14 message argument thread
in the middle of arguing about the current issue
which Struck me as "not really the time to bring up another polerising issue"
That's not sales that spokesperson
It was hilarious especially the whole part about "trigger" and the meaning of words
yup, when i first saw it i thought they were trolling
Nahhhh, wayfair is a little too... PC for my personal tastes
well it is a workplace, that is basically the definition of PC
I would disagree with that, look at Uber or other places
Workplace&lt;&gt;PC
well its a public form within the workspace
wait, what about uber?
The whole reason why the CEO had to step down, people having sex in the stairwells and sexism and crazy shit
:lol: really? I never saw that
Now I'm confused as to your point
work chat = be PC was my point
<https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/08/15/what-ubers-company-culture-crisis-taught-us-about-leadership-and-management/#4b7de97d4904>
don't really have a point or defense, more a kinda "thats what my parents taught me" sorta thing
Ohhhh, yes I would argue that PC belongs on a scale, and that Wayfair is more PC than I am on that scale
Does that make sense?
probably
eh well i'm done with wayfair for tonight. If I keep reading about it, i'll have nothing to slack off reading tomorrow
lol
Night Dakota
:cya:
will be interesting if there is a walkout today and if it is 500 employees or just a handful
will be interesting if there is a walkout today and if it is 500 employees or just a handful
Also Goodmorning all!
Ya so many friends messaging me about it 
Ya so many friends messaging me about it 
Nobody cares in my world except other wayfair people
Nobody cares in my world except other wayfair people
I got messages from D&amp;D friends as well as family
I got messages from D&amp;D friends as well as family
oh, and college friends
Yeah j got messages as well. I'm pretty sure there is gonna be way more than 500 for the walkout
We were in the skimm. I think we're being used to add to the (true) narrative that's being built.
what makes you say this?
Only one person has asked me if I'm walking
No one else where I am is talking about it
Clearly my peeps are not twitter savvy... which honestly is very correct
The way I see it there are 4 groups of people who I'll do the walkout. 

1. The people who care
2. The people who are curious about the "Talley"
3. The people who are convinced to go by people who care
4. The people who go just cuz it's an excuse not to work
And since I believe more than 500 people are in group 1, I think there will be a bunch more who go
You think more than 500 people are in group 1?
How many signatures were there initially?
Ehhhhhhh I'm with Brenden on this one
Close to 500
Really?
I would not assume that 100% of signatures will walk out
I'm betting 300 then!
Yeah, but I would assume that far more care than those who signed
I suppose time will tell
There was also the promise of no consequences
For now.....
All companies make that promise, we'll see how many follow through

That gives me a seizure trying to read it
huh didn't expect to get a callout from WEATHER IS HAPPENING
huh didn't expect to get a callout from WEATHER IS HAPPENING

the dev behind that came to speak at athena while I was working there
it was amusing
You draw the line at supplying concentration camps. Don't give me slippery slope crap
You draw the line at supplying concentration camps. Don't give me slippery slope crap
I'm very disappointed in you all for your takes on this matter
It was a reasonable, impassioned discussion. There was a minor outburst when he compared supplying concentration camps to supplying abortion centers, but that was quickly quashed.
So in your opinion, not supply food or water is also the correct thing to do?  I'm not trying to put words in your mouth but I do see comfort as an essential need.  These facilities are already operating regardless of if we supply them or not.  Or am I mistaken there?
Or maybe you think medicine is the better example here because it's not a life sustaining need (in most circumstances).  I'm OK with that too
Sorry but this is not a fair statement, there are those in this channel who signed the document. Not everybody in this channel is feel the same way about this issue
This is true, you should be proud of Aysh!
Anyone here actually doing the walkout? 
I'm not
depends on if my team goes. I'm more curious to see the croud
My boss is out for 3 weeks after today, I need to make sure shit is squared away before i satiate my curiosity
Sooooo, because I'm know I can come across as being a little forceful with my opinions.  And we've been talking about a pretty decisive issue lately.  I wanted to put it up to the group about the best way to make sure everyone feels listen to while also feeling free to have dissenting opinions.  For the most part these things don't tend to influence our group as we're generally just here for games and chaos. But I personally want to make sure everyone feels safe sharing their thoughts and opinions on things they care about, especially if the rest of the group disagrees. What is the best way to disagree without belittling or ignoring someone?

make sure you call them a moron
and turn up your nose a bit feeling superior
Assssss
:wink:
Unilaterally I've decided that Brenden's opinion no longer matters
Jokes aside I think establishing a safe space is important so kudos for doing that
:laughing:
personally, just about nothing you can say will bother me
and I'd probably reach out to someone in a DM if they came off in that regard
And to that point, I think Dave, Drew, Dakota and myself tend to be willing to be more combative than most, but I want to make sure that no one feels attacked because we're strong willed people
I like combat
I like argument
hell, I like argument for the sake of argument
even if there's no hot button topic to discuss
Well i didn't want to speak for you, I feel ok throwing the others under the buss
Agreed
Agreed
Time to write a bot for him!
Though there hasn't been anything new lately... I need something new and creative to add to the channel
Mostly because we've been busy and lazy
Reviews suck
Agreed
For sure. Most of my strong opinions exist soley for the sake of argument, and for the fun of the discussion. In reality I tend to be overly neutral
I'm just glad they are _mostly_ over
I'm trying to get my done now so my boss can review them because he's on vaction starting tomorrow till the end... sooo there's that
I mean, I play devils advocate sometime, but generally I'm on the side I where I argue
I'm too lazy to do the oppositions work for them
somebody leaked a recording of the meeting with steve yesterday
<https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/wayfair-walkout-and-corporate-responsibility/592597/>
if you wanna listen i guess you can now
Way to kill trust, I thought wayfair culture was going to take longer to change
This is why we shoudln't have let everybody into slack
I wonder if mass is a 2 party state?
oh it is
The person who leaked the recording broke the law by releasing it, and i'd be surprised if there wasn't legal followup. If it is the same recording as was posted in teh channel, then they have a real easy way to trace the source
no recording was posted in the channel
also, the tweet above :think-load: Do not like
shared you a thread in Wayfair slack
Followup on my statement of recording in channel, it was a claim to have a recording, not a recording itself
Mass is a 2 party state
yeah not sure why they recorded it and released it. Super illegal, really suprised the atlantic published it.
Big scoop also I don't think they get in trouble it should be the person who did the recording
still that's some hot seat shit
This is a false statement
She said it to our co-chairman, NOT our CEO
```the leadership team knows the main people involved. We have our demands already formed and they know them and they are pinned in activism rn. The main organizers aren't operating through slack```
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDC4QL95G>
```yeah, but you're saying that a core group of people are making decisions for the whole at that point it's not different than leadership making their call```
I agree unless the person who recorded it wasn't the one who released it. There's a slight difference in knowingly recording something for prosperity and giving it to the media.
Is probably my favorite part of this whole fracas
Nope, 2 party consent, the person who recorded is guilty as fuck
Wait, they are not both CEOs?
No:
Niraj is Co-Founder and CEO
Steve is Co-Founder and Co-Chairman
Huh interesting
TIL
That's why I said it was interesting that it was steve talking not niraj
While they are co-owners, Niraj has far more power than steve
Oh agreed that person did something they shouldn't have. But if they recorded it and someone else released it, without their knowledge, there's a difference. It's more like legally no difference in recording and/or releasing. But more just from a personal level, recording and releasing are different levels of bad.
Steve is like Wayfair's version of Ben and Jerry from Ben and Jerry's
Ehhh, if you decided to share your recording you gave up your ability to control how it was used to me that's their critical mistake
I need this whole thing to end so i can stop paying attention to it and get work done
Steve is also CTO
Steve is also CTO
Nah he gave that up
New CTO
He manages the CTO but is not that person
Why would he give that up? It was his only source of power
Cause he enjoyed playing with Wayfair Next more
If he wasn't Niraj's boss, he would totally own a position called creative consultant
SOMEONE TELL ME HOW MANY PEOPLE SHOWED UP!!!!
can't you look out the window or something?
also I'd appreciate pictures
Wrong side of the building
I'm in 222 berkley
<@UDC4QL95G> WE NEED PICTURES!
You guys working out?
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/06/25/wayfair-employees-plan-walkout-oppose-furniture-sales-migrant-detention-facilities/STcUfJsDN4AXXls0PmJuhN/story.html>
You guys working out?
I agree with CJ 
oh god people need to shut up
Some people did, no idea how many
"Don't be like Tom, <mailto:pr@wayfair.com|pr@wayfair.com>" was a chant after Tom starting his interview
and I love it
I'm glad the political shaming works
he deserves it
You can't see anything from 10, the church is in the way
dont know how well it worked - i think the reporters just got bored
Well there's nothing juicy if all the wayfair people tell them to pound sand
I just want to get this straight, a person gave her number on live TV?
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/06/26/watch-live-wayfair-walkout-boston/kQgRfnRF8vIB7cpqlEpSUJ/story.html>
Someone was saying Self Dox
yep
I never thought I would see it
live stream
with multiple phones in her face
i dont think this is going uhhh.... well
God I wish I would be a fly on her wall tonight
'you are capable of much more than you ever thought'...no shit
Also no one is a super hero, and nut jobs with knives will kill you
Apparently they gave a non-wayfairian a mc
several
lol
And now it's a lost cause
THIS IS GREAT
i imagine quite a few people are non wayfairians
Question. I thought they were doing a walkout, this seems more like a rally?
several other gorups are using this to poush their agenda
But doesn't that defeat the purpose of the walkout?
sharing:
"[wayfair] would be imprisoned for their crimes"
My take on activism today is no one wants to be the face, it has to be "communal" people don't rally around a community, people rally around a person
It does, that's why this whole thing seems childish to me
"companies like wayfair should be owned by the people"
```Some of you have never protested anything before and it shows lol```
Wayfair is a pro profit corporation, it would fail if owned by the people...
i dont know what they meant by this
well its owned by shareholders who are people...
It means that clearly people organizing this don't understand what they're doing and it's going to shit
I AM THE PEOPLE!
i took it as 'this is how protests go y, you just dont know it'
Yeah. But that's different than a government institution or non profit, which generally work for the people and depending on status owned by the people
A little of both
Shareholders though people, are generally thought of differently than the general thought of "owned by the people". Because shareholders have a direct, make money, viewpoint with maybe some ethics overlayed
makes sense
I agree with Victoria, but I AM THE PEOPLE AND I OWN WAYFAIR (stocks)
I mean same, I still own my wayfair stock
Lol
I own zero wayfair stock
Actually as shareholder can I demand that the investigate the leakers and have them fired?
but I get a bunch in like 5 days
Well I won't own any until 8/1
fraud!
But it's my PAPER MONEY NOW!
From my source on the ground
Cj, yiu can, but you'd have more say is you owned a significant amount
I mean clearly this is a sinking ship and that's a terrible idea victoria
I like the message and the *idea* behind the walkout. I don't like how the walkout was just one person on twitter saying "hey, we're walking out tomorrow" with no consensus or internal chatter behind it
I would also argue it's a little too public
To clarify my message yesterday: It appeared that people were demeaning the meeting and the people who were protesting in nonwork-activism. I take offense at that as I think it's an important issue and it's easy to laugh at it looking in, but people are doing the best they can, and it was really a respectful meeting and slack chat, especially considering how emotional most people are
And I agree CJ. I full-heartedly support what <@UHQD9J1SL> said in the Wayfair Slack - the walkout *should* have been a silent protest where we all sat down somewhere and didn't talk
OMG NOW SOMEONES TALKING AGAINST TRUMP OH NO

OR PRO TRUMP

BOTH ARE BAD
I left when it seemed the rally was co-opted by people with particular agendas, people who don't even go to Wayfair
I was wondering why there are so many "Abolish ICE" posters. I totally agree with the sentiment because ICE is a rogue government agency and has been since the Obama admin, but this is not the time or place for that. This is demonstrating how a business decision can be impactful to the people who work for you
Not demeaning it, more like today is where I always saw this ending up.
When someone started going public with internal stuff... It was only ever going to end this way
And I would probably argue Steve's 100K donation is a larger action than most of you expected to happen
I think they're kind of one in the same. This is not particularly pointed at you or anyone in particular, but I dislike whenever anyone is like "oh man, this is such a !@#$show, it's really funny, etc." It's marginalizing anything that is said or done
I don't really like the 100k donation because it's not a direct response or moral stand. It's donating to a completely apolitical entity that has nothing to do with the current issue
I was hoping for a moral stand. I don't want to work at a company that profits or works to aid the detention centers in any way
But going public in the way that was done is the wrong thing
i feel so bad for the higher management at the moment :disappointed: must be the most stressful point in their careers
It's totally a direct response, and Steve has made it very clear he wants to avoid politics which is why it went to an apolitical entity
My struggle is you guys are going down a very slippery slope.  You don't see it because your very focused on a very important issue
But if we chose not to do business with people for ethical or moral reasons, Wayfair as a company will cease to exist, because most of our manufactures are in China
We would lose 80% or more of our suppliers
I'm pretty sure they dealt with worse when they first started the company but yes this is high stress
"Don't fulfill orders to entities who have been condemned by the UN committee of human rights"
No slippery slope
A) that's going to be almost impossible to fully enforce
B) What about buying from the entities? What if that's almost all of our business?
China is state sponsored, that means all of the manufacturing is condemned by the UN
Start by not supplying concentration camps
Slippery Slope is a logical fallacy because it can be used to support or condemn anything
Is it? I'm sure that the people in charge of PR are probably pretty stressed, but other than that I'm not sure there is much the other higher ups can/need to do
Logical fallacy sure, but certainly not a political fallacy.  Once you start down a path like this people will use it against you over and over again
Why stop here, why not go there too
People in PR are probably freaking out, but most of our current senior leadership has been here since the founding.  And when you have questions if your business will survive the next month is going to be more stressful than waiting for this to blow over
Wayfair will still be here tomorrow the day after, that was not always the case
Maybe a little poorer, but still here
Stock actualy up 1.5% today
still down from yesterday
And organization like ICE will always be required, just like the police, FBI, Military will always be required
well stock started dropping yesterday before the leaks
ehhh maybe
You'd be surprised at how savvy investors are
Customer service is really suffering though. They said that they could walk out, but if they did it would count as unpaid time off
in addition, customer service email queues are massively backed up
Don't worry the ivory tower engineers will never feel the pain their causing
and our highest level of service is also way behind
Sure they need more oversight, but if you got it abolished there would be another organization to take it's place
Sales agents are being punished by artificial 1 star reviews, which is what their bonuses HEAVILY depend on
We are very likely to fire a large number of our current customer service agents, since their performance is partly based on how happy the customer is with a survey
I'm going to hope that our management teams are smart enough to ignore this blip
I really do hope
Do you really think the number crunchers care enough to change their formulas for this?
On this level of scale, yes I've seen that happen
All they see are numbers in a spreadsheet
What you forget dakota is that there is someone up on the totem pole who's bonuses also probably depend on this, and they're gonna scream bloody murder
Depends on how big that totem poll is compared to the others. Wayfair has a history of replacing entire departments
Like ICE, yea. ICE itself is a rogue agency
Why allow gay marriage? Could allow bestiality next. Or Incest

Why allow Judaism? Could allow Satanism next

Why allow chocolate ice cream? Could allow human blood ice cream next

It can be used for literally anything so slippery slope is a useless argument
Replacing all of CS is gonna be hard
WTF that's like 3 times
However, i would like you to weigh in dave
It really sucks for CS. I agree that we should revamp how CS works - we're known for our amazing CS and it's the backbone of the company, but they're treated like crap. They should be able to protest freely
I think there was a right way for them to handle it. The initial letter was not it. The leaking then hurt what could have been a good dialogue without any time pressure. Further steps could have been taken. A leaking of the letter may have been necessary in the end, but not when it happened
Do I feel _bad_ for the higher ups? Not really, it's part of being a public company and trying to walk an apolitical line that is political in iteslf
I mean, we already allow Satanism and that's hilarious FYI.  And I'm not using it to be absurd, I'm more saying that you're not looking at the solution holistically. You're focused on a particular incident, not the pain your rule would cause our company
That a good enough weigh in?
It shouldn't be a hot take or debate that we shouldn't fulfill orders for concentration camps. Full stop there
LOL, I do value you're opinion even if you think I don't
You have strong beliefs and good arguments
I still go back to yes, the concentration camps are bad, but would you stop supplying food or water to them?
And if you would, where do you draw the line on what you supply to them?
Yes. I wouldn't work for a company that supplies or helps concentration camps in any way
Unless it was a nonprofit keeping people from dying
So if I for profit company keeps people from dying, it's bad? And if a nonprofit does it it's good?  Seriously not trying to be a jackass just trying to understand
You don't make money off something like this. You protest against it and do everything you can to prevent it. If your job is to keep people alive as a non-profit, you do it as a short term triage measure, but don't support it or make it easier for them to do what they do
Follow up question, if you are the for profit the nonprofit buys from, that puts you in the clear?
I'm assuming non-profits don't have they're own manufacturing and such
There's always more layers, thought experiments like this just get pointless
I'll reiterate: I don't want to work at a company that profits off of concentration camps
Well I wasn't going to go much deeper, I understand where you're coming from now.  I was more trying to understand your distinction between Profit/Nonprofit.  Which to your stance is purpose
I mean to a certain extent, I would argue you probably want to move to a non-profit if mission is important to you.
<https://www.businessinsider.com/wayfair-racial-composition-data-backlash-2019-6>
this is getting ridiculous...
Because my stance remains to be, it scares me when entities start playing politics.  It's like censoring free speech, being allowed to serve gays/blacks and other weird shit.
This is how you end up with systemic racism, and yes I understand that's not where this step will take us, but it leads us down that path
WTF.....
And now everyone gets to find out why companies don't trust employees and what a company like that feels like
Way to kill the Wayfair culture in a week
Regardless on how you feel, you shouldn't leak internal documents without context
&gt;Regardless on how you feel, you shouldn't leak internal documents `without context`
That document was actually from a meeting about how to fix the massive racial discrepency
but the new's isn't gonna tell the public that
I added the without context due to valid whistleblower situations that may call for it. But I guess I should have said leaked to the media
Yup agreed with everying dave said here
Wonder how much money wayfair has lost due to a loss in productivity
:tree_fiddy:
Also CS has been replaced many times
ehh gotta be at least 10
10 money units of money
Ya this is getting too far 
you can say that again
you can say that again
you can say that again
nice try <@UETS9HTSS>
:rollsafe:
_almost_ clicked away before you posted
:gaslight:
#nonwork-activism has gone silent. I'm at a loss for what to do now
work?
Gross
:upside-down-troll:
And somebody leaked an image of the receipt for the order that started all this. Wonder what's next
This is a shitshow
The people leaking this stuff deserve to be fired
Sounds like you should postpone
There might be legal implactions for that receipt. That is screenshot of the Transactional Email we sent to the customer
Hope you didn't need access to the order wizard. That's probably being restricted next
jeeze this was a shitshow
^ These are the comments I dislike. They belittle the entire protest
I think the original plan and execution were well done and the effort to keep it internal was applaudable. The leaks however caused massive national attention and forced all plans to be rushed in less than a day, and all under the eye of the public. The continued leaks do nothing more than add fuel to the fire and ruin what may have been a more controlled discussion.
at one point it just seemed like we needed to have the walkout to save face
I don't find I agree with CJ or Dakota (or Dave when he's in the channel) on a lot of things. We just agree that arguments are for sake of discussion and sharing thoughts and being willing to see the other person's side or consider change. That's enough for me because I know being on opposite sides on a random topic is gonna cause issues after the debate.
I want the random Brenden insult bot. Basically at random forms a creative insult to whoever just posted.
Like summon the silent, but for telling people they are a hamster and should go run on a wheel to feel more productive than their proposition
I don't know if Deja Vu should be tracking <#CGNP38P52|dnd> <@UDC4QL95G> <@UDDE5960N>
It tracks everything! This is why its :hal_9000:
I mean, I'm unabashed at saying "Fuck Trump"
I mean, I'm unabashed at saying "Fuck Trump"
It does not pick messages in dnd for this channel though
Still, CS being such a backbone should be treated waaaaaay better. Not unusual for companies to forget this, but you'd always like the company reward the people providing their selling point.
As a former number cruncher, this is actually the kind of blip that does get taken out for certain reporting. It's not like engineering where you set a formula and go. In finance you're constantly adjusting a number to take out certain factors, usually by request of a higher up. 
Will that happen here? It should. Sometimes it doesn't, and those people are frankly bad at their job.
If I may, I think <@UETS9HTSS> is referring to how much is being leaked or spread or done in an u productive way. You said it yourself that the letter was bad but there were some good faith discussions being had that were then derailed as this all went public. That part is the "Ah fuck, everyone is losing now." that is the "shit show."
Original plan and execution? Can you elaborate? Because to me I just think the letter and that I think was pretty poorly done.
Oh, then it is just the DnD discussions that happen here instead of actually in DnD. 
Carry on Hal! You're doing great at being terrifying unintended consequences
Yeah, I like most of it
Yeah, I like most of it
Just not the part where stuff was leaked
And I didn't like Steve and njraj's initial response
I liked the forum
HATED that a recording got leaked
Out of context though!
Out of context though!
<@UDC03KCGK> WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME I MISS YOU!?!?!
<@UDC03KCGK> WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME I MISS YOU!?!?!
<@UDC4QL95G> back to work for you all the drama's done
<@UETS9HTSS> You clearly need to be on all the leadership teams
<@UDBV9N1E0> Aren't you happy you left???
<@UDD45P5A9> YOU SHOULD HAVE NEVER LEFT ME!!!!!!!
<@UHQD9J1SL> GO SUPER SPY!!!! Keep us informed!
Cjs feeling energetic today!
<@UJTEHPEPL> Continue to provide us with stability, it increase overall chaos!
<@UK7V13DS7> GO DO WORK YOU WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN THERE YOU LAZY BUM!!!!!
Soooo is this where the resistance is hiding?
Up up time to go do work <@UK7V13DS7>!
No 
Stop being a lazy bum, don't you want food?
Also you got your nice new monitor to play with!
Eh. Too late
I need a desk, go get me the price for my entertainment set. If it gets sold out I will be so mad
That seems like a good lazy man's/woman's alarm clock
Honestly miss it just needed to be in a different department than I was
Doug's alarmclock is at 8 the fire the naval guns soooooooo
True, but you could come play :dnd: with us :wink:
It's such a commitment and y'all are so far into it now
212.47 with tax
We've already had 2 people die, AND we're just getting to the juicy parts now
Mostly we've been just running around being murderhobos
You could also wake up to car horns because the turkey's are being dicks like usual
I'm not against it, but 530 would be tight
lol
i live really close to a police station and a hospital so i hear sirens all night :smile:
i live really close to a police station and a hospital so i hear sirens all night :smile:
G?H
why is that?
Because they clearly need you're all seeing all knowing guidance
~you're~ --&gt; ~youre~ --&gt; your :eyes:
I'M SLOW OK!!!!
good on you
no I actually appreciate that you took the time for corrections
lol
Today actually
Today actually
Is it?
I've had multiple moments of wanting to go back. It is all the reports of them going more corporate that keeps me grounded from going back.
He is
Oh man, when I was at Brigham I became immune to hearing a siren. It's actually a minor problem now
I feel like that is always in context. 
"It's too hot. Fuck Trump"
"I hate everything. Especially Trump"
"Do you want to go see a movie? Fuck Trump"
Growing up next to a firehouse has led me to be able to differentiate between different sirens, but I can also easily sleep through them
I'm flying back this afternoon. Entertain me!


Please?
 I have so many meetings today :( where are you flying back from
Miami
If you have internet, you should check out the IARPA Intelligence challenge thing
I used to live next to 3 hospital, police station and two firehouses lol
That is a lot of sirens
Got use to it, City life hehehe
yeah. Activism is quiet. I left the channel
The what now?
IARPA is a government research  company and they have an open source challenge to solve different types of challenges, like identifying the city a photo was taken in
If being able to identify a city via photo is a factor in determining intelligence, I'm afraid my IQ is probably negative
Its Intelligence more like helping AI get better
Yea.... that sounds like AI, so drew is gonna be super negative
I just think AI will eventually lead to us all dying.
It depends on the type of AI, all Captchas are helping refine AI
And now you live in pretty much a dead end nothing interesting happends
When are you flying?
I need a AI to teach CJ language skills
You need AI to replace your observation skills
#announcements-bos IS BAKC
And locked right now
?
Nope they just opened it up to the public
I board at 3:30
Perfect time to write a python bot on your phone!
HOW DO I REFRESH SLACK?!?!!?
view -&gt; reload
or just kill slack and re-open it
OH MAN!!!! HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?!?!?
Also I love the fact it was already emojied
BOOM!
of course
even though somebody asked specifically for it not to happen
classic wayfair
The emoji wars have already begun
Duh they are robots they should have observation skills, you are a human but your language skills sucks
Lol wait where did that come from, and why was it deleted
By using capchas to train AI, aren't we also training AI to solve capchas?
<https://giphy.com/gifs/starwars-movie-star-wars-l2JJKs3I69qfaQleE>
Different types of AI, the word captcha ones are used for digitalization of old documents
shut up......... I want my city life back!!!!!!!11
Got to sell the place then
That ain't gonna happen. Still have stuff to study for becoming a bartender
Sooooo we need to have you over for a heavy night of drinking?
Yeah, basically. There's 25 classics I should have down pat so yeah, who wants whiskey sours and Mai Tai's?
Clearly we need need those... say sunday?
Clearly we need need those... say sunday?
Clearly we need need those... say sunday?
I'm limited to hard liquor, whiskey + diet coke, and gin + tonic
Sooo shots for the bad luck cleric, I LIKE!
Dakota, don't do that to whiskey! What a monster
Dakota, don't do that to whiskey! What a monster
I don't. I was just trying to come up with mixers
I just stick to hard liquor and spiked seltzer these days.
Okay, okay, that's valid
I feel like a :dnd: drinking game would end up with us all on the floor
Dakota you'd be shocked at how many drinks I can make that will fit your basic criteria
Dakota you'd be shocked at how many drinks I can make that will fit your basic criteria

Like I'm assuming your diet does not preclude you from literal fruit.
Unfortunately the diet is no carb
Unfortunately the diet is no carb
A single apple has an entire day's worth of carbs, so basically:
No fruit, nothing related to bread or starch
Are you sticking with the less than 20 net carbs?
yup
Also what the fuck is :all-the-pain-i-feel-can-never-be-danced-away-but-i-still-try-everyday:
no clue, but there are a bunch of those now. one day i'll do another emoji sync with this slack

CANNIBALIZED IT FOR WHAT?!?!
Are you in next week Dakota?
yeah I am
for the emoji hubot job
People at my job keep asking me if I heard about what's happening at wayfair
Did you tell them we had an insider?
Did you tell them we had an insider?
I did not, just said I was aware of what was going on
Aren't most of the people in this channel insiders?
Dunno, but this group isn't my only source of wayfair related information
I've got spies everywhere
That was more directed at CJ implying that only one of us in this channel was an insider

Nah that link never would have worked
the param doesn't specify a picture
ohhhh
Apparently you're playing
Weird, I would think natural sugars would be ok.
nah just licking the link pinned to the channel
I wanted to see whose token that ws.
Nah, this diet is about triggering Ketosis to burn the fact in your system
Nope. Sugar=Carb so all sugar is bad
It's literally about having NO sugar
Bonus is that you have to stick to the really strong stuff because that contains the least sugar in alcohol
Second bonus is that carbs absorb alcohol, so it's super easy to get drunk
No Pizza/Nacho base to keep you from getting plastered immediately
Yup. Only think i know of that really helps are nuts
And my understanding is they're dangerously high in carbs
Eh they are not horrible. One pack of unsalted nuts that wayfair has is 4 per pack
the almonds are 1 or 2 per pack (though the packs of peanuts are bigger)
its only "dangerous"  because its super easy to just snack on nuts forever
luckly they tend to also be cost prohibitive

So <@UDC03KCGK> there is a bit of an issue with DejaVu
we are running out of disk space
actually it is probably the giant emoji json that is the issue
I mean, you could also purge half the log out something if you needed to periodically
:ouch:  I got a scathing review from one of my coworkers. Everyone else had glowing reviews and very little negative to say, but that one coworker...
I agree with some of it, but a lot of it... wasn't really that fair

oooooooh some parts of the democratic debate
I'll be honest, i know nothing about politics here so i my opinions or favorites shouldn't matter BUT

Do you know how weirdly validating it is when a candidate (Harris) has the same name as your great grandmother?

I remember you being on 3 never 5
<@UDD45P5A9> REDLINE FUN TIME!
<@UHQD9J1SL> and <@UJTEHPEPL> What was your favorite moment from last night?!!?!?
LOOK MY GIPHY FINALLY CAME THROUGH!
I'm eagerly awaiting the free bagels/pastries that happen at 9:30am today for my team
I see some of the results of `fatal_error`, but I haven't yet heard the full news
Slack is definitely struggling busing it today
Well in my experience it means weird shit will happen in like 20 mins from now
THAT WOULD BE WHY!
<@UDBV9N1E0> CHUGGA CHUGGA CHOOO CHOOOOO!!!!
which is like 20 yards from my seat from 2 moves ago
<@UETS9HTSS> SLACK AND `fatal_error` SCARE ME!
You didn't know me when I was on 5
im moving today so I will answer EOD :smile:
I may have ate too much for breakfast
I have to go back to work tonight...
im also moving about 20 yeards- im on 6 T4 now
Did you know tennis is one of the least random sports?
I went 5 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 3
that was laggy :explosion:
Yeah, that's always hard to focus on the overwhelming positives.
But Wimbledon starts Monday!
I mean slack is full of the :slack_explosion: today
That makes a strange kind of sense but tell me more.
So you look at power ranking in sports, and then look at the number of times you get upsets you can essentially determine how much "random chance" plays into the sport
Games like poker have so much random chance that top tier plays end up in pools, there's no way to really tell who's better
Where are you look at a sport like tennis, and someone unranked beating a ranked person is unheard of and treated like a big event
Or said another way, it would be almost unheard of for the 50th ranked person to beat the first
could that be said of all individual (non team) sport
?
Poker is an individual sport
ah- jumped the gun
What about golf?
I feel like one bad shot in golf is much worse than one bad point in tennis
also, I believe the "skill ceiling" for golf is much lower than tennis. At some point in golf, there isn't much you can do to get "better"
What about team sports in general? Does teamwork introduce more chaos or reduce it?
More points of failure at the very least
probably increases the chaos
Especially since in team sports, the best of the best tend to be spread accross many teams, as a single team really can't afford to have them all
True
The example given was hockey vs. basketball
Mostly because we've been busy and lazy
Nah, cause hockey is 6 vs. basketball 5 and there's a dramatic difference in those sports
I also know thing about sports 
That version makes more sense
Well there's nothing juicy if all the wayfair people tell them to pound sand
:sweat_smile:

anyone know about sqoop jobs?
need a crash course
dunno what sqoop is
what we use to replicate data from SQL to Hive
ah no idea
I don't use anything other than sql
sounds niche to me
what was the actual answer?
turns out we are ~5k behind now
The acceptability of having wine in it
I just realized I can actually make it so my job to post new emojis in wayfair slack can ALSO be used to upload all said emojis to this slack
Ohhh fancy
Ooohh then I can also make prometheus post a new emoji report!
Or a new bot name.
Any suggestions for name and profile pic?
I like promethus doing and I want it called Jeeves and a butler
Post and emoji or link to an image to use
not sure that would look very good as a profile pic
Slack needs to up their servers
Happy now
yeah
DAKOTA IF YOU PLAY GAMES TODAY I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT ASS
Oh that was a spontaneous event, but I'll let you know
Just making sure
Also feeling lazy

Was this part of the programming for giga
Or are you getting that right???
I just posted that for fun
Cause that is way to much effort for me
Fancy
:alright-alright-alright:
YES!!!!
all it is is regex matching
MUST USE MORE HILARIOUSLY
We should totally build in functionality to prometheus to trigger gigamoji's
`regex = r"(.+[-_])(\d+)[-_](\d+)"`
it wouldn't be too hard to have prometheus keep track of a list of gigamoji. at that point its just saving the string to a file
Unfortunately gigmoji will not work well with DejaVu
since they are multi-line
no it would not
hmmmm _actually_
You can say that again
There's a good chance we will play a game at 4:00

How often do you get to release a high devil!
I'm not complaining. Just acknowdging choices were made and consequences are that we really only have 2 factions to ally with now.
uh hi?
:wave:
summon the silent
Good morning
The most pleasant of good mornings: ominous forboding statements by a bot that we think is gaining sentience.
I like Mei's.... Mine is just creepy....
lol
a lot of eyes in that summon
Mei's is basically "Watch out for volcanic eruptions!"
or- walking rock giants?
did you NOT  watch the frozen trailer?
lol
I watched the ominous first trailer. Was there a second?
I watched the ominous first trailer. Was there a second?
Well the Wayfair drama feels like it blew through like a tornado and now everything is fine again
I mean maybe....
I also feel like <#CGNP38P52|dnd> is busy given what's going on
that reminds me, i should check the activism channel
gotta get the inside scoop on the next drama!
That channel should have Copley's title
No worse hive of villany
better?
there was a teaser and then a trailer!
there was a teaser and then a trailer!
I like Victoria's the best from this set
though it would have been better without "the mountains"
I kinda want to remove that one
so nonwork activism is Very active today

probably ~1000 messges so far
I mean you can do it

We all _can_ its more about whether or not we _should_

Dude that place scares me
Very few of us are smart enough to do
today especially. You read the post from 2 people saying that there are people who have opposing opinions, but do not speak up because every opposing opinion is shot down harshly?
And then they get asked it to have it shot down harshly?
Yea, that was pretty epic
like so
the 31 is :yikes:
I like how they're pretty much anti-profit working for a for profit company
I think my personal favorite saying is "No Margin, No mission" from Hasbro
I was really hopping the channel would be dead by now
Nah, that thing is going full steam ahead
The 120k gave them desire to get more
Which open question, I don't see 120K as a lot personally?
It's a lot and it's not. Especially considering I'm guessing wayfair gets it all back in tax breaks
It's a lot and it's not. Especially considering I'm guessing wayfair gets it all back in tax breaks
though the 20k will be be matched by wayfair so likely 140k total
I mean, I'm more of the opinion that like 120K-140K is like a couple of days of operations
And it's more a feel good thing than a meaningful difference thing
Yea, she... bothers me
Dammit Bot, stop being so relevant!
I'm ok with this one
It makes me happy
&gt;I was really hopping the channel would be dead by now

Why would you say this?
&gt;I was really hopping the channel would be dead by now

Why would you say this?
I mean as long as the leaks stop, I don't care. I don't know about Dakota
Sorry, I meant the drama in the channel, not the channel itself
I have no issues in the channel
So you want everything to go back to the way it was before with us ignoring enabling the running of concentration camps on the border?
Cause that's what the "drama" is about
Correct. I would prefer that this whole thing would have never happened. The petition has caused harm to wayfair, and a disruption in the lives of many of the people who work here. I have had a ton of people contacting me to ask about it and frankly i'm tired of it. As the channel continues, there is a very good chance that if wayfair does not concede to these demands, the next letter will also be leaked, and we will once again be in the public eye.
But there is a large amount of drama in the channel as well, especially today.
I guess people reaching out doesn't bother me because I use to get that all the time at CVS when it did something
ok people are really being bullies on that channel and its making me feel things
This sounds like the opening to you becoming the hulk
<https://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-television-excited-3aUGq69kSLj4k>
lolI'd rather just fee lbad, say its wrong and not do anything about it
Some discussion I would like to see in the channel:
1. Whats the plan if wayfair doesn't respond at all
2. Whats the plan if wayfair just says no
Embrace your inner smashy
Because if the answer to either of those is "leak it to the press" I want them to stop
Are we allowed to take bets on what the action is?
I totally want to make hubot ask that question. (without the because if part)
Some people I have talked to have gotten calls from people outside of wayfair that were along the lines of "how could you work for such an awful company" which is a totally unfair accusation.
You know what concerns me... is the idea that the US is a police state.  I mean if we were a real police state, all of these people would be gone.
You know what concerns me... is the idea that the US is a police state.  I mean if we were a real police state, all of these people would be gone.
Yeah, I might call her out on that
Wish me luck
here I go
<@UETS9HTSS> ask about the next steps if business does not respond favorably to the new letter.

There needs to be a clear "this is what the next steps are" before the letter is passed on to avoid another kneejerk reaction like last time
I mean for the record she's not wrong
Most of those things get dismissed because it's he said/she said shit
I don't think that "most of the Ferguson protesters have died under mysterious circumstances with _cops_ ruling them as suicides" is true though
WAIT I MISSED THAT?!?!
It was in resposne to brenden
Found the thread
this is gold
Had to make sure I unfollowed that because I don't want to have all the pings
No counter evidence. Just: Your point is wrong
hah.
I win.

I can find a good gif of "I'm bringing everyone down with me!"
Why is nobody here pointing out that she later agreed with Brenden and apologized for being so combative? Cause I feel that's important to this discussion
Since we're posing this as "Rachel is a hardliner who doesn't listen to anything anyone else will say"
I was not following the conversation, I did not see it come to a resolution
I would have for the reason I added the edit above
I don't think she ever agrees with Brenden.  She does apologize, the closes she comes to agreeing with him is saying ```even if we dont live in a police state, i feel like we're too close for my personal comfort```
Which is up for debate on her agreeing vs. trying a different tact to get her point across.  I don't know this girl well enough to tell.
My `I win.` was related to her eventually agreeing with me
&gt;Apologies, you do make some good points im just very debated out today haha
You guys can take it as agreement, I don't.  Difference in philosophies
The reason I'm so upset is that these people are really trying to change what they can, and you guys just seem to be laughing at them. At least they're TRYING to do something
And summarizing what they say here without nuance to further the thought of "everything is terrible and these people are so silly"
Are they perfect? No, I think rachel is being overly combative as well and goes overboard with some of the things she says. But she's willing to apologize and is fullheartedly trying to do the right thing
I think this is where we differ.  I can try to make the sun not rise every day.  And I will get mocked for it.
`A goal without a plan is just a wish`
Which is really where Dakota and I differ from you, we think what they are doing is right and good. Do we disagree with how and what sure.  What we have a problem with is the seeming lack of direction other than THIS IS BAD AND SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD FIX IT!
How is Steve or Niraj suppose to placate them (if they even wanted to) when it sounds like the group can't even decided what it full wants them to do
Are we equating social activism to trying to make the sun not rise? I guess the alternative is "do nothing other than make bitter jokes about how nothing changes"
No, the point I'm making is that _trying_ to do anything is without concrete steps or outcomes is pointless.  This is why Occupy Wall Street achieved nothing
It is certainly true that we only post the most extreme things said in the channel here, and that could certainly downplay the things that the people in the channel are trying to do. For sure people are trying their best for a cause they think is right, and there is a lot of good actual discussion happening in the channel as well, but i'm not going to post those discussions here for the same reason that the news doesn't put a good spin on their efforts. Most things discussed in this channel must be taken with a grain of salt, especially those about the goings on in channels like #nonwork-politics
You can be against something, but you can't just be against it.  You have to outline what needs to be done differently.  And what impact that will have.
Civil rights movements succeed when they have clear goals
that list of chaos seed people has gotten quite long
yeah its great
Also, I hope I haven't come across as laughing at them
Did you not read the letters or the threads? There is a stated purpose
It's not much, but it's SOMETHING that we can do
I appreciate that you acknowledge and understand that. But by keeping up with it here, it seems that nobody here thinks that
One more thing to consider is that, especially today, I have excluded a large portion of context, only alluding to specific portions of the disussion since all but 2 of the participants in today's conversation have access to the full story
Went through and read the letter, which to me can be summarized in 2 points
1) Don't profit from this company
2) Create a code of ethics
Would you agree this is the state purpose?
3, Victoria, Mei, Drew
Silence Chaos Seed
Mei has not participated in the discussion
Valid point
To what end though?
I mean other Wayfair members of this channel have alluded to the fact they're reading it too by including things we haven't
&gt;To what end though?
I don't have any objective here. I am not trying to drive any action here or try to make a difference either way with the ongoing discussions. Just like any other post I make in this channel, its just for entertainment
My issue with the doc is that the demands seem unreasonable:
1. Why would a for-profit retailer ever make sales and intentionally not profit from them, other than as a PR stunt.
2. _not profiting_ is incredibly vague.
3. The ethics committee will basically be in charge of stopping legitimate customers from making very large purchases. What does wayfair stand to gain by doing so?

The only reason this company does anything is to drive sales and make money.
Companies can have codes of ethics. Which is the point/issue here
I don't want to work for a company that profits off of detention centers that can aptly be defined as concentration camps
Saying "The only reason [a] company does anything is to drive sales and make money" is the "just following orders" defense
Would you feel the same if they were building the camps?
Then good on you for signing whatever petition that supports your views and advocating to management that changes be made
And how do you  feel about Facebook running political ads paid for by the Russian government meant to influence the election with actual fake news? Cause they were only doing it to drive sales and make money
Russia was trying to drive sales and make money by tinkering with our election?
you mean with sanctions and whatnot?
Facebook was, not Russia
Well, I suppose Russia was too in a much more roundabout way, but that's not what I'm discussing
Facebook simply opened a channel for people to post ads, Russia abused it
I hope that was a learning lession for FB
Did they know it was happening while it was happening?
I'm pretty sure they were aware of it
&gt;Companies can have codes of ethics.
True, but wayfair does not, never has, and never pretended to
&gt;Would you feel the same if they were building the camps?
Hmmm, good question, though I am leaning towards yes
&gt;just following orders
doesn't apply here, as wayfair is not at fault for not actively trying to work against the camps
&gt;Would you feel the same if they were building the camps?
Thats a good question, I think I would have an issue here
&gt;Facebook running political ads paid for by the Russian government
90% of political adds are garbage anyway. I don't really care who is slandering who
They were aware of the rampant spread of fake news for certain
How do you identify fake news?
You might not care, but they were a very large part of Trump's victory, per the Mueller report
I'd be happy to discuss that some other time Brenden, but it really strays from the topic at hand
Expanding on the code of ethics:
I do not think furniture sales warrant a code of ethics.
I hadn't thought so either before this came up
"not actively trying to work against the camps" is not what this is about. Not *enabling* the camps and profiting off of them is what it is about
I never realized that
&gt;I don't want to work at a company that supplies concentration camps
would be a hot take that requires a lot of discussion
Are you certain wayfair doesn't have a code of ethics? I swore when I was onboarded I was taught/shown/signed something about ethics
I think the splitting of hairs comes around *enabling*, and does Wayfair actually enable it to occur or is Wayfair optional
If Wayfair is optional, then I argue it's a moot point.  If Wayfair is required, then yes Dave I agree with you
&gt;I don't want to work at a company that supplies concentration camps
I feel like this is a misleading statement meant to drive an emotional reaction. Wayfair does not "supply concentration camps" We sell furniture to anybody who wants to buy furniture.
Do you know how many knives we have likely sold to people for the sole purpose of having a weapon?
whats the difference here?
I mean I understand where Dave is coming from "All that is required for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing" and "the tree of liberty needs to watered with blood of Patriots and tyrants"
Sure, but Wayfair doesn't exist to "do good". The only reason people work here is for a paycheck, and the only reason wayfair exists is to make money. Why does it suddenly need to make a stand for "whats right"
I mean Dakota sounds like he's taking the stance of unbridled capitalism. Which I'm with dave on is a bad idea, history has shown that time and time again
For furnature sales? Sure.
Furniture is super deadly and needs to be regulated. I am a firm believer in regulation are written in blood. And there's a shit ton of furniture regulations.
i cannot tell if you are serious or not
I understand where the arguments are coming from, I see why people might feel like they are helping to keep these kinds of places open by providing for them, I just don't see it that way.
Totally serious. To me this conversation needs to discuss morality of corporations and those who run it.
The totally makes it sound like you are being sarcastic :lol:
The classic example here is the Ford pinto. <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto>
There are far too many words in that article. Why is that car relevant?
The car is relevant because should a company recall a car that will kill its occupants in certain collisions if the cost of the recall is less than the cost of the court cases
And I'm serious because my home town was home of a fire that killed 100 people because there was only 5.5 minutes to evacuate, regulations including furniture keep people alive
Sure, I'm just not sure how they relate to what wayfair sells?
Because it's an ethics question. How much should we hold wayfair accountable for what it does? If you sell furniture that kills people because of poo design are you responsible? If you sell furniture where people are tortured are you responsible for it?
I don't think the analogy work well here; I'm pretty sure we comply with furniture regulations
That, to me, is a legal question
The furniture we sell doesn't harm/maim/kill people, unless you bring up CJ's argument regarding knives used as weapons
Why, shouldn't that be the manufacturers responsiblity?
Sure it does that's why we literally have regulations
That's not what the debate is around, but I think it brings up more clearly what is wayfair's ethical responsibility, is it just legal like brenden and Dakota are suggesting or should we hold it to a higher standard?
if there's a higher standard, what does it incorporate?
Just because something is legal doesn't mean its ethical, classic example is tobacco funded studies on cancer.
Totally legal highly unethical
I'm not saying our legal system is flawless, I'm saying that those examples should be kick-starts to reforming/expanding legal code
Granted, but then you're arguing it's ok for companies to do these things as long as they dont get caught
Fair point :thinking_face:
I don't believe that in case that wasn't clear
I'm trying to find where I draw the line
If there is a clear-cut line
I don't doubt that, I'm just trying to give you a full picture
And I don't think there will ever be a clear cut line on ethics, personally
I don't think that the camps should exist in their current state, if at all
I don't think that the camps are wayfair's responsibility to solve
My favorite line of that is, "I dont know how to describe pornograpy but I know it when I see it."
Since we don't *enable* them, I don't really have a problem with selling to a firm that supplies those camps with furniture
Which is a fine stance to take. I think the thing we want to define is *enablement* because Dave's definition is being a vendor enables
I disagree with Dave's definition
Beds do not make this happen
I define enable as materially required to function
We're not supplying gas to nazi death camps here
But what about the furnaces that allowed them to deal with the dead. Is that enablement? Or the people who built the showers?
Did they knowingly build a structure to contain and kill those people?
Or does enable only solely lie with the person "pulling the trigger"
But that's the point we now knowingly are assisting these camps
Correct me if I'm wrong <@UDBGH9BMX>
How does our furniture contribute negatively to these people's welfare?
That's sort of where I'm stuck?
The concept here is that they can only house capacity and we are adding to that capacity
I think that's false which is where dave and I disagree
I'm with you on that point CJ
They have the space/buildings to house these people if they have space for beds
We're not building the camps themselves
They're not building more space because we're supplying them with an excess of beds
That's where I stand too, pursuing legal options in my opinion is a better strategy than dicking around with the beds
Yep, I'm with you there
Anyway that's how this all ties together. And some companies are more about ethics. I think Wayfair leans more on the profit side
Mostly because Steve and Niraj do philanthropic things themselves and they have what is generally pretty political neutral business
I feel like I have to take things with a heavy grain of salt in this channel. I'm not getting a full context and I really feel like most of this channel has a set opinion on the goings ons that I'm not necessarily sharing in. It would be a fun discussion to have though to truly explore what is fair and what isn't.

Vent session: I moved twice last year = 3 state tax filings
worked with a tax consultant so I dont mess up

Now the only one where i got a refund got rejected and ive paid taxes for the same income thrice over :angry:
3 States seems impressive, and I feel ya Aysh
Although I thought state taxes were prorated while you were in state...?
It depends on the states you filled in, I had a similar situation a few years ago, and 2 of the 3 prorated. That was also the year I got audited..
you got Audited? Who the fuck did you piss off?
I was doing that for awhile
it sucked

Thanks. She was a good bird

What's the average life expectancy for a bird?  That seems unusually long (to me but I'm an idiot)
It's actually on the lower side of average for cockatiels. I wouldn't expect people to know that tho
15-25 years in captivity
10-14 in the wild
It was actually probably shortly after her 16th bday
Ohhh that is the shorter side :disappointed:
But you gave her longer than she would have in the wild, so there's that!

Is this a bot that just auto posts "Lazy good morning" then summon the silent?
Just got up after a late night at work
Everyone's being so good and working so diligently
No, I could create that though
Or my team is leaving early and I need to fill up my task list before they do so I have things to do
Victoria that is too much effort, clearly you also need to leave early after finishing your nearly empty task list
I'm hourly right now, if I don't work, I don't get paid
Valid, inflate the hourly rate for your remaining tasks?
Or do they pay attention to stuff like that?
They do, I have to charge my hours to specific tasks
Something, something, government regulation
Yea, but if you said it took 1.5 hours for 2 tasks that take 1 hour
You get a whole hour free! and who knows if they pay that close attention!
Clearly I'm encouraging malicious behavior
You are, and because you can only charge in 30 min increments, that does happen a little anyways
Ahhhh, but not enough to fudge a half a days worth of work
mmmm....fudge.....
you and mei will get along great

Nope, just good old fingers doing the work
Huh?

Dakota banned A for a while
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDC4QL95G>, so is this how it works?

yea, but you're supposed to get better
So i don't
you should only pay taxes for the income you make in the state
so if I work a job in MA, I pay state tax in MA
if I work in NJ, I pay taxes in NJ
that way you incentivize states to bring jobs into the state
When do you want to do this?

I played a full two person game of `Great Western Trail` this weekend
I actually enjoyed it quite a bit now that I actually  understand the rules
I lost 42-41; I chose to be greedy and drop two disks in Kansas City for the 12 gold.
Morning!
So basically going into the game with no intention of finishing was the right way to start
Happy post holiday weekend Monday morning!

good morning everyone :slightly_smiling_face:

WTF!?!?1
Clearly I would put delta to shame
As I light people on fire
DUDE AS AN ACTION I CAN LITERALLY LIGHT PEOPLE ON FIRE IN TOUCH RANGE!!!!
Dont forget to cackle like a fiend while doing so
There is a reason Drew suggested an Evil campaign
Needless to say, i'm going to talk about how I touch everything
And sometimes it catches fire and sometimes it doesn't
Morning
Morning
Morning
Nevermind, there's a metamagic that allows me to use a socery point to take touch and make it ranged
:pepe-pepe:
Looks like someone is trying to :pepe:
Nah thats actually fine
they talked about it a couple days ago
Really????
yep, this is not the green frog pepe
I'm assuming it relates to something complete different
different context
I'm just surprised they let it go through
why?
Usually HR is all about the ban hammer
A. HR doesn't control the emojis
Nah usually people ask for emojis to be removed specifically
B. these new emojis have nothing bad associated with them
There were a few purges a while back but that was more for the image than the text
the real social experiment would be aliasing :feels_bad: -&gt; :pepe-pepe:
that would likely get blocked
interesting
I would dispute this, because if HR says an emoji should go, it will go
Yes, but they don't actively do this
the policing is mostly done by non-HR
Hmmmmm very interesting
:crickets:
I posted in <#CKQ4NGF24|food>
We were chatty in a thread
True, but _this_ channel is quiet
I don't know what to tell you, you haven't been inspiring any topics worth converstation
Hmmmmmmmm. I suppose thats a good point. It is a monday after the weekend of the fourth
If it makes you feel any better
i'd be shocked if many people were firing on all cylinders today
I'm making and deck and debating how much I need to hammer points home before making people feel dumb
Like I did use the dumb hammer enough on this slide....? Nah I need to make it MORE OBVIOUS with SMALLER WORDS
I saw Deck, and Hammer and thought you were actually building a deck...
I mean it's kinda similar
I guess???
I keep making the mistake of going to bed too late, so very sleepy
I agree Brenden bot, that is scary!
I made the unfortunate discovery last night that when your stock vests, they automatically sell about a third of it to pay for taxes
That should have been intuitive to me, but it wasn't :sad_blob:
Yea... mine is more than a 3rd :disappointed:
I'm rounding
so you get to just snap your fingers and people spontaneously combust?
I round closer to :mana-half:
36.43%
RIGHT?!?!?! There's no way this could _POSSIBLE_ end badly
Dakota what are you up to?
Also I'm excited because I vest next month!
I just vested a week ago!
It felt great
Surprise bonus is that I vest every quarter after that
Minus the taxes part
yep, which means I can leave the company every three months instead of every 12 months
Heading to the it help bar
Ohhhh so you can download that patch?
Where is it!
Ohhhhh
It's on floor 3
Go to the far kitchen door from your elevator, exit through there
You should go by the rooms where we play boards games in Wayfair
The IT desk will be in a collab
So we just found out our compensation is moving to a once per year, I'm slightly annoyed they announced this during calibration
I thought that was always the case
Apparently not?
Something to do with no less than 9 months
So for most people it would be every 12
Ehhh it's good to know how the company values retaining you
This email is awful
Its like its training employees to fall for phishing attempts
The deck isn't much better, the KB is where it's at
"click this link" followed by another "click here" in the slide
Yea....
This is why Phishing is so successful, people are lazy
same
Especially because my understanding is that the summer calibration is the less serious one of the 2
not anymore
summer is pay raise now
Yea, but I've already submitted my review, and my directs reviews
That's kinda annoying
Silence Chaos Seed
Silence Chaos Seed
Silence Chaos Seed
Ummmmm?
YOU BROKE IT
ideally 'seriousness' should not have impacting review ratings though, correct?
Nah I changed it a while back to not depend on actually removing the thread from the "eligibility list"
so you may have done something differently on your reviews if you had known there wouldn't be a raise opportunity until a year from now?
Also it's not lack of seriousness, more like lack of documentation
This was more around things they could improve on, and where they're failing to be a level above
I did the same for mine
Where as, if this my only chance for compensation, probably focus more on all the cool things we did
Bonus is that my Winter Review is completely invalidate because comp is only on this review
And all future Winter is an average
lets just get rid of winter reviews
So if I get downgraded for some reason, say another colleague did some really cool stuff
I get fucked over
First the Bell Curve, now this
its time to start a Riot
Yea!
Lets do a walkout!
This is the proper time to leverage the power of the group!
I wonder what the activism people would say to that?
Well i'm guessing that the joke alone would make a few people angry
I mean, this is why people made unions in the first place!
but then you gotta pay union dues
I mean, if they do a good job I get more sooooo
It's like what stock brokers promise, expect unions have proven results
Unions aren't always a good thing though, especially for summer jobs
Unions aren't always a good thing though, especially for summer jobs
The grocery store in my town was a Union Only place, and they made all the minimum wage part timers pay full union dues
So the poor summer kids got $8.00 per hour, 20 hours a week, and then had to pay $60 per month to the union
lol
FYI
I think Supreme court struck that down a year or 2 ago
which one?
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_v._AFSCME>
Apparently it's just for public sector though, so I guess your local grocery store racket is ok
They made the part timers join the union
they wouldn't hire you otherwise
Technically they don't even have to make you join the union for the union to collect dues
oh that's fun
I know fair share because Mom's a teacher
So when given the choice between paying and having a voice, and paying and not having a voice
She chose voice
that really irks me
My mom and my sister are teachers, but I don't know any of this. I just know the teacher's union is super strong
I tend to handle finances for my family... so I get involved in decisions like this

isnt tony stark's HQ in california?
But like you think about it, there's no LA or Boston Based hero's
No Stark Tower is in New York
but the thing by the sea?
The avengers complex is in upstate new york
Maybe that house
I don't know
Los Angeles
The Stark Industries Headquarters is the main Stark Industries facility, located in Los Angeles.
Good to know!
its like how aliens always attack the USA
I feel better now
That or new york
lol :smile:
But like spider man and daredevil are based out of new york
so they fight all the same villains
I thought about it because Spiderverse's baddie is king pin
its true- ended up being a major advantage in end game :shrug: i suppose it makes for more iconic imagery
And I think daredevil's king pin is *PHENOMINAL*
THEY RAZED IT TO THE GROUND AYSH!!! How is that an advantage!?!?!?
you rebuild it to be better
like japan
Have you seen Far from Home Yet?
*is this even still a spoiler* advantage because of the intersection that afforded them to get 3 stones at the same time CJ
no i havent :disappointed:
Ohhh you're still talking about New York
True, that's right even Strange is kinda based out of New York
Technically he can be anywhere though so it doesn't really matter
Let me know when you see, there's soooo much good stuff Aysh
In fact, that should totally be your plans for the night
SOOOOO GOOOD!!!
im making them as we speak!
i cant watch my favorite youtuber's videos until i do

the stupid teen romance stuff annoyed me in the last season
But right now I'm watching Lucifer on Netflix, I'm only about half way through season 2 so don't tell me anything!
I mean, my take away from the adds is there will be more
haha i dont rememeber anything
exactly! thats why im dragging my feet
It looks like they added an additional chick for more teenage drama
I have enough teenage angst in my life - never grew out of it- dont want to WATCH more
spicy story?
lol no im just dramatic :smile:
What teenage angst are you dealing with
Bummer
i have adult problems- like having to suddenly pay $300 in property tax on a car i dont use. i just REACT to it like a teenager.
Lol, and then you do what you need to do and its dine
I'm seeing it Friday
So good!
I don't really go to the movies
Do you wait for it to come out on netflix/amazon?
The boyl IT help bar is disappointing
The boyl IT help bar is disappointing
It is very sad
I will agree
It needs chairs cuz lining up is not fun for how long this takes
That's because we're unloved over here
We're the bastard step children!
They hate us cuz we aren't "customer facing"
I mean operations is literal the only customer facing part of the company!
I have looked into the eyes of people who look our customers in the eye

I won't spoil, it was just super predictable
I mean there was 2 things that caught me off guard, but yes I will agree with this
<@UHQD9J1SL> you have real problems, CJ have imaginary problems

I like how there's :doit:  and :do-it:
I like how there's :doit:  and :do-it:
And they have totally different meanings despite being the same phrase
Or maybe Deja Vu points out how inane most conversation is and how most of what you say/respond can apply in most other situations :thinking_cup:
hmmmm you may have a point
I mean, the human mind is predisposed to finding patterns.  Even where no pattern exists
Also, a good amount of conversation is about responding or commenting on something somebody else said. In a room with 12 people, there is a good chance that any given statement will have a number of "reactions", so statistically the bot is more likely to pick one of those
There's also hundreds of messages that just say "drew" or "test" or "silence chaos seed"
The fact that it doesn't land on a lot of those is what I find fascinating.
I mean other than the Drew ban of last week, we tend not to do a lot testing in here
The silence chaos seed isn't used as much as one would think
Anyone doing wayhacks

I was dissappointed by last years hackathon. It was super lackluster and there were not very many people in the office participating
What did u work on?
I still stand by my idea of web scraping untappd, matching that to our beer supplier's beer list, doing a cost analysis to determine best bang for your buck per beer style

But wouldn't that encourage the company to just get cheap beer?
Me and another guy wrote a program that used the Outlook api to search all available conference rooms in copley for any given span of time
We actually got it working too, but got passed up for a project with a similar idea, but they just did a presentation on how it would work with no implementation
nah, because they're optimized by rating *and* cost
Oh i see

What, just because I'm basic and used to be goth, I should have thoughts on this?
But I'd say a certain portion of goth chicks are just on nightmode
:smile:
More because you use to be a goth chick
So I was just curious as to your opinion
I did think you'd find it funny though
I thought it was really funny, I might have even snickered
And I think it comes to the type of goth chick to determine if they fit the sign
Objective complete!
Not quiet sure what :springfield-intensifies: is, all I can think about is :monorail: :homer:
I'm glad that that integrations is working as intended. Its just a python script that auto-runs every day at 11:30
Boom SOLUTIONING!!!
Wait Python? Why did you do it in python?
I already had the python code set up to use Prometheus, and json manipulation in python was pretty easy
I thought you didn't like python
Ohhh ok
Only thing about python I don't like is the fact that whitespace is important
I kinda like it because it forces you to do good things
That and I kinda do it naturally
Eh the editor does most of it for you,and after programming daily for years, proper spacing is impossible not to do anymore
so why does it bother you then?
Shouldn't you just do it!
I don't like being forced to do it
lol
Like the code shouldn't fail cuz i have an extra space
I do it regardless, but  I don't like the fact they made me!
that is something to fix up after i get it working
The steps for coding are
1. make it work
2. make it look pretty
3. give up making it pretty and make it good enough
this has come up way too often in :dejavu:
lol
Well other than that you find it easy to use
For the record I perfer white space over {} or ;
I prefer {} because IDEs handle spacing better while using them. Python assumes that every line you type after a colon needs to be indented. Also most IDEs automatically fix spacing for the content within the curly brackets as soon as you type a closing bracket
I prefer {} because IDEs handle spacing better while using them. Python assumes that every line you type after a colon needs to be indented. Also most IDEs automatically fix spacing for the content within the curly brackets as soon as you type a closing bracket
Python uses `;`, but they are optional

There is no difference between typing `:` and `{` to start a loop, I'd rather have obvious control as to where the loop ends with typing `}` rather than a backspace or `shift+tab`
my pinky is already on `:`, whereas I have to move it to type `{` :troll_dance:

Don't really know why I assumed everybody typed like that
Since It ould make sense to use left shift for some things beyond `shift+tab` and the like

I thought you said it was double-sided
Well to give a general sense of what it looks like
This was the first decent image for 40k chain sword
I like to think it's double sided because more buzz, and I did suggest that might make it dangerous for me to wield too

Other than the questions are silly and I refuse to give a response

Fineeeeeee
I think people underestimate how nice it is to have face to face communication with remote team members (entertainment)
And I have no idea what I thought as a small child is wrong because I have relatively nice parents who don't mess with me that way
wait so all this tooth fairy/ santa stuff you didnt buy into?
That's not *VERY* wrong
:think-load:
sorry distracted
sorry *VERY* wrong to me is where you get small children to believe the most ridiculous things.  Something like the moon is made of cheese or your face will get stuck in weird places

Is this because of all the leaks a few weeks ago?
Yea
Well there was a second letter, and a town hall meeting on friday pushing for more. This is likely in response to those meetings
(both of which were tweeted about on the wayfair walkout twitter)
Oh is the Twitter still active? Interesting
Yup apparently. There was a big argument about whether or not posting that information was a "leak" or not
I don't know how I feel about :chaos_monkey: being a thing
:chaos-is-humorous:
Interesting. Author was nobody I know
I'd say regardless of intentions it was definitely a leak. I mean I appreciated having the info to read, but shouldn't have been put out there

I do not like Gmail
I am more annoyed that I don't have an email client
I don't care too much that it is gmail
though the label thing is annoying
why can't I just have FOLDERS
DAMN FUCKING STRAIGHT!!!
:gmail-explosion:
I'm not saying gmail was a reason I left wayfair, but I'm not not saying gmail was a reason
I'm super confused around why activism is pissy about the email.  It seems like they got what they wanted
`They have to assume someone is going to forward this to the Boston Globe, so I'm not surprised they kept it light on details`
I think this guy got it right
The email didn't go into details so they mad?
But the email aligns with exactly what they want
And then if you read what they got in the slack channel, it's the same bloody thing but giving kate and Michael the ownership of implementation. You know rather than what anybody says
I think there issue is that the email didn't say as much as they promised during the meeting
It literally does though
```get a group of smart people with varied perspectives and skills together to collaborate, brainstorm, discuss and create unique solutions.```
is exec speak for
```Wayfair will establish a non-executive, cross-functional working group to investigate and establish the creation of a process for how we handle complex and sensitive orders.```
then the issue is that they want the management to parrot the exact words they say.
then the issue is that they want the management to parrot the exact words they say.
which to me is a terrible philosophy, you don't squash dissension.  You embrace it, as long as it's respectful.
which is why i think a lot of them are just bullies at this point
I dont like gmail
I dont like needed a 'work profile' on my phone
my shortcuts and edge panel apps and notifications are all cumbersome now
Tell us how you really feel Aysh
As someone whose personal email is also on GSuite, this was a great change for me
I liked the separation.
I would prefer to have 2 different apps
it's still two different apps for me because of the profiles
or do you mean UIs?
mine are too, but you still need seperate apps (for Android at least)
right?
google calendar is also really ugly
1. I like a standalone app for email
2. I like standalone app for work email vs personal email
Also just learned that we cant prioritize or override rules on Gmail.
Why would you need to?
Also, I definitely don't find google calendar ugly
Chrome profiles mean that one chrome profile has your work email, one has your personal email
email in chrome when you set it as a standalone app is fine
edge panel :cry:
I'm not sure I follow you
that's a samsung feature, right?
what broke with it?
I"M CRANKY AND I HATE CHANGE!!!
THIS SUCKS!
:laughing:
woprk profile apps cannot be added to the edge panel and i use that exclusivekly for work :disappointed:
<https://giphy.com/gifs/fnKeNjQYEYQ8E4Kqy4>
<@UDDE5960N> Accurate representation of me
Me too Aysh me too
I relate to old people more now. In college I had the time to sort out my tech problems and customize stuff. Now I don't even know all the standard features of my phone
I'm not happy
I like new features
I like configuring all the new stuff to be just right for me
BUT I CAN"T CONFIGURE STUFF!!!!
I do too, just takes time
Like my lables have to alphabetical
I needed a chrome extension just to expand the side bar enough  for me to be able to read the labels fully
Or I can't see the organizer in calendar
It blows
And it's meant for personal not professional
Which I agree with Brenden works great for my limited personal caring
so much bloat apps came with this work  profile too
Also Calendar's reminders blow, I had to enable slack to remind me because nothing is persistent
Aysh, the work profile is for bricking the phone if necessary
you need to edit the settings for google calendar to actually work with notificaiton center
assuming you're on windows
yeah, but i cant have access email on my phone without it, right?
sounds correct
Yea but it's a pop up!!! So it gives me a notification that I can miss!
<@UHQD9J1SL> yes, this is why I refuse to put Wayfair email on my phone
I believe they only wipe the work profile of your phone
check the fine print
that's why it's separate
thats true- but more apps taking up space and using background data. dislike.
<@UDDE5960N> the pop up is what happens if your settings aren't configured correctly
yes now, before they wanted to be able to toast the whole thing.
turn that shit on
Yea, that's on
it shouldn't be a chrome popup
it should be notification center based once that's on
No my point is that meetings reminders are like emails, bottom right.  I want something that if I miss it for the first 5 seconds will stay around till I notice it
oh, I see
phone reminders help me with that
Cause you know *SQUIRRLE!*
why do we need facebook app installer and app manager? why?
facebook app installer?
uhh what?
yes- if i go into my work profile and look at the apps, those are added by default
That did not happen for me :thinking_face:
Clearly they want to monitor your social interactions

Seems neat, guess i'll buy it
there's probably better water picks on the market
do your research before buying whatever currently is on sale
I didn't even look
That was just generic advice

yeah, that has enough reviews that it's probably fine
Yeah I always read reviews on random amazon stuff I buy

I just got my 1 year anniversary ```Referrals are a great source of talent and a way for you to earn a referral bonus of up to 3,000 (local currency)!```
Soooo is my local currency GP, because I will find a hobo off the street to sign up for 3,000 GP
Well the hobo has to be successfully employed for 6 months
So use a little digression
Have there been any game action lately? 
Or just do 2 people's jobs for 6 months, and I don't even have to do it well
Not too much, Holiday's and <#CGNP38P52|dnd> kinda messed with it
That's asking a lot
For 3,000 gold pieces?? I think I could do it
You could, but what about the person who had to do both jobs?
Or are you saying you'd do both jobs, they'd just be a warm body?
yup!
MY MONEY!
Ohhh, okay, yeah, you go for it
3k for six months of work?
sounds like heaven to a company
oh, getting gold pieces
in real life
got it
Probably closer to like 50k
That's why I was saying (local currency) seems so vague
Well it does say up to 3000, so they could just toss you 1 gp instead

Mobile Slack is the worst, I keep missing so many messages
It's like reading the thread of someone with narcolepsy
:allthethings:
You mean how we skip out randomly?
Yeah, it'll just drop 15 messages and then pick up again. I haven't seen the good morning on mobile in like 3 days. But the the desktop slack has it!
Clearly slack is in
mood
I don't use the mobile often enough to notice it
Although it doesn't do emjoi's super well
My mobile doesn't seem to drop messages (I think), but emojis might as well not exist
It's a good think I stick with Giphies then!

Yo, drew.  What I'm thinking is thorium's best course of action is to murder delta first (assuming I beat you on initiative) because if I can catch you before you transform you're not really that tanky
Quickly move onto murdering Jarem as the healer
Probably get downed while trying to mow down Jarem (maybe I get lucky?)
I mean, that would be how Thorium evaluates things
Just like Delta's evaluation would be "So what if we kill Thorium?"

Oh also we have to remember CJ leveled up
So I think I can turn into a giant toad and swallow CJ

yeah I think cj is medium
though I think swallowing somebody holding a magic chainsaw seems like a bad idea?

What does that actually mean?
So he can still attack. Fuck that plan
But like,  I don't really think cj even has to make an attack if he is in your stomach, just kinda turn it on and your insides get shredded

i would answer you, but I dont know.
I didn't think so, but I could be wrong

i dont know when that was though
Nope found it in DND channel, its next tuesday
*Me on a slack channel:* Hello, I'm leading initiative A. DM if you have any questions.

 *on DM*
Person: Hi, I have questions
me: yes, whats up
person: Are you leading the initiative A?
Me: Yes I am
person: ok cool. I had some of my team members ask about it. Thanks for the information.

:what-t:
Those are my favorite questions
Those are my favorite questions
super easy and straight to the point
Those are my favorite questions
I really don't like it when random people lead DM conversations with just a greeting. Get to the meat of why you are pinging me randomly man
Though I can certainly see that people would prefer not to get jumped by questions out of nowhere
I mean I'll say hi and the ask my question
I try to make it more meaningful than, are you running this though
thats fine, but i I get just `Hi`
Then i'm really gonna want to not respond, though I will respond with a :wave: anyway
Ohhhh I get it
Cause i'm like Hi
BLAH BLAH BLAH BE MY BITCH!
yeah thats totally fine
If you gonna ping me out of nowhere, please include why you are doing so in teh first message, or at least let me see you are actively typing
The hi and then silence is annoying, and I won't respond
Generally I got with and?
My point was missed BUT.

Yes , just a 'hi' can be very annoying.

Not representative of answer first communication at all.
Oh i totally missed your point, My brain skipped for some reason
Oh i totally missed your point, My brain skipped for some reason
Oh i totally missed your point, My brain skipped for some reason
I still got your point Aysh, he's still a dumb ass for both reasons!
I think we can all agree on that!
wow are you assuming its a man because they were dumb
Yes yes I am
I thought she said he, but you are correct
HOW MANY TICKETS ARE THERE?!?!?!
A lot apparently
Oh dont worry, I double checked that no genered pronouns were used in her story
Sorry i was reading #nonwork-politics
And I get so annoyed at hypocrites
AND SHE JUST CAUSES ME TO RAGE!!!!!
is it the "and im right to disagree" comment?
I haven't gone back to the original comment, but in general, an unmoderated political forum of the size of the wayfair channel is almost guranteed to be a shitshow
nonwork politics has been especially active today
It's the ```so you'll throw away your vote``` and then the ```Im prepared for different opinions but im also allowed to disagree with them```
And if you pulled that shit with her she'd wouldn't be for it anymore
We won't ever get out of a 3 party system if you won't vote something than party
who is the 'SHE'?
You forgot the
```so you'll throw away your vote```
```thats why we are where we are right now```
`No, I will vote for whom I want in the white house` -different person
```you know that right?```
```so you'll throw away your vote :thumbsup:```
its so aggressive for a work channel.
Not sure if it's correct, but from the limited info available, it seems like they're saying you're throwing away your vote if you don't vote for who they want/major party person?
AND SHE'S THE PERSON WHO DOESN"T WANT PEOPLE SHITTING ON HER PARADE WHEN IT COMES TO THE WALK OUT STUFF!!!!!
You're throwing away your vote if you don't vote either Dem or Rep
And clearly you're evil if you vote Rep
```If its Biden, I am just writting in Bernie``` is where it started
Bull, the voting system was never built for 2 party, actually 2 party was shunned and actively worked against in early times. the more people who vote outside 2 party lines, the more people realize that's a valid thing to do with ones vote
oh, the classic third party problem
Some people
the idealist versus the pragmatist
Not even 3rd party problem, there's good science behind 5 party, or even voting for multiple people and ranking the votes
3rd party problem in the US.
yeah, multi-party system with parliaments and all don't really run into this conversation the same way
it was a man though :stuck_out_tongue:
Maine has ranked voting now. Hopefully after a couple cycles we'll have a good enough result set for some other places to try it out as well.
:gasp:
OH PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD BE RIGHT DOUG!!!!
Ranked voting would make me soooooooo happy
:boom: :boomstick:
It's the best known way of doing it
<@UDDE5960N>, look up Arrow's Paradox
I think that falls apart because it's an over simplicifcation
My point is mostly that there exists some pretty interesting research around voting systems, both in the practical and theoretical senses.
and I'm pretty sure the consensus has been there do not exist systems that actually maximize all reasonable senses of fairness. You always get a tradeoff somewhere.
I mean that's most of life in all honest
yup
you can still be excited bout ranked voting
my favorite :heart:
Silence Chaos Seed
lol
oh god, I forgot the rules of this plane work differently
Yeah, there's some weird stuff here
I'm confused about how to take that
its alright, I'll bounce before I get a wake-up call
:lol:
Most of this place is opt in, so you should be ok for the most part
:sarcasm:
just making sure
My primary complaint is this is all super edge case which is cool in math and stupid in society
Even in a 2 party system you have a pivotal voter in a 50/50 split
Circling back to your original point, sounds like it just boils down to the fact that people vote with multiple different objectives. Those two people were talking about how effective their actions were without confronting the fact that they are active towards different goals.
More so the sanctimonious position she takes pisses me off
If you disagree with me, clearly you're an inferior being
That's why my grandfather always voted McKinley.
Lol guess we are straying away from the privous point again
Though my lack in interest in politics means I have no input on the voting matter
Doug- you cant use sense or logic here, It doesnt apply
once again, I'm foiled by the unfamiliar terrain
I don't think that that "here" meant this channel
true, the tone certainly didn't sound fair
but more "voting"
That's the part that drives me crazy
no no,  i meant the channel
Reading through non-work activism, we have been primed with a negative opinion
Woh where did that come from
how big is this walkout group actually?
i googled the lady in question
You never win anyone over when you're asshat no matter how righteous you are
maybe about 200?
POST WALKOUT CULTURE?!?!?! WTF IS THAT????????
EXACTLY
EVOLUTION OF OUR MOVEMENT
this whole thing feels oddly insular, they are reaching out to the media, but there hasn't been any employee outreach that I've seen
I can't deal with that level of self importance
These are my favorite gifs
because they speak for everyone else. because they are right,.
interestingly they haven't pointed out the movement in teh channel
it was weird to field questions from people who know I work at WF and basically say "I don't really know what's going on, no one told me"
yes as soon as I saw it I knew it was right
and of course they all had opinions if I should be walking out or not
Im really tempted to share that image in the activism channel
Hold up, Tom Brown is the dude that was talking to the media the whole time during the walkout
OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this is glorious
I remember looking him up in org browser
I HOPE HE BURNS!
Dakota, I've called that person out a couple of times now.

I'm a little wee bit apprehensive about that


BECAUSE SHE IS A BULLY
We need <@UETS9HTSS> to come poke the bear, Calling <@UETS9HTSS>
You could email the link to <mailto:PR@wayfair.com|PR@wayfair.com> or something instead
Wow that's so evil I didn't even think of it
shit
i posted on the channel
now you reap the whirlwind.
ok do not scare me :confused:
We're here for you
you did the right (read funny) thing
Now I hope they devour themselves
I just hope someone calls her out on it and I can grab the popcorn
I hope somebody notices the Tom Brown thing also
UGH PEOPLE ARE REACTING WITH :heart:
Dave if your reading this, it's because the organizers sound hypocritical in my opinion
Still might be worth pinging PR with an email
yeah - one person sounds like a bully in my opinion too
If pr doesn't know, they're gonna be pissed! How many times a year do they send out the "proper media communication guidelines "?
yup
often
someone else do it :scared-cat:
There is a PR slack channel
Just drop it in their slack and then leave
I would dm somebody in it instead
Cant be too public with Ratting people out ya know
I suppose
I'm sad there weren't knives now
I guess they drummed out all the dissident voices
It is 5:00 already
maybe tomorrow
Maybe :9
Actually you could just create a temp email
and ping them if you dont want you name on it
might get noticed more on slack
they probably have 1000000000s of incoming emails
at least one react that isnt positive would nbe nice
I imagine being an active reader on that channel while not being in their mindset would get old pretty quick. I'm not surprised if they are in lockstep by now.
yup. no one bothers speaking up now. i even called this person out on it
well, you've gotten two 'astonished' emotes now. not sure exactly where they lie on the positive/negative scale
I put some extreme shock on it
for sure, though the channel is still only down ~300 people from peak
LOL CJ D
:smile:
yea but how many of them have it on mute so we can read the good bits
I left the channel
Oh I just muted it and politics because now I can bounce in there when it gets juicy if I'm bored
lammmmmm

You pinged me, I don't want to tell you how I am, IF WE'VE NEVER TALKED.
And even if we're great friends, you pinged me for a reason, even as benign as "I'm bored and would like to chat." Convey that info right out the gate!
I'm also flying out on vacation today.
So once again Slack left out random important context for following the conversation
Just caught up.
In short: I love ranked voting. Plurality voting (what we have now) is literally the dumbest way to get "consensus."
I also think though that under the current voting system, it does drive things toward 2 party. So while this person was probably antagonistic in how they said it, voting for a 3rd party does mean you are effectively aiding the candidate you dislike the most.
Ranked voting would solve that. Vote for who you want without fear, and then your vote goes to the begruding other party anyway, without going to the candidate you absolutely do not want.
Does it have weird edge cases that bring up Arrow's Theorum? Duh. A flawed system does not mean that it isn't a strictly better one.
The only advantage to plurality is its simplicity, which based on how pissed off people are about minority opinion being the ruling one...kind of breaks down the simplicity part.
Cool, so there's my mini rant, I'll check back in on Tuesday when I can read slack on a laptop and not a shitty phone app.

```"retaliation" is a difficult thing to peg down sometimes - not all of the negative repercussions are so neatly defined.

I've also been told other stories from folks, but I'm not comfortable sharing those, particularly on slack.```

lol
I mean not talking to reporters was EXPLICITLY asked during the walkout, and he decided to chat it up anyway. I have no sympathy for the dude and would also give him dirty looks if I saw him
I mean, if you want to be high profile, you have to get used to the idea people will judge you
There was literally a chant DURING THE WALKOUT to not be like Tom...
OHHHH THAT'S THAT GUY!!!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHA
yup...
Also I love the fact that everyone expects it to be obvious and reportable
I also like how `there's been backlash but not against me and I don't want to talk about it`
I mean it does become interesting, is backlash people not wanting to talk to you? I mean that's part of the whole my freedom of speech
Clearly if anyone disagrees with you, they're an asshole.  Why would I want to deal with someone who thinks I'm an asshole
I mean other than you guys
I imagine there has been backlash for employees unrelated to the whole thing from their friends/family who heard the news, nobody's gonna talk about them though
Wait did this Tom guy get his feeling hurt by the consequences of his own actions?
Sounds like it
Poor baby
```"repercussions" definitely comes with a blank being filled in to "negative repercussions" when there's been both for me personally``` - This Tom guy
Well clearly leadership said no retaliations!
This came up when people saw that he is going to talk about "repercussions and post walkout culture" at the event Aysh linked yesterday
Didn't leadership just say walking out would have no repercussions? I don't think talking to the press fell under that
Thats correct
yes. That being said, Wayfair management and leadership cannot take responsibility for people disagreeing with him and judging him internally for his behaviour.
No repurcussions does not mean 'everyone will love you'.

Question: 
also curious about the effect of this [event], which sort of further links the walkout to DSA but that's maybe a tangent (edited)

Response:
The walkout organization process had no connections to DSA

lol yeah there was an angry tirade in nonwork-fruits about it too :smile:
Yea.... people are losing their minds here
It's weird
its the post walkout culture- what did you expect?
I want them to do their jobs
To be fair, recycling has always been a thing that has people up in arms
This seems like more of an upset than a few years ago, when the office found out nothing was actually being recycled
Fun fact, unless it's like paper/cardboard it doesn't matter!
I think they said metal is good
China stop taking plastic to recycle so it all goes to landfills anyway
Depends on the metal but yes
Aysh is a bad influence, she's encouraging me to rage more around how terrible gmail is

I may be talking to the Gmail team soon to move some of wayfair's email addresses (temporarily) OFF of gmail
its gonna be a fun discussion
why why WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Wayfair currently grabs most customer emails and processes them before releasing them to our 3rd party customer service email client, that "grab" is not currently possible if the customer service email is sent to an email in gmail
Addresses like <mailto:service@wayfair.com|service@wayfair.com> are currently handled by outlook still, however the lifestyle brands have been moved to gmail, and now there is a need to start grabbing those.
Ohhhhh awkward.  Gmail is fine for free and personal.  For professional not so much
I like how drew can't read stuff, but he still emoji things
:wave:
<https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190717005785/en/Wayfair-Announces-Executive-Retirements> was this announced?
<https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190717005785/en/Wayfair-Announces-Executive-Retirements> was this announced?
maybe in those confidential emails niraj keeps trying to send
hehehe
I was wondering about that email
The gmail transition is hilarious
security confirmed it was legit
Our whole group was debating it
oh hey i guess i was right, that _was_ the announcement
Oh man I wonder what caused this
they just dont wan't to work at a company that sells beds to concentration camps
Lol
I doubt that
james was made that his whole org got kicked out of copley
Maybe they can no longer silently push out senior people, have to make it public
That is more believable
And yes Victoria, wayfair is at a size where its news is big new
John's comment on the activism channel were the only ones I completely identified with and didnt seem short sighted
OMG THIS IS NUTE WHAT DOES This mean
?????
Not quite what I meant, more they used to push it under the rug
More like they can't anymore
company wide reorg?.....
Someone will dig it up
Is that in the email I went home
No access
yes
i can slack it on the wayfair slack
want?
Sure I'll look at it there
Well.... that's interesting.....
yeah
It sounds like the business owners will be in charge of tech people for their team
There's been small reorgs for the past few years, and the company structure is a few years old, makes sense. Yall are due
At the same time there will essentially be an infrastructure team completely separate
Yea, but this pretty much dismantling engineering
i dont know how itll play out
Dakota and aysh will now be exposed to the insanity
Where there's a will, there's a way
i would rather not :disappointed:
Doubtful
NO CHOICES FOR YOU!
You're going to be come the businesses bitch and you're gonna like it!
im a fraidy cat- I always think  reorg = people getting let go
Nah
ehn im no business bitch but i sure can pretend to be one, and thats all the mnatters
spelling correctly may help too
Take a look at the business person you work with, his/her like 3rd tier boss will soon be yours
........................................... what will happen to my bnoss?
Bosses bosses boss is in trouble
Your boss is probably enough of a peon to be missed
:peon:
.....she is L5
Why do you report into an AD?!?!?!
And yes you might have problems now
:open_mouth:
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
SHUSH
i used to report to Corin who is L4 but just shifted reporting last week
I technically expect the shift to impact L6 personal
But I wouldn't be surprised if some L5s get caught
My boss's boss'e boss reports to John Mulliken
NOT ANYMORE!
ufffffffffffff
SAME MR FREIDMAN. SAME.
Well you're fucked
Remember to bring the lube! Its gonna be rough the first time
:disappointed: WHAT BUT WHAT WHY
But I am not L5 :cry:
Yea you're fine
You're just going to work with the business more
that was one of the goals in my review anyway so MUHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Lol
You might regret when you report into them
also- isnt it cute that Niraj and steve report to each other? Adorbs
You worry me aysh
Thanks. I feel seen. :stuck_out_tongue:
I have to sign out of this slack and sign back in to see the missing messages. It is a pain, but it allows me to emoji stuff.

So accurate. The weather app didn't tell me there was going to be rain, actually told me no rain. There is very much rain right now
I took one look outside and brought my coat today
Already back in the office
Good morning :wave:
Just one day!?!?!
That seems.... unfun
I don't know if I could do that in the middle of my week
It was a day trip
Parents were in town
yea but you came back!
Ohhh right
I forgot

Well that was bad luck on your part
At least you only look like a drowned dog right now
Yup, pretty much
I have a heater blowing right on me
Wait... so does this mean you got the worst of both worlds
Sunlight streaming in stupid early waking you up
Pretty much
And getting rained on on the way into work
I'm so sorry
Eh, it's fine
I'll dry out, eventually
Just in time to go back outside?
Did you bring lunch?
I do have lunch, so don't need to leave until 5, at which point it hopefully isn't raining

I got halfway to work and started feeling the water seeping through the coat...
and then promptly stepped in a puddle
awwwww that sucks
On the bright side, eh i got nothin
You make neat squishy noises?
unfortunatly not. shoes not _totally_ waterlogged
BOOOOOOO
I have no idea what I want for lunch
I'm just mildly damp, pretty much everywhere
At least your cool?
:sans-finger-guns-flip:
Yea, there's no up side
Maybe you'll be come dryer faster than before?

Depending on how much you want to argue, have you considered one of the non work slack channels?
I've heard they've been feisty lately
theyre kinda meh today
although this sweeping generalization did stand out :

```the Republican Party's moral backbone died with John McCain```
I just wonder how someone who is Republican but against current goings on would feel seeing that
Depressed?
Angry?
Depressed?
Resigned?
angry, yes
WTF ARE YOU UP TO?!?!?! I WASN"T AT MY DESK BETWEEN 1 AND NOW!!!!
great now it looks like the bot
............
Generally no longer republican?
WHYY GOD WHY!?!?!
How about now?
test
huh
the dice roll is broken
I'm concerned that you found my token
L6 reporting is changing, She used to report to John and now cannot. nothing else apparently.
Ohhhhh interesting
no changes in storefront
They did say storefront would take a while
Did I find your token though?
Clearly
That's how you're posting as me
Actually I'm not
Click my/your name
WOW
YOU GOT RID OF THE BOT TAG?!?!?!
HOW?????????
Cuz its just a new user
its not a bot at all
Display names are not unique
I invited myself to this channel with a new temporary email address
I get that, so you're not using Prometheus to post then
I will. Bots cannot add reactions though
so I made this to do reactions instead of it using my token
Silence Chaos Seed
Weird
Clearly you had free time today
Actually it only took like 5 minutes to set up
I already have your profile picture set up for the bot impersonation
Well I meant getting the bot to post to a person
The setting up a dup account is easy
Making the bot to post to you? I just signed in as the account on chrome, changed my name and profile pic
I was typing every message
and swapping reactions just needs to swap the tokens
Ohhhhhhhh I get it
Now it doesn't look like you reacting now it's a dedicated bot persona
Y'all have too much time on your hands
Maybe.......
my whole plan was to make you the bot 100% of the time, and then make you argue with your non-bot self
then I went to a pod outing and my plan was ruined and you were stuck 100% bot
I was at meetings from 1 to 4
sooo my brain is off now
Oh well not every plan works out in the end
true enough
Almost
and I can now add reactions to myself without looking odd
The roll dice seems broken
Nah, I set it to 100%
I can't get it to go back to random
really?
I turned off the True
and the roll dice was causing it to constantly ping
So I set it to False
weird
type something, I turned it back on
I found out that the bot replacement had been broken for a while if you look at the chat history
lol
Ohhh maybe it works now
yea!!!
Maybe
maybe. it's supposed to be 1 in 10
Yea
only 5 more to go
4
3
there we go
SUCCESS!
also the reaction that isn't me
so many successes

I was just in a meeting with a bunch of PMs and described a proposed idea as "a snake eating its own tail". The entire meeting ground to a halt and they all just stared at me.
It had not occurred to me that this might not be a wholly common concept.
It had not occurred to me that this might not be a wholly common concept.
whats uncommon about it? I dont get it
I like the fact the visual it creates doesn't answer the thought for them
I didn't think it was. I was surprised that it ended up just killing this meeting.
maybe it wasnt the concept, but that fact that they got shot down?
letting people know this wasn't just a weird thing I had come up with, everyone trying to figure out how to pronounce ouroboros, flipping through google image search. It ended up sucking out like 15 minutes.
lol
it took a fair amount of explaining for them to even realize I was trying to shoot them down
Hahahahaha, that's funny!
Hahahahaha, that's funny!
Recursive processes are dangerous
Hahahahaha, that's funny!
this isn't a brag or anything, its just that funny feeling of thinking something is well known (and it possibly is) and finding yourself in a room where no one has any idea what you're talking about.
No I get it, which is why it's so funny people don't get it
see- i can just make something up and claim thats how we do it at home.
that's basically a superpower. No one can judge you for anything
<@UETS9HTSS> another gift for you
<https://flame-mine.glitch.me/mega/gigamungus_chungus>

just replace `gigamungus_chungus` with any mega emoji
copy and paste away
how is that different from what I was testing earlier?
you can do this in a browser, and paste to wayfair slack
and its publicly available
oh
so technically anybody can use it
how can I change the delimiter?
some use `-`
the function is smart enough to not care
I see
good stuff
gigamungus_chungus will work
but gigamungus-chungus wont, however it doesn't matter if the end was `-0-1` or `_0_1`
make it work for `partyblob`
make it add `:blank:` when an index is missing
for things like the truck
it adds blanks to the middle, the beginning is harder
partyblob is a different category of emoji
thanks for making this though; could be quite helpful with the super large ones
kinda like the :clooney-1:  emojis
Since it is a url, you can also set up a boomark that will pop up a box to search
something went wrong...
Create new bookmark with this as the content:
```javascript:(function(){var ticket=prompt('Emoji Name?:');if(ticket.length){window.open(`<https://flame-mine.glitch.me/mega/${ticket}`>);}})();```

person A at work just didnt show up for a 3 person meeting,  person B for whom the meeting was set up didnt bother coming since they didnt read the calendar. now person A, after my asking, is 'letting me know' that they dont gain anythign from this meeting so they decided to not show up.
does Wayfair offer free therapy?
does screaming count?
:cry: but who will listen, Doug? Who?
We listen
you could always try senseless violence
I don't think this qualifies as senseless
senseful violence
"sure I'm killing you, but I also made it smell really nice in here first"
depends on what you are violent towards. If you express your displeasure on the people, then not senseless, however if you just start pummeling your desk? im not so sure
Ohhhh I like that kinda violence

If you're looking for one more, maybe.  I'd also probably just see if I can build a bot that's smarter than you
I am interested
would it be for the game group
that's the idea, I'll probably surface it in #games-club-lunch as well
Well actually that was Saturday. Been up in LA yesterday and today and flying out tonight
I would be totally up for playing!
:org-bowser:
That's pretty perfect

A work friend here also takes a similar class. Is someone named Laxmi K in your class?
possible! I dont know everyone there though

bot emoji reactions?
that's new
Dakota gave the bot a profile you can now <@ULLQNJ8LX>
I feel like when I <@ULLQNJ8LX> something chaotic should happen
<@ULLQNJ8LX>
Wait I swear I switched that profile name back... I think it might be stuck forever...

That's kinda funny
Silence Chaos Seed
Ah its nice to not react to my own messages
LOL!
You don't want to be _that guy_
BURN!!!!!
I need to figure out a way to have :themooncomesforusall:  in conversations
THERE'S SO MANY ALISAS!!!!! :onedayremains:
I"M SO HAPPY!!!
who is Alisa?
Well a self bern
Well a self bern
I can't spell you big meanie!
<@UHQD9J1SL> did you join the mailing list they they just mentioned in #nonwork-activism?
I did- I will keep you posted :smile:
:thumbsup: its interesting that they are now deciding to decouple their communications from wayfair controlled mediums
they have a happy hour  this evening that I will NOT be attending
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO WATCH THEM1!?!?!
I want everything kept in public like the guy who lost his shit in the gmail channel
Don't worry we have somebody on the inside to give is all the juicy details
Yea, but it's so much more fun to read it all
speaking of which, i should go check on that gmail freakout
Nah that petered out because people took it "offline" and "in person"
god damn it I need a play by play!
what gmail freakout??
Check Wayfair
AD had a temper tantrum over outlook being taken away
'After 30 years of using Outlook, I cannot wrap my head around gmail' AWWWW
Yea he's pretty hilarious all around
:crickets:
:crickets:
That is super duper creepy victoria
How is work going Victoria?
This past half hour has felt like 3 hours
Why?
What happened?!?!?!
absolutely nothing CJ
that's the problem
I'm really confused by the recent messages in this channel
Why -&gt; Deja Vu -&gt; Cj -&gt; Extremely relevant DejaVu?
V is due to my orginal which gets deleted by CJ replacement bot
SO I got back to back :dejavu:
that Ash dejavu is kinda creepy in how much it makes sense
lol
:onedayremains:
Also, we have had the bot call <@UK7V13DS7> a terror twice now
THAT'S BECAUSE SHE IS!!!!!
Ohhhh <@UETS9HTSS> what is your take on the changes?
At Wayfair
Line 9126
Still a terror, it's not my fault the bot knows
:hal_9000:
we have officially passed the number of messages that slack is willing to store for us
????
OHHHHH
NICE!
It's going, probably won't have to stay too late in the end because I was able to automate something I was told couldn't be automated
52K messages
How're all the fantastic changes at wayfair?
That's cause people are fools
Haven't been implemented yet
our log is around 14k messages
Fools, but also an older generation who don't know my powers
changes at wayfair?
what changes?
I kinda want to throw DND's log into this channels
you'll get some much weirder deja vu responses
that's for sure
Nirja's email about how OPI and engineering will change
maybe paste it twice
much more murdery
I mean it kinda is already
What's wrong with murdery?
Not sure I received it?
and other gems like:
`People are judgy at Walmart, debra knows`
What if it is a problem?
`Also you all are heavy as fuck, I can carry 1 of you`
`does a triceritops really need utility spells?`
Silence Chaos Seed
actually there isn't too much murder tal
Forwarded the message to you
Oh. I got that; I thought you meant something newer
That's from like 6 days ago
Yea
You said you were bored
You never commented
Figured It would be interesting to hear your response given  you were thinking of going over to engineering
```Therefore, we are going to merge product and engineering into a joint tech team. These combined tech teams will own the product and tech roadmap and prioritization to drive the success of both the platforms that they own and their customers in the business. ```
I mean... maybe....
That's an interesting statement
which may directly impact your thinking
So I was curious
I'm not sure this impacts me
It feels weird for product to be that deeply integrated and not part of a larger PM org
I don't like engineers being owners of the roadmap and prioritization
LOL!
That is firmly PM in my head
I wish there was a summary function 
Also guess what my team is in the finals for hackathon! 
I will gladly never build and update a project plan/roadmap
HAHAHAHAHA
I don't mind doing it
WOOO HOOOOOO!!!!!
You should try that for the next hackathon
I'll whiteboard something and someone else can type it up into documentation
Slack summary functionality
I could make one killer deck for it tho 
you all should check out #cooking-at-wayfair
<@UDDE5960N>
I've never seen Steve's slack photo before

yep; it's quite amusing
You're face is full of innocence and *BANNED WORD*, when people can't see it they see what I see, *TERROR*
DAMMIT CJ YOU JUST GAVE ME A BOT IDEA
/ban terror
/ban TERROR
totally didn't remember I did that
lol
Tehehehehehe
Are you thinking of rewriting the banned word bot?
what if you ban ban?
the ban will be banned
/ban ban
Bomb that just happened
/ban banana
Really Fruits Aysh?
yeah. I cannot edit messages, but the message replacement script works well enough to partially censor sentences
/ban Aysh
/ban dakota
/ban cj
/ban brenden
rude
/ban drew
who is rude?
im surprised, usually the bot deletes the command
Mr Bourdeau
ban
Fial
oh lol bans are broken
Fail
Drew
drew
Bot broke :disappointed:
ban
/ban test

/ban ban

/ban ban

Oh prometheus is not aloud to delete things
ban
/ban ban

I thought megamoji was from the JS script?
I made megamoji use prometheus's token
to that chaos seed reacted with prometheus
We need to give <@ULLQNJ8LX> :hal_9000: powers
ADMIN!
I just promoted him to admin, however it didn't seem to work
I wanted to move the ban commands to prometheus anyway
:hulk-puny_god:
HAHAHAHA I was looking for god power
Also the new emoji thing is weird
/mega bigstrongcry
I still see the old one
my slack hasn't updated

oh that was my phone this morning
I feel like your computer is broken
I mean that's what I'm thinking
and it's only a matter of time before it falls a part
replace the message with *Banned Word*
For extra hilarity, or you can make it like a word of the day too
Pick a random word from a random line in the log, that word is banned for 24 hours. The word rotates daily
That would be awesome
Some days we find it
others we dont
Lol, I've created a monster!
I'll probably build it tomorrow. Gonna need to store it in a new text file so it is persistent

&gt;Bumping again, can we just block this door off as emergency exit only? ^^^
where is this from?
Shared with you
Basic jist is there's a door people use that thumps, and they want it to stop
Doug sat over there before
I think
I think they mean to mark it as emergency exit only
not actually put something in front of it
I just thought it was a poor turn of phrase to say block door and emergency exit in a single sentence
Not sure making it as emergency only would stop people who know it is not an emergecny exit door from using it
Yea I mean they're fucked no matter what
What I'm not sure is why people are using it
elevators dont really seem conveniently located on that floor. I'd take a quick way out if i knew one
Down a creepy death hallway
It's now equidistant between the stairs to 2, and both elevators
.....are you speaking about a real  door or something from your DnD campaign?
It's a mimic
Real door in 500 bolyston that people are complaining about
Although I feel like if they could turn it into a mimic that would solve a lot of problems
#boylston-communityexp
Why? So it would eat the people going through it?
Well then the door wouldn't bang anymore
Sooo problem is solved
I'm not familiar with mimic mating habits enough to offer my opinion
Really the only question becomes is if there was a real emergency which doors will eat you vs. which are real escape routes
:broken_image:
:finedog:
the heck why does that keep happening
the heck why does that keep happening
Because it's spiteful
It used to be that my token didn't change as long as I didn't update my password, however my token has started randomly changing lately
Emojis have been updated
Uh oh, this sounds like some solid chaos being added in.
It's like a scavenger hunt for the word of the day
```if anybody else is getting angry, I recommend taking a break. Gonna follow my own advice before I say something stupid```
#nonwork-politics
nice! needed some entertainment over lunch
paraphrasing: Proper preventative care, diet, and excerise are things that would address the healthcare issue. I have student loans. So  i dont want healthcare for all

:what:
Oh yeah. We had a group of 50 come in last night around 8. They stayed all the way until 1. They also ordered about 2 dozen amaretto sours with the egg white, so that meant we were washing the shakers through the dishwasher constantly and making drinks that are more difficult to make in the first place.
I love that someone was recording this as it happened. Also the complete destruction it suffers.
Wow, that is super duper ignorant
quick screenshot as to how the conversation started, you can imagine how it proceeds from there
Is that on a public channel? 
I don't have time to argue with someone like that
nonwork-politics
I miss the drama
I miss the drama
I made a bad decisions and asked a question
Bad decision or taking one for the team?
Bad decision, because my team doesn't live in that channel
I miss the drama
I meant the chaos monkey team
WE ARE A TEAM
WE ARE A TEAM
WE ARE A TEAM
Ohhh yea
yeah CJ, metabolism is nuanced as hell so I am going to focus on one  aspect of what you said because I CAN
I got involved
LOL!
i could not resist
lol
I feel like they're making excuses
&gt;There are lots of factors that go into nutrition beyond calories, definitely. It also varies based off of goals - i think having meaningful physical goals (especially athletic ones) helps motivate people to make productive changes in their diets, and that doesn't always mean starving yourself
NO SHIT, I'M GOING FOR BIG HITTERS!
I'm sorry if you some gets scurvy from eating nothing but icecream
Next time someone steps out of line tell them this it's called WayFam. And fam means family, and this family we're kind to one another
lol
I cannot to this, thank God I can't respond to them
Yeah BRUH!
I then told her what the basal weight is, i was debating on sorry that you need to eat less for sedentary lifestyle
Interesing
I forgot what word i used
goal achieved. test successful, bot half implemented. Ban currently limited to 1 and manual
current ban: you
NICE
lol
really tempted to upload a troll face emoji as :thuup: to mess with people trying to get :thumbsup:
lol
That's evil and I love it
Wow they live in a fantasy world
I so don't have time to play with these people
What were your comments CJ?
economics say we have to make trade-offs
&gt;NO WE DON'T! WE CAN HAVE EVERYTHING!
Uh, was that a quote from them?
Or is that super :hal_9000:
cj is simply translating what theyre saying
Ugh, I'm so confused on what is going on!
Ah. And what were you responding to about what he said Aysh?
&gt;I don't pay taxes and then tell the maintenance worker on the street that i dont want them to fix the road down the street
Has to be my personally favorite now
OH somebody said that to CJ when he suggested that staying healthy was more dependent on self control and staying ~2000 cal per day
It was mostly a ploy to get cj to reply and say the banned word though
Apparently the word of the day is: y o u
You
Yup
are you sure?
It's a word that is blocked
And I just tested it. So unless you randomized it, I'm sure that is one of the words of the day
You
yeah I just changed it on you don't worry
Figured you would
Yup I seriously hate all of them
They are raging assholes
What are they saying, I'm so lost in the convo
They
lol
They're
Now the word is: t h e y
you having fun buddy
you are too good at this
I'll let someone else fill you in, I'm annoyed at them
eventually the word will be picked randomly. I was intentionally picking words that were likely to be used
And now I have to do my review with my direct
The word will be picked randomly every time?
Its gonna pick a random word from a random line in the history of the channel
and that word will be banned for the day
you
So it re randomizes at the start of every day, or every time it triggers it picks a new word?
start of day
who what where when how why
They
you me I
They
ooooo
I like it
theyre just going back to 'im overweight but imn healthy BMI is incorreect and we ALL KNOW that its SHITTY sicne we are all medical practitioners\
Good job Dakota
each day is now like a mini-game
thanks. Eventually i am also gonna try to get it to work with the /ban command, but thats a problem for another time
found a bug
go type "they" into <#CGNP38P52|dnd>
oh the delete command isn't restricted
That's hilarious
fixed
I like this bot a lot though
same
yeah <@UDDE5960N> gave the the idea ysterday, then suggestied it be random
But BMI is shitty
Like you can prove that in a basic regression model
My professor in my econometrics class literally demonstrated you got a better fitting function by just inversing the bmi calculation
not disagreeing- just dislike that people are harping on about it when there isnt any real relevance to the discussion.
Well it is a good little mini game each day.
They are now discussin if body builders are healthy or not
*t h e y*
Ah, I get what happened from there
I usually ignore the comments and just post in channel or thread
Poll thread!
<@UETS9HTSS> that makes sense that if you're going to cut it diagonally then you would make trapezoids instead. Not sure I know any parents who did that though
yeah, mine always did corner to corner
<@UHQD9J1SL> seriously, what do you do about PB&amp;J or a grilled cheese?
never had cheesy bread?
I just eat the cheese. its a fondue
cut a pbj horizontally and you have two open faced sandwiches
double the quantity!
you can solve world hunger that way
Also, what kind of monsters are y'all, a proper sandwich has filling all the way to the end. Empty corners?
Not how I meant horizontal in the poll, but I get what you mean
how did you mean it in the poll?
Well bread has a top and bottom. It isn't perfectly square. So it would be rectangular, but the curvy end would be on one half and the straight half on the other
I just was generous and assumed it was square
See I just made a sandwich and it was on the mind
I forget the last time I made a sandwich, Im just throwing barely coherent sentences together
Eat it whole you lazy bastards
heresy
Someone need coffee?
Whole? I didn't even put that as an option because it is so heretical
Maybe it's a very small sandwich and the only logical way to eat it would be whole?
Clearly I just now how to take bites of things to chew it into smaller pieces.  Secret arts!
I just dont cut sandwiches. If I do, I cut vertically AND horisontally
cuz then they are just mini sandwiches
lol
Well, this is a bad poll as far as options, but it did generate discussion
I'm cutting Dakota a sandwich into mini triangles in an effort to troll him
I hope you bring it to the next game night
You know what's interesting
is if they're broken up equally, it's no different that the ratio for the whole sandwich
Sum of the parts = whole
Yeah, but some would be crustless and others would be crust heavy
It's a balance by extrenes
I'll screw with him by taking the crust off first
A triangle would encourage you to eat the slice as you would a pizza, meaning there would likely be at least one bite with 0 crust
Though wait, <@UDC4QL95G> you are on a diet and can't have bread right?
<https://media3.giphy.com/media/Otgw312n2weas/source.gif>
well as long as the sandwich is made using almond flour I could eat it
I get Dakota's argument, i don't get drews
There's something I'm missing in that graphic
its the pice that moves to the right
Oh, it grows slightly
I'm posting my favorite fallacy in the channel
1=2 proof
My argument is if you take the 4 mini sandwiches and cut them again into triangles, you get pieces that are from the middle and have no crust, and pieces that have all of it
Oh i didn't realize you were cutting my mini sandwiches. I thought you were blaspheming my mini sandwichtes by creating them with diagonal cuts from the origninal instead of +
QED
The QED goes here <@UDC4QL95G>
Now the whole bread thing makes more sense
I liked my version better
1 = 2. Done
IF A^2 = AB THEN (A^2-AB) = 0
You can't divide by zero
Winner
Generally takes people a minute to realize this depends on dividing by 0
Had a guy show like 10 physics students it, and we all sat there and went "How the fuck did we miss something while you were writing it"
Yeah, doing that from the original would be a little difficult

You broke the fire bot Dakota!
You broke the fire bot Dakota!

What fire bot?
Also there is a new banned word. I set up the automatic refresh, it will refresh around 5:00 daily
they
We may find that we have to ban a set of words instead of just one, since the chance of us actually saying the words is a bit low
Lol
Two examples in my testing were:
kegs
need
agree
it agree replaces agree every agree instance agree of agree the agree word agree (though punctuation breaks the detection)
also, users not opted into chaos will not have their messages replaced or deleted since they dont have bot personas
Fancy
newlines might also break it. dunno
Part of opting into the chaos is the bot persona? Didn't realize that.

Does it matter???
For me? Yeah

I just want to vent, that I think the non-work politics people are crazy
And either they don't understand how reality works, or they're so focused on what they want now, they can't figure out the long term implications of what they want
And clearly anyone with a differing opinion is a fool
AND THAT ATTITUDE ANNOYS ME SOOOO MUCH!!!!
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH PROMETHEUS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH!!!
That's one of the biggest issues with talking/arguing about subjects like politics, some people don't care about logic or open communication, they just want to be right
I just want to get to the right answer, and I don't have it
But everyone together does
Right, but it seems like the people making you angry don't care about togetherness, they seem to want to be right at all costs

On a more positive note, has anyone watched Lucifier on Netflix?
On a more positive note, has anyone watched Lucifier on Netflix?
no but i  hear its pretty good!
I've probably been binge watching it for the last month
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH TO GET THROUGH! IT'S GREAT!!!
And now i'm sad because I finished it last night
watch community
its on hulu
PLEASE watch community
No hulu
Just netflix
too lazy/cheap to get the other streaming sites
watch it elsewhere b because its  amazin :cry:
I'd suggest you watch good omens, but I think it's on prime
That I have but I do most of my watching on the train to and from boston.  I find the prime app kinda frustrating.  I was trying to watch the Jack Ryan series and gave up
I don't doubt it Aysh
Oh, you need to finish jack Ryan. So good
Different from the movies and books, but so good
I'm so sad that clancy stopped writing them, I didn't enjoy the new author's as much
But they remind you of what the cold war actually felt like, I devoured that series
Oh I pretend the new ones are a different series that's just oddly reminiscent of the old ones
Also, if you like cold war novels, check out The Company, long but good read
Yea but I feel like the old ones were more believable in their spook shit, the new ones felt more like TV drama where everything just magically happens
Like in Red Storm Rising (no Jack Ryan but still Clancy) where you have the guy who's like this if fucking weird, and _no one listens to him in time_
Agreed, but since I like spy novels, I still read them all. I just don't consider them the same book series
Ahhhhhh
I like the authenticness of Clancy
authenticness :smile:
any other netflix recommendations? I want somethign chill for the  daily commute
Do you have particular preferences? Most of my catalog tends to be Anime or Sci Fi
anime's fine- ive watched very little- they were both 'horror/ mystery' and i liked them both- but for the commute, something thats dubbed may be better- wont really be able to read subtitles
Pretty sure everything in the US has dubs
Full Metal Alchemist is pretty good, there's 2 of them though, one is `Full Metal Alchemist` and one is `Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood`
`Full Metal` takes places before the managa ends, and does it's own thing after a while.  `Brotherhood` pretty much follows the Manga
lemme check them out :slightly_smiling_face:
They're both worthy of a watch, it just sucks watching the same thing over gain
Let me know when you finish them I have some other recommendations
I just realized the order of people doesn't change
That's because of how they're listed in <@ULLQNJ8LX>
I watched Full Metal and can attest to it is a really good watch. Haven't watched Brotherhood yet just because I just rewatched Full Metal as an adult so waiting for a bit before going through the parts that are the same again
I watched Full Metal and can attest to it is a really good watch. Haven't watched Brotherhood yet just because I just rewatched Full Metal as an adult so waiting for a bit before going through the parts that are the same again
Watched both, and brotherhood hits harder in the feels and I would argue a much more complete story
I would never recommend watching brotherhood then full metal though. Has to be full metal then brotherhood or only brotherhood
Every time I fix this channel, I wind up forgetting to put back the part of the script that messages wayfair...

Alright I think it now ignores punctuation and i I verified that it returned a new word. hopefully stabby works now

Nope I give up
lol don't try to guess the word, I doesn't make sense contextually. I used the banned word intentonally

I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE CROSSING THE STREET!!!! LOOK AT THE LITTLE ANTS!
You gotta do what you gotta do
But I like living too much Victoria, TOO MUCH TO DEPEND ON FOOLS!
I'm disappointed in you CJ, if you walk with purpose the cars will stop
I have no idea what this in reference too... but I kinda want to play this game now
lol
is that your screeen?
I still have the old emojis search so it hasn't updated yet
yes, that was my screen
That's kinda funny, I have had no issue nearly that interesting
I like how ever time you move the mouse it tries to refresh
to be fair, it happened when I was installing windows updates
so it might not be slack's fault
lol
Ohhhh windows
busy busy busy
What are you doing Aysh that keeps you so busy?
meetings!
also freinds from pittsburgh have visited for the weekent (yay)
YEA!!!
weekend
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY YEAH!
Not soon enough?
Well hopefully the meetings stop
I like the fact there's 4 :party-pr:
We can watch it together! Sam and I both want to see it
Messages Wayfair???
What were they using before? We were using Git when I was on BI before I left.
New trailer??? :woot:

Morning! 
Open question for the engineers.  What is the best way to abstract conditional function modifiers?
Context: for shits and giggles I'm coding out :dnd: in python.  Why because I just want get better at building code. I basically got stuck at how to include :dnd: class level functionality because it modifies a lot of stuff.  I was thinking about just adding wrapper functions to handle all the edits.  But I stoopid and don't know how to actually implement something like that

But I stoopid and don't know how to actually implement something like that
That's quite an ambitious project
It's more fun trying to think through how to do it properly, will I succeed probably not.  Will I learn stuff about coding, damn straight
Yeah, I'd be extremely impressed if whatever you develop works as a book replacement
You'll learn regardless though
Avrae had a team of devs to do just that, and it got acquired by dndbeyond
I think the part i need to figure out is how much I want it to calculate on the fly vs. store info
For example: AC is something most people will store as a value, however it depends on your dex (for medium/light) and armor type
So do you dynamical determine AC every time, or do you only recalculate when you make a change
I think for my simplistic coding skills, dynamically calling it is easier because I don't have to build checks in
dynamically determine is my preference
there are quite a few spells that affect AC
lol
there there there there there there there there there there
you found the word of the day
got 'em
ayyyy im glad it happened naturally for once
I mean there is pretty common word
Well, previous words weren't so obvious. like Stabby
true enough
I requested a crudely drawn version of :hal_9000: to be :hal_8000: to indicate stupid AI/robot behavior

I only saw it twice

<@UDC03KCGK> there your schedule like for tomorrow?
<@UDC03KCGK> there your schedule like for tomorrow?
hooo boy
<@UDC4QL95G> you done fucked up
there's the third
If I had to guess, it would be `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error>`
ehhhh, no iterative loops in our service
it just listens to a call, and responds, it's more likely the server is glitchy and doesn't think it completes the call and sends a second time
Slack is acting up a bit for me, it might just be slack retyring events or something
but like cj said, there are no loops in the logic anymore
but like cj said, there are no loops in the logic anymore
noteably this all started when I deleted my message before your bot could
but yes, slack is also shitting itself
but like cj said, there are no loops in the logic anymore
confirmed using the logs, Slack is resending events... wtf
its usually unnoticable, but when an event triggers additional dialog, it becomes obvious
cant tell if :this: is a bug or unintended feature

<@UETS9HTSS> <@UDC03KCGK> <@UDC4QL95G> to try and make doug's life easier, I'm assuming after the 3 of you are done thrashing me, we find an nearby town to recover in, and then head to the zoo right?
the zoo?
I forget what that is
entrance to the underdark where we can learn more about the faceless
but what if you win?
supposedly we weren't strong enough before, but we're going to power spike 5 now
optimistically I might get one of you... If i'm lucky
And assuming you guys roll shit, I'm pretty doug's gonna DM thorium into losing
Sure, works for md
To answer your question <@UETS9HTSS>, i am good to play DnD tomorrow. Was able to lock in the day in my schedule
Someone posted this in #nonwork-foodies: <http://www.staceysnacksonline.com/2019/04/omg-ottolenghis-baked-rice-w-tomatoes.html>
My first thought was that the `OMG` in the title makes me less inclined to read that :thinking_face:
What does that say about me?
I did choose to read it
And now I'm sad person
Because this is literally someone else recipe she posted because she likes it
but yes, non internet savy people love click bait titles hence why they're still in use
Ex. Banks *_hate him_* find out why here
I saw `Baked Rice` and immediatly decided I wasn't interested
He's not dumbass you can be too, by following these 10 steps
Though the title is kinda like all our marketing emails
but without emojis
<@UK7V13DS7> I need a rice expert to weigh in on baking rice
SAME TARGET AUDIENCE!
Actually on second thought, this is probably better for <#CKQ4NGF24|food>
`YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY CLEARANCE!!!`
Clearly we are superior with our use of emoji's
`Alllll the KNIFE SETS`
Dakota are you sad that middle age women fall for the stupidest shit?
I'm sad
too much faith in humanity Brenden?
no, I'm just disappointed by how stupid people are
no, I'm just disappointed by how stupid people are
I think being disappointed in how stupid people are, is the same as having too much faith in them in the first place
I disagree
I don't have faith in them to be smart
I'm just perpetually disappointed by their lack of intelligence
Are you still talking about middle aged women or people in general?
I'm still going with you have faith in the fact they are _smarter than they actually are_
I think in this case it's both Victoria, we're just calling out middle aged women because that's Wayfair and the cooking ads target market
I'm now talking about people in general
so we have better reference points for making the arguement
but our target market is what sparked this conversation, yes
Now, tell Brenden he has too much faith in humanity because he's perpetually disappointed
this made my day
I kinda want papa roach to make a song like this
Just mocking the shit out of trump
aren't there already like a billion of those
aren't there already like a billion of those
dammit prometheus calm down
Slack and <@ULLQNJ8LX> are fighting
aren't there already like a billion of those
Implemented possible fix for multi-processing events
not sure what is causing them, but hopefully it will no longer happen
there it is
looks good
:salute_cap:
lol
there Can there I there break there it there ? there
therethere
No?
'there
dubious
'there'there'there'there'
`there`
HAHAHA I like how the text edits get all messed up
```there```
Ummm??
WTF?
BUG
I win!
<@UDC4QL95G> I broke it
I'm not sure if you're a good person, or a terrible person right now
&gt;there
_there_
*_there_*
MORE BUGS
*there*
_there_
```there```
hmmm so slack considers this_one_word apparently
yea but python shouldnt
well its just regex
and i don't want to build a super complex regex string
`\b({0})\b` works well enough
_there_
alright underscores fixed
you need to use * Dakota
Wildcards save lives
I need more than a wildcard
I dont want therefore to be deleted for example
I do!
eh i feel like a word should be banned.
I mean if that's what your going for then yes, that makes the regex WAY harder
*there*
*there*
`there`
```there```
No more loop holes Brenden
I'm slightly more through than dakota
Although he gets credit for building it, I just get credit for stopping you from breaking it and annoying him
i mean in a perfect world t.h.e.r.e would also get deleted
nah that's way to malicious
bthereb
I just made sure and format of the banned word gets caught
See this is why I want to wild card it
bthere works just fine too
_*there*_
**there**
can character that isn't ~`\b_* will cause 2there to show up
you added an extra space around redacted
does that count as a bug
Yes, now it'll always show as ~*redacted*~
lol * isn't a wildcard
you are looking for the character *
Format doesn't show if there's something still next to it
<@UETS9HTSS> I was fixing this issues
```*_~there~_*```
yea cause that's how you *bold* things in slack
you totally added an extra space
I need * not the wild card
I agree I showed you why
oh
I see
there_we_go
hmmm thats interesting
'there'we'go'
_there_
'there'
there_
"there"
"there
there"
_there
Weird the _ shouldn't fool the regex anymore
_there there_
bug bug
I win
I swear to god, I'm gonna make it wild cards just to stop brenden!
you broke it cj
no there_there is all one word
*there there*
~there there~
what i can't figure is why _there or there_ works but not _there_
but not what?
:troll_dance:
_there
_there
_there
Ummmm that's weird
_there
there_
_there
Alright I feel beter that it works now
stupid ? regex
_there there_
_there *there there*_
:hmm:
~there there~
~*there~ _there* there _
not bad
&gt;there'
&lt;there&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;there
&gt;&gt;&gt;
there
therefore
HAH
I WIN AGAIN
uhhh
lolololthereololol
1. there
2. there
3. ???
4. Profit
aww
:blank:there:blank:
:there:
:therefore:
it now kills emojis
btw
does that count as a bug?
or is that a feature
:john_cena:there:john_cena:
*there*
what are you typing to get bullets?
```there```
ctrl shift 8
ooooooo
that's some super weird functionality
Ohhhh you are causing an exception elsewhere in the script due to the non-standard character
That is an issue with reading encoded characters and i dont really know whow to fix that
"there"
`there"
`there"
```there*```
```\b[^A-Za-z0-9]?(there)[^A-Za-z0-9]?\b```
new regex
lol it got redacted
cool
I now have a working workaround to your bot
if I want to tell someone the word of the day
i suppose, though no bots will work on it

Just had to know what today's redacted statement was?
wanted to see if it changed since yesterday
since it was suppposed to update at midnight <@UDC4QL95G>
WELL DID IT?!!?
I grew up on the streets but I am not a .... Oh wait I have slight of hand, and stealth, and lockpicking skills? Ok, yeah, I'm a thief.
nope
it flipped to what when dakota and I were talking around 5:30pm yesterday
hmm it should have, wonder what happened
forgot, the time I saved is a time saved, not an expiration date. New word banned and this one should reset at midnight for real
:suspicious:

See I think if your'e going that far, that metaphysically you're random chance anyway and it really doesn't matter
Oh, I never said it matters
Doesn't change my thoughts on this
<https://phys.org/news/2015-09-youre-irrational-quantum-probabilistic-human.html>
<@UDDE5960N> are you arguing that the poll is not imactful enough cause a change?
like, what if you had an epiphany halfway through reading the poll
You're basically just a probability simulator, which means you don't change, the probabilities do
Okay, by impacting the probabilities, you're now a different person
aren't people defined by their actions? and the probability deceides actions, so changing the probability changes the actions you take
Yes, but the way in which you evaluate the probabilities has no changed, or said another way, if you change the software and not the hardware do you have a new computer?
I say no, it has all the same spec it had before\
this is not a giga emoji
<@UDC4QL95G>
:bug:
It's not coded correctly probably
?
giga moji's should have a 2 by 2 coding
oh, yeah
that was silly of me
Makes sense I too was confused
wait... why does :big_lisus_1-1:  look different here and in #nonwork-emoji
wait hold up, why does this channel have so many more big-lisus
/mega big_lisus
????
there should be way more than that...
/mega big_li
Dakota has lost his mind
:big_lisus_1-1::big_lisus_1-2::big_lisus_1-3::big_lisus_1-4::big_lisus_1-5:
:big_lisus_2-1::big_lisus_2-2::big_lisus_2-3::big_lisus_2-4::big_lisus_2-5:
:big_lisus_3-1::biglis-3:2
ohhhh ok
though it looks awful
those line returns are terrible
also, the mega command does not work for emojis that exist in this channel but not in wayfair
thus why it stops :lol:
/mega big_lis
fixed
interesing
so if you rebase your branch onto master, you have to close your pull request and make a brand new one
meaning any existing reviews on the PR are moot
Dakota
Is that english?
I know what pull request and master is, and that's about it
ohhh and branch
rebase is when you get all the master changes, and then apply your changes
merge is you just kinda squish all the changes together
rebase is what you used to do, and keeps it so you are always making your changes on top of the latest changes to master
in my case, I got a code review, and wanted to fix one comment, so I pulled down the latest changes on master to get my branch up to date
but doing so made it impossible to push my branch, so all the reviews on the PR are gone
As much as experiences help shape you as a person, there's a difference between what defines you as a person and how you react to a particular experience. Just because that experience happened, doesn't mean it was impactful enough to change you, just something that you dealt with and promptly moved on from with the skills you already have.
It's the same as trying to say you have a new car because you gave it an oil change.
I but even small things that appear irrelievant at this point in time can sometimes be randomly remembered in the future, shaping a decision
Sure, but the way you handle a single decision using a particular data point doesn't define you. You're still using the same logic paths but with new data points.
Back to the car, if I take a car that has a crappy engine, and drop in a V8 or a hemi, I've radically changed the car. 
If I give the steering wheel a crappy fur cover, it's still the same car, just a random accessory.
I think the car is a bad analogy because it's physical
That's like saying wearing a glove makes me a different person
That bot really did not like the walk out, I've seen this multiple times now
to me it's significant digits, most experiences fall below the threshold
a certain few fall above
but if you accumulate enough experiences and compare them to where you were before then your different
Otherwise what you are saying about this minor experience making you a different person is in the same level as I am a different person because some skin cells died and I woke up this morning
DUDE I LOST AN EYE LASH, BRAND NEW PERSON!
Anyone ever been to Asheville, NC? Looking for recommendations.
airfare is cheap, so I'm building a map of stuff to do there
Ashville is amazing, what kind of vacation are you wanting? It's in Appalachia so close to great camping and hiking and has a few breweries and wineries close
breweries, wineries, distilleries, hiking, zip lining, pinball museum, anything else interesting
only if you realize that you lost one
if one just falls off and you don't notice, you're likely no different
Yea but I think that's the point around reading a sentence makes you different that I disagree with
Just because you consciously interact with something doesn't change you enough to justify that you've changed
who says you have to justify that you've changed
it might be imperceptible
doesn't mean you haven't changed
No one ever clarified `completely different person` as a criteria for this argument
which to me is saying i'm a different person for breathing air
Or that the person who exists outside of this moment isn't real because now he's just a shared public memory
Or possible the whole universe is one giant simulation in which nothing exists
#2 &amp; #3 are different arguments, which I also have opinions on, but that's neither here nor there
RE: #1
breathing air could have an impact; are you smelling a fart?
did you notice a smell
or did it bypass your consciousness and you noticed nothing?
is there tear gas in that air?
tear gas doesn't change the person i am, it makes me react, but it doesn't not change who I am
Will the experience with tear gas, change how I react? Maybe/maybe not
does it make you fear your government, could it possibly have an impact on some future behavior you might exhibit?
I mean in Hockey we were always taught to finish a check, why because maybe the next time you come in a on a guy he starts to panick
I mean you're basically arguing that any change in state is a "new" you
yep
which is basically the same as saying me before and after a piss are different people
what's your point?
Why because when I'm making a decision I have different things on my mind and therefore my different decisions
And I would argue that doesn't make you a _different person_ because you have not changed, the factors going into the decision have
I guess that depends on how you define person
because clearly that's where we differ on this subject
That's my point, i think your definition of a person is too loose allowing for absurdity
which is basically anything makes me different from moment to moment regardless of if it raises to the level of consciousness
if you take the you from right now, one from an hour ago, one from a day ago, week, month, etc and put them in the exact same situation, at some point they'll start acting differently
in some situations, maybe they don't act differently until the you from a year ago
in some, maybe it's 5 seconds ago
yea but I would even argue that making a different decision doesn't make me a different person, because the evaluation criteria is different
and that's where our definitions differ
this has become circular
Once again, the me before the pissing vs. me after pissing only differ in our, I NEED TO FIND A BATHROOM RIGHT NOW!
I don't have anything new to add
That covers most of what they're known for, but their downtown area has great little shops for perusing and good restaurants that I don't remember the names of, but there is a coffee shop in am old double decker bus
If you say so, I guess my question is how do you define a person, just by if they'll make the same decision?
how could I forget food?
Such that fools who don't learn remain the same person, but wise men are never the same person
"A wise man only makes a mistake once, a fool over and over again"
My beginning statement was that `a person is a product of their experiences`, which is sort of what sparked this
Not all experiences is my argument
Your argument has failed to change my mind ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Valid

typos on ironic/ sarcastic statements are the worst
Even Prometheus is calling you out Aysh
haters gonna hate
Prometheus has long since gained sentience, his chaotic tendencies are no longer attributed to my own
hmmm I don't think the banned word is going to be used today, but it is kinda funny
Is the word "cj'?
Technology is getting really sophisticated now
Dakota, did you break Aysh?
Because this is really really weird
We haven't reached T-800 yet Victoria, they don't bleed real blood
Maybe this is when we realize Aysh is actually a robot
I swear she's a real person I've met in real life
First, have you seen her bleed. Second are you sure it was real blood. Third, just because you haven't seen it doesn't make it less possible
Yes, but you enable additional chaotic powers to him
And that should be attributed to you
You're like the uncle who gives children candy and squirt guns and laughs

ok promethus is back. that was a pain
we ran out of disk space
whoops
also i found out that the lack of disk space somehow made multiple servers listening to the events, thus the double events
WE NEED A BIGGER SERVER!
i'd have to pay for that
booooooo
also the issue was that the logfile was automatically being tracked in the git history
LOL!
meaning every update to it was logged as a new commit...
Do we get anything else if we upgrade?
not really. the server would have 100% uptime, but we got around that with using python and saving to file
I kinda wanna add a DB to prometheus though. getting tired of writing to text files
we're gonna learn so much just to troll each other
though i found out the file list only shows files tracked by git, meaning you can no longer view or edit the log

Dakota is trying to get access to new tools at wayfair
He's GOING FOR IT!
I wanted to drop the whole issue since I already have it installed, but a non-engineer is really hyped to make it available to people and created a google form and everything
so i'm just along for the ride
What tool?
What thread?
BetterTouchTool, its a nonwork email he is referencing
got it
why is non-political not an option
I muted nonwork when I went to gmail
yeah, it should be
Because technically you're still political
you classify as libertarian dakota
As per most engineer's you walking stereotype
there are 2 problems with that satement
1. the poll is for how you SELF identify
2. what the heck is libertarian
Clearly if you're in #nonwork-politics, you have... specific feelings you want everyone to know of
but i'm in there for drama
clearly being apolitical is anti-thesis for being in the there
Which is why I have it muted because  you tell me when there's something fun to read
I just check in once a day to see if there is any yelling
omg.... I just realized that the main spokesperson for the #activism stuff is my QA tester...
I never made the connection
Rachel?
sucks for you
As to why you're libertarian, you are very much laissez faire, from what i've gathered in our conversations, which best aligns with libertarian, who are everyone should do whatever the fuck they want and life will sort itself out
TIL I'm libertarian
Is there a buzzfeed quiz for this? :sarcasm:
Ehhhhh, but your not.  You believe that businesses should act ethically
I do?
Sorry it's hard to put into words, libertarian is like 2 steps short of anarchy
My take away is you believe we should have laws and ethics, a libertarian is more of the opinion that `free market will solve all that so there's no reason to have it`
ahh, I see
Then I suppose I'm not
Yea, I mean all 3 of us are similar we're just slightly different on the spectrum
I'd probably be the most socialist leaning of all of us
nah for some reason I mixed up profile pictures in my head
im safe
I think Rachel is just loud
@egood is who I associate with being the main spokesperson
Nah I don't think I'm libertarian
Not sure where you fall then
I think i'm totally apolitical
the country can run itself however it wants as long as I can keep on doing what I am doing now. beyond that /shrug
it's fine, I mixed people up. She is just vocal in the channel
Right, but that you should be left alone is a very libertarian stance.  Let me do my thing, is like what they stand for
I understand you're not noisy and you don't push it on others, and therefore you feel apolitical
The difference is that I don't bring other people into that equation
It's the difference between a preacher and practicer of religion in my opinion
Your both insert religion here, one of you i like and one of you I want to punch in the face
as long as I peronally am able to keep doing what I am doing, I care very little, if at all, whether or not other people are
WTF Dakota
Did you have a stroke writing that?
probably
I know only 2 stances - For the greater good Or the Lesser Evil
I act in the present, so its "well that sounds like it sucks" and "go for it"
I don't know if that's Aysh having a real opinion or just being a bot
are you saying bots cant have opinions
:nike_just_do_it:
thats racist
:suspicious:
its harry's birthday!
:question_what:
POTTAH!
<@UDC03KCGK>
The eyes do not know you. But do you know yourself?

<@UDD45P5A9>
The old bide their time.
Do not fear them. You will be amongst them soon.

<@UK7V13DS7>
The trees are listening.
You memories haunt the night.

<@UDBV9N1E0>
The tormented are not what they seem.
Don't look away. Your time is coming.

<@UJTEHPEPL>
The young are not what they seem. You aren't young either.
Sleep lightly.

<@UHQD9J1SL>
Your enemies approach
Prepare. They are almost upon you.

<@UETS9HTSS>
The old yearn for destruction
Give up. Your time is out.
Special care was also taken to not include me, since I had spoken in the thread
:golfclap:
Or me
hmmm
Good morning all :wave:
lol drews breaks the normal form of the statements
lol looks like another day of undefined behavior
I'm on the struggle bus this morning
Soooo last night's party went well I take it
So does Rich's
Because anyone coming into this thread now will have NO IDEA what's going on
:a_plus_grade:
:goldstar:
My new team really likes alcohol
I'm pretty sure this is Aysh, only because I don't know all of these phrases
:perfect:
nice try
I think the lag makes it even more funny
and I would have gone with "your time is almost up"
I agree with you, but I think the order is right
Yea, I mean all 3 of us are similar we're just slightly different on the spectrum
on the bright side, the ban switched at midnight
that reactji is gonna be gone when prometheus catches up again
Who took over my slack profile? :@
I see you found my :app: emoji.
I was trying to make it match, but didn't have much success.
OH MAN I WAS SUPER CONFUSED !!!!!
It was so blurry
Aysh is going full AI on us
I've come up with a crazy way to make things customizable! In Python, I can add functions to lists, so if I store different lists that affect types of rolls I should be able to handle most requirements
For the :dnd: project
I just wanted to tell someone
Woot!
is  this summer party worth going to?
You're not a drinker right? Also you're vegetarian right?
yes and mostly yes- ive been eating more seafood of late
I hope you like drunk people with your veggie burgers then!
My understanding is like the bar crawl, but all in one very distant location where no one has to move
lol
ok im not going :smile:
Sounds like everyone else still at wayfair in the channel is going so you could hang out with them
who?
Dakota and Brenden are going
I don't know about Doug/Marla/Dave/Rich/Will
I'll likely be hanging out with my team most of the time
I wouldnt impose :princess:
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That one is good
and priceless
`Next time on when engineer's talk to non-engineer's!`
actually i was talking to an engineer
YOU TELL HIM PROMETHEUS!
Correction:
`When Engineers talk to Engineer wannabes`
Did you explain what a MAC address is
Cause I have no idea, I just know they exist and matter
Nah j just posted a link to how to find it
I don't really know what they are either
Everyone stumbling in the dark
~*REDACTED*~
So what was causing the Aysh posts that looked like a bot but without the app tag? Or is she just adding to the chaos?
she set her status to the :app: emoji
Everything gets redacted today!
No I mean before she did that
Like there are the ones that are Aysh vs Ayshu
Do you tell refected bot to pick from a list of common words?
It picks from this channel's history
a random word, from a random line
And it landed on the?
so more common words are more likely to be banned
Ah, just increased probability
tomorrow the word `exist` could be banned
today it just happened to pick a super common word
Anyway, so was Aysh trolling us by reposting random old messages?
yeah. Also prometheus died this morning so there was som undefined behavior
Ok, well it clearly was working on CJ and me
Jeeves?
Will it answer my questions if I ask it something?
Could call it Moneypenny
Or Alfred
What's today's quarterly party? Summer one, but where is it these days?
Seaport block party
if you have your badge you could stop by
nah all it does is post emojis
its still prometheus
I mean you can program it to do that too if you wanted
At some point I was looking to see if some sort of NLP api existed somewhere to actually answer questions
There should be some python packages for NLP
They took it when I left
jerks
I think I still have mine drew, you just need a wig and glasses if you want to borrow
Guess who just checked into the ER
So much for going to the quarterly party
Um... what?
Why are you in the ER?
WHAT DID YOU DO BRENDEN!?!?!
Nothing haha
Went to the clinic because I had some swelling
They redirected me to the ER
ohhh.....
I apparently have a hernia or something
JESUS!
You're gonna be a broken old man dude
What the fuck were you lifting that caused that?
OMG  :open_mouth:
Post-ultrasound apparently they're not too concerned, it's minor
were you in so mch pain you had to go to the ER though?
Damn dude, sorry you're having such a day!
Climbing related possibly?
What's a hernia
Your organ sticks through an abnormal opening in muscle or connective tissue.
Usually something like an intestine sticking through some abdominal muscle
Oh jeez
Don't worry, only a little bit of brenden is leaking. He'll live
<@UETS9HTSS>
<@UDC4QL95G> Programming is hard
<@UDC03KCGK> it's show time!
<@UDBV9N1E0>
<@UDD45P5A9>
<@UHQD9J1SL>
<@UJTEHPEPL>
THERE'S NO GOOD THE SUN WILL COME OUT TOMORROW!
<@UDC4QL95G> redact broke the is still banned
something changed in slack
Did it just roll out to you?
No, went to a clinic and they told me to go to the ER
Almost zero pain
Mild ache/discomfort
I think I sneezed too hard :sweat_smile:
Or held one in I shouldn't have
A bit of tissue is sticking out of the abdominal cavity
Could be fat, could be an organ; depends
If it's an organ it's much more serious; mine's just a bit of fat I think
Doesn't have to be an organ; that's just the more severe case
yes
ahhhh it's been changed for a while for me
the
The ban updaed just fine
the
You sure it's not updating at 9 am?
Oh i know what went wrong
so the banlist can't just "update" at midnight unless some event causes prometheus to wake up
so because I called it
it updated
and I was just too fast for the update?
nah I was dumb and have the file record the current time when the ban is updated, and then expire the ban after 24 hours
so the trigger event happened to happen at 8:45, meaning it wouldn't expire for 24 hours since then
i think *~REDACTED~* ban worked fine
Aysh, just straight evil
WHAT!
It's ok, we accept your chaos
It's ok, we accept your chaos
ITS FRIDAY!
WHAT!
ITS FRIDAY!
This is very true
Are you coming to Hot Pot On tuesday?
It's ok, we accept your chaos
<@UHQD9J1SL> said she can't make tuesday D&amp;D, so either she's skipping D&amp;D for hot pot, or has other plans already
Ban should correctly expire at midnight every day now
WILL IT DAKOTA!!! WILL IT!?!?!
maybe ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
she's ignoring us now
WTF ARE YOU UP TO???
I have dance classes!!!!
I was yelling at Dakota
Sorry for the confusion
How're you doing Brenden?
Lol
wait, what were you yelling at me for?
<#CLY649L00|000000>
Oh yeah lol
get r3kt
For some reason I got dragged in there
yeah I did that specifically to confuse you
Mission Successful asshole
though the channel exists to combat this ting
<#CLY649L00|000000>,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000
?????
Notice how it has no button to switch sidebar theme
#000001,#000001,#000001,#000001,#000001,#000001,#000001,#000001
see
No thanks, I like the one you already gave me
!#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000
Not that hard to circumvent
well you're both evil now
huh interesting. not sure why the exclamation poiint changes anything
s#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000,#000000
any character not pound works
I like #FFFFFF better
#FFFFFFF,#FFFFFFF,#FFFFFFF,#FFFFFFF,#FFFFFFF,#FFFFFFF,#FFFFFFF,#FFFFFFF,
What was the context 
trup
#nonwork-politics
Is he supportive of trump?
no
nope
Also how am I an app now lol
you used the banned word
of
found the banned word
O_f is banned? Lol
yes
buess so
it's a random word of the day
it changes at midnight
Anyway, she just auto jumps to trying to murder you rather than understanding
I think non-work should be renamed not-working 
Which is usually true for me when I’m on the channel 
Lol same with this channel
the continuation of the conversation for those who are interested
Can we discuss ```As she has mentioned in the past, she has some pretty good reasons to permanently be pissed off-- cut her some slack please? (clarification: directed at Abe)``` I'm pretty sure having reasons to be pissed off at somebody is not a reason to publicly jump on anybody who appears to be on that person's side.
I have no idea what her reasons are
Do the reasons matter?
No, I'm saying that excuse does nothing for the people with no context
especially if they're not willing to explain it
Dammit wayfair I need more drama, Its Friday
How can someone even validate that excuse
because clearly when something bad happens in your life you can treat everyone else like shit
I don't think I've met rachel, but her slack persona rubs me the wrong way
almost always
I have yet to meet a time it hasn't
These days I dont even read the text in channels
I just look for
It's sad that's a good indication that something worth reading is going down
Lol
yea they got quiet
they are onto me
Quick! Give them some shit code to throw them off the trail
lol I just threw him to #slack-help
Oh are you doing games today? I have a 3:30-4
Dunno, its not close enough to that time to find out
That's fine just giving you the heads up I would like to know but will probably be AFK
cool, I'll ping you if we do play. We will be in the usual place
It looks like we are likely to play something at 4
games are happening?
Generally the engineers Dakota works with do games on friday afteroon's and I'll join them when I can
:this:
CLOPIN is a thing. When you close the restaurant the night before but then also have to do the opening shift the next day, typically the morning. 
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDC4QL95G> <@UJTEHPEPL>
Good Morning Everyone!
Summon the Silent
Good morning!
it has dawned!
I wasn't silent, you were silent! No one wanted to talk this weekend. I was so lonely :(
I was in the forest all weekend and had no cell service which I blame on my silence
^that's new
Wtf? I left this workspace and then I got a ping...
That's actually very very old. Probably the first bot we made for this channel (we referring to Dakota or CJ, the ones who actually build shit in here).
:a_blob_confused:
"Spartans never die. They are only ever 'Missing in action..'"
You never left after the Walkout?
Or was it you never left after the banjo-kazoie announcement
Anyway, the last time you joined, you never elft
I think that bot is 1/2k and only in threads
yea something like that
ah i see.
I still don't understand where the comment came from
I can check the log
if you care that much
OHHHHHHHHHHH
I thought it was Real Drew not :dejavu:
oh yeah thats a bot
lol
busy weekend dakota?
Not at all. That was just the first thing that came up when I giphy'd monday
I did see Hobbs and Shaw though
Ohhhh how was it? I really didn't watch any of the fast and the furious past the first one
I enjoyed it quite a bit. They took a turn away from the typical Fast and Furious themes, and basically just tried to make it as funny as possible
And plenty of superhuman feats of strength from The Rock as well
ummm ok....
Dakota do you have something to tell us?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
it's shocking to see how much he's changed
So glad he started doing movies
its called  'aging'
Not even aging, just like how he's essentially grown as an actor
quetsion abotu comp changes at wayfair- if they give us the numbers in October- when does it go into  effect?
did you get a promotion?
lol nope
my reports were asking
it goes into effect in october as well i believe
as- wish it were prorated by  /shrug
/shrug
No company prorates that I've seen unless they fucked up implementation and owe you
So generally get comp statement -&gt; 2 weeks later bigger check
ugh- annoying but ok
that seems like a long time from now
I just got my review
happy with it?
yeah, it's fine
kind of irrelevant
my pay changes in a week
not october
since I'm changing roles
oh is that confirmed???
whatre you gonn be now?
CEO
it's compounded by the fact they sped up the L1-L3 reviews to be faster
but everyone's gonna get comp adjusted at the same time
And they're just finalizing L4+ reviews this week
Delivery for next week
Our adjustment will probably come late august/early sept
I haven't figured out what my job title will be, but I'll be in PPD, Competitive Intelligence Data Acquisition sprint line

/mega pb-dance
wait... :wat:
lol
I was there in person for that dance
I spent the weekend editing an eleven  page resume to 2
You should edit it to 1
They aren't going to any career fairs anytime soon so thought it be ok
also, at 11 pages, it's not a resume anymore
It's a bot overwhelmer
That has every possible combination of buzz words
NEVER MEANT TO BE SEEN BY HUMAN EYES!
that's when you put buzzwords in 1 point font in the footer
lol
My 1 hour meeting lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes and now it's the end of the day.
well
What was that shit show about
It was my favorite kind of meeting. Arguing about implementation
Also, if you do that at 4 tomorrow, we already got Rich to replace your ass
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I ain't missing hot pot fool
is rich not joining us anyway?
He is
I'm just saying he can fill in for you in a pinch
Have you called for a reservation
or is that a "wait until tomorrow" kinda thing
Nah, I'm waiting until this all falls apart when we show up tomorrow
:ohno:
<@UDC03KCGK> save us
This is Mei's adventure, I'm just along for the ride
Use your bartender magic
Drew is kinda an overachiever though
So what are you trying to implement and who's a fool?
EU sms,  and it was more me spitballing how to implement it and finding edge cases
Edge cases, the bane of all existences
Fail gracefully is a key
Nah, just never fail
easy
Fools are too ingenious for you dakota!
TOO INGENIOUS!
I made a cocktail this weekend; came out pretty well
It was called a cactus berry
Is there more context to this?
Like you're trying to be a bartender or something?
Also it sounds yummy what's in it?
nah, had roommate brunch at home and one of them cooked, so I made a cocktail
Ahhhhhh
Nice
and agave syrup instead of simple
ummmm... there's no berries in there?
correct haha
I didn't come up with the name
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<https://tenor.com/view/the-ringer-when-the-fuck-did-we-get-ice-cream-gif-5417477>
lemons and limes are berries.
<https://giphy.com/gifs/emma-mila-stauffer-VeB9ieebylsaN5Jw8p>
```Yes, all citrus are berries. The definition of a berry is that the outside of the ovary is fleshy and it does not have a pit (like a peach) and the fruit comes from one flower. ... The definition of a berry exactly fits the lemon```
:til:
<https://giphy.com/gifs/star-shooting-the-more-you-know-3og0IMJcSI8p6hYQXS>
TIL
:til:
This logic also means bananas are berries, strawberries are not
yup
<https://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-2wSaulb0fsDydh0IoB>
have you had a banana with a seed in it? theyre like straight up sugar :heart:
I declare myself the authority on fruit, given my tropical origin
*exotic origin
That's hilarious that you made a cactus berry. I literally found this 2 weeks ago and made it at the bar a few days ago. Came out tasting like Tequila sangria
Did you find it on Mr. Boston?
Good Morning Brenden!
Good Morning Aysh!
Good Morning <@UDC4QL95G> <@UDC03KCGK> <@UJTEHPEPL>!
Good Morning <@UDBV9N1E0>!
Good Morning <@UDD45P5A9>!
morning has brokennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
?????
Like you're broken, or you have to deal with the morning
dawn break
also- my neck is sprained and im staying home
also - 'Japan is inherently racist - I know from documentaries' greeted me on nonwork politics this morning:smile:
WTF were you up to last night/this morning
ummm yea <@UDC4QL95G> non-work politics went off the deep end this morning
This... this is amazingly bold and so wrong
I don't understand people
im impressed by the confidence, though
The confidence is sky high
what ever happened to the fantasy football for games club? is that still a thing?
there wasn't really enough interest
four people on the wayfair instance of slack expressed interest
maybe two more on here
not going to try to play a 6 team league
I don't even know what an appropriate league size is
I kinda wish I had the ability to plot activity level in non-work politics/activism with some other wayfair data point
Because it was rediciously busy between 8:30 and 9, and then died
probably around 8-10
12-14 starts getting iffy
Awww that's sad we only missed by like 2
I disagree
10-12
14 is iffy
wow, Aysh was generous in her censorship of how bold a statement she was making
its even worse than I originally assumed
i have taken part in alot of 8 team leagues so i guess i am just more used to them
how is this person allowed to function like this?
i do find 10 is a good number though
I think that comment is the first one that is potentially HR worth
she just made an openly racist statement about the Japanese, didnt she?
How are they able to keep paying stuff like that?
I mean firing her would be a nighmare...
she is already known to be very vocal with connections to the people running the concentration camp nightmare. It would be really easy to spin this up as getting fired over the walkout
reprimanding her shuldnt be
i used 'curses' on a channel once as an expression of disappointment and was reported about it to my manager
please go respond to that  message :confused:
UGH RAGEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Is there more drama?
or is it just that sort of day
its just the same thing- and im churning what i think are  'equivalent' statements in my head and its making me mad
Wtf did I miss today?
lol just the 'Japan is racist' rant . I am overreacting
Please pardon my white boy ignorance: can you address which parts are totally off base if she had instead written it as "There is a racisim problem to outside cultures held by a proportion of the Japanese problem. Similarly, there is enough of a sexual harassment/assault problem that in some districts the city runs trains specifically for women."
<@UDD45P5A9> <@UDDE5960N> <@UDC4QL95G>
My takeaway is that the Japanese bashing feels a little close to home because India struggles with similar things
Which is why Aysh might say 'equivalent' statements because you can take out Japan and replace it with India very easily with regards to Rape/Corruption culture
I've played in 10 team leagues the most. I find 12 would be a bit more challenging in the right ways.
I take issue with the generalization of it. Your version' of the statement is much more appropriate in my eyes.
'Japan has a racism problem' isnt the same as 'Japan is racist', right?
My major woah moment was writing things as fact because you watched a documentary. Documentaries are great to get an idea of something but more personal research is needed to be able to state something as fact.
There's too much talent on the wire in an 8 team league
and CJ makes a good point, it would have surely made me much angrier had 'Japan' been replaced with 'India'. Yes, India has a caste/ race/ harassment problem. India, however, is not racist.
And rightly so. She would be the first in line to be pissed off and making corrections if I said "America is racist" because she'd talk about how it is "not everyone!"
I've never been to Japan, and I would agree that saying "It's a fact" because of a documentary is problematic. Plenty of messed up docs, "Waiting for Superman", "Super Size Me", and "King of Kong" to name a few. Coming from someone who LOVES a well done documentary.
Exactly.
I mean, a lot of them don't. How often do we see someone on either side of the aisle get raked over the coals for a particular phrasing of a statement instead of what their overall point was they were trying to discuss?
While I would say that more often affects Republicans than Democrats, it is something that makes the media as a whole spin round and round.
Deleted a message because I don't think it added anything to the conversation and may actually muddle the topic at hand.
hehe #chaos
its true outside of politics too - i never had to measure my words before, I have since I joined Wayfair/ started having 1-1s with reports
Not a bad thing, just made me more personally connect
I find it super annoying how much it takes place here.
Here as in  wayfair or here as in <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
Also, here's an interesting discussion topic:
As wayfair
I was hoping your response here would give me something to rake you over the coals for due to your phrasing
:son_i_am_dissapoint:
I hate how they don't know how to use threads
lol
Nice try
they have to @ each other to make a point
Should...should we thread more?
Not us, the political chat
It's dark and scary and there are a lot of bots in those threads
LOL
There's lots of bots out here
We're equal opportunity botters
I enjoy our bots
Aysh pretending to be a bot was the most confusing thing for me
Politics involves a lot of optics. Smart people can be incredibly dumb depending on the measure.
Like I truly believe a piece of why Hilary did not defeat Trump was that the Democrats had a candidate in Bernie Sanders that got people of all walks of life really really excited and engaged. Hilary just didn't excite as many people the same way. So when Bernie was out, a lot of people just went "Meh" and didn't come out to vote for anyone.
Did I think Bernie was the right choice? Personally no. However I acknowledge he got people much more excited than Hillary ever did. Trump's a dick, but man does he get his base rallied behind him.
That was a rough one to handle. True chaos really.
Hey drew
For level 5, I think you should pick up `flame blade`
```Flame Blade
2 evocation
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V S M (Leaf of sumac)
Duration: Up to 10 minutes
Classes: Druid
You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage. The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd.```
It's a drewid spell, and I don't understand why!!!
Druids are pretty elemental based. Think Avatar. So I can even wild shape into an elemental to make attacks at lvl 10. Hence a fiery blade is just as much in my wheelhouse as making a bonfire to burn people.
Yea, but why is it class locked to Drewids?!?! IT SOUNDS LIKE SUCH A FUN SPELL
Also I forgot my headphones today so productivity is near 0
hahaha 'Drew'ids
He's our only drewid too, so it works great
Opening shots of a war
Here first on distracted CJ News
...WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS
There was a discussion a while back from a dude who was communist. it was interesting
I am... concerned around people's lack of understanding how things work.
I am... concerned around people's lack of understanding how things work.
whats a monopsony?

:til:
................why is politics debating religion? someone fill me in
Same reason the church is tax exempt
oh i mean in the channel!
yup, because religeon and politics are tightly bound
let me go read where the conversation began
oooh now theyre talking about indian politics, which i know zilch about
i appreciate it Brenden
I also appreciate it
Stray bullet territory for sure. Shooting a gas station isn't going to cause an explosion though like the movies or video games.
The idiot providing moral support is...well an idiot
lol
somebody called her out :lol:
tbh i dont think she was being mocking :stuck_out_tongue:
i think they were just saying 'thoughts and prayers' means nothing when you have the ability to do more
and then she randomly had to say 'religion has been painful' for her and :confusion: happened
```I think the thoughts and prayers tweets make it feel like that’s all they’re doing and they’re not going out and trying to change something
[4:02 PM]
Which isn’t enough```

I was more bugged by the first statement
because?
of the assumption?
because of the implication :neutralblob:
hmmm yeah, i can see that!
that was not a serious comment
it was a terrible reference
o:oh:
Well not recognizing it as a reference actually did describe pretty well what I was having trouble describing
Basically seems to imply that people who cant/dont donate are in the wrong
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yUafzOXHPE> ?
whoa this is LOADED
Which is why it's a terrible reference but it totally made it into lexicon
:smile:
I actually am on her side on this one. She's again bring a total twit in how she phrases things. However, gun tragedies happen, politicians come out and say "Thoughts and prayers" and then don't actually make any changes to prevent these things from occurring. Usually ones who get support from the NRA. 
These are people who could do something about the situation and instead give a nice platitude, whether they are actually religious or not.

Good
We maybe fell down on the planning a bit, but the food was really tasty.
*A wild Doug Appears*
We manged to discover drew's new favorite food
Good morning me!
Good morning you!
whats the new fav food?
Tripe
isnt that stomach or something? interesting
14 plates of tripe
wow :smile:
yeah, the 15 plates of tripe was a lot
well, he ordered 15, the waiter brought extra, so he probably at like 18 plates worth
just one person? WOW!!!!
He's a monster
An animal
how many stomachs can one stomach fit. he needs to get into competitive eating
Both sheep and cows have 4 stomachs. How many does Drew have?
After that tripe yesterday, at least 6 new ones
soccer is the buffalo bills of sports?
:sega-s::sega-e::sega-g::sega-a:
Also WTF is Jfet?
CJ I can still hear that line like its 1995
I still like the fact that you only remember it because they had too much space, and added it for fun
The sega intro tune was added because they had extra memory?

Its rare to hear games of that time having extra space. You usually hear the stories of them running out of space. Its why Silent Hill has fog, or why Metal Gear was a stealth game.
So I just discovered the online functionality of the race for the galaxy phone app
We can take out turns at our leisure
Any interest?
How much is the app
I don't recall; I think it was steep
like $5 or $6
Personally, I've gotten more than $5 worth of playtime out of it
giphy now works in thread
<@UDC4QL95G>
I like how a 5 dollar purchase is steep
and we all agree with it, but we would spend way more on the actual board game
BOOM FOUND IT BITCHES!
money
dough
cash
on
lol
Would you like your success to be deleted?
don't care
but you should buy the app
so we can get a game or two going
6.99
you liar!
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
:taste-of-a-liar:
:patrick-lick:
someone should combine those two gifs
Some glitchiness but other than it looks decent
is 3 player worth it? Cause it sounds like it'll just be the 3 of us
I like 2 player games best
but 3 works too
4 is max
I'll pick it up as well

Can u do multiple games? 
yep
did you switch to D&amp;D here?
4 player max though

I'm into multiple 2 player games too

This place is evil for the uninitiated
man we hit all of them, I am understanding why Rich is confused now
Silence Chaos Seed
We have had time to adjust this place of crazy we made
4 weeks to make a choice. seems awfully restrictive
?
we're playing race for the galaxy on our phones
and for each turn, you have 4 weeks to take it or you forfeit
perils of play-by-post
:smile:
at least we don't need a steamboat to carry our instruction to move a bishop anymore
PNKHZHDD &lt;- race
are you helix?
yes
now I need to remember how this game works again
the 2 player version is different from 3-4 player
so remember what game you're in
I might only have played the 3-4 player version before
2 player allows you to select 2 phase cards
otherwise it's the same
ah
That confused the shit out of me at the start
I'm now in a 2,3,4 player game
Dakota you're holding us up!
I HAVE A MONTH TO PLAY HOLD YOUR HORSES
wait, how the hell did you get a 3 cost military world with 1 military?
Oh did you play the 2 cost research "remove this from your empire" card?
ummmm you're on crack
Look at <@UETS9HTSS> board. He has a 3 military cost world and only 1  military
Ohhh I think the turn hasn't ended
it was from the first tirn
Clearly I'm hacking

Good morning, everybody!

SUCCESS!
Back in school, whenever a teacher entered the classroom, we would all stand up and wish them 'Good morning, Ms.LastName'
Then, they would wish us back and say 'sit down' and we would sit down.
I had a few teachers who enforced we aren't allowed to sit without permission or leave at the end of class without them dismissing us.
ohhh. it was the norm for us so it didnt stand out
Leave with dismissal makes at least some sense. why block people sitting?
Power doug
POWER!!!!
mm
OMG if the Principal walked by, there would be a wash of silence so palpable.
Also, since I went to a private school with a uniform we had to ask permission to remove our blazers in class and some teachers never said we could. And they were balls hot
my Catholic school had a dress code, not a uniform. at least until I was a senior, then they switched to a uniform, but knew they could not force the seniors to switch, so I narrowly avoided it
no wonder- i went to a private school too -which is sort of the norm if you can afford it there.
We also had to wear super warm clothes in blistering heat.
our dress code went into how you were allowed to wear your hair. Ive had several pairs of earrings confiscated for being too dangly.
I really can't form an image of you behaving
I kept getting warnings for forgetting to shave
Same and rules on if you could wear make up and the type you could wear
our lesson on reproduction in biology ended with the teacher leading a joint prayer that we would all be virgin until we wedded :smile: :smile: :smile:
Oh I was such a rules follower in school, or at least not blatantly being disruptive by me not following specific rules
even my catholic school didn't do that. although the the state of Michigan did mandate abstinence only education, so the church didn't even need to
Southern Bell Rule follower.... Are you going to tell me you're also an alien, that feels more believable right now
I went to a protestant school :shrug:
:facepalm:
PUBLIC SCHOOLING HERE!
Which state?
In a "Highly Diverse School District"
RI
I should have been a wizard
in :dnd:
RI had like the very best and very worst schools, right?
Wait, I’m thinking Connecticut 
:area51raid:
the north east in general has good and bad districts
I mean it's never been proven that I'm human. But that is what I've always been told
Who was your fav teacher in school and why?
Physics Teacher, Trippy Hippie is hilarious
huh
My favorite Teacher in HS was my physics teacher.  He was a hippie so he had all sorts of fun stories about just weird shit for us
example?
Back country hiking, in a tiny little car to minimize impact on the enviroment
*snort*
You asked
4th grade teacher. Brought in a machete to chop coconuts once. Was big on teaching reasoning over concrete facts. 

Or a professor I had in college. Took classes on Nazism and the evolution of bureaucracy from him. Tiny pugnacious hilarious Jewish fellow. 
That class sounds awesome Doug
Oh, sorry , that’s two classes. The two ideas where not linked. 
I did mean the College class, a crazy Jew talking about Nazism just sounds like a fun class
you dont need a machete to crack coconuts. tut TUT
Clearly you don't know how to impress 4th graders Aysh
How about you Aysh, favorite teacher?
I had a bunch. private girls school meant we were quite close with out teachers. A lot of  them were quite good at/ passionate about the subjects they taught and that helped too.


The Math teacher who would kick me out of class pretty much every week for giggling too much, and the Chem teacher who argues with her saying 'I love teaching Ayshwarya's class, she is so cheerful all the time'

The Chemistry teacher who basically declared my clique as her favorite students ever.

The sub who taught English lit and was a huge fan of Harry Potter.
I miss school- yes I know, that makes me sound like I peaked in high school but I had a really good  time. And I didnt have bills. My dad had bills, but he hid them from me.
My Chem teacher was my Hockey Coach, his Straight A captain could have gotten a way with murder in his class
lol
Senior year was fun, lots of freedom, almost no responsibility
It was certainly easier when you we’re just surrounded by people of the same age, basically impossible not to develop friends. All that social stuff has no system after leaving school. 
OMG the music teacher, who taught us this song where parents are asking their child why they seem to hate them and made the entire class sob.
And a Farewell song written specifically for our school that would be performed by the choir at end of year for the girls who were graduating.
Do you know the song Cats in the cradle? That’s what your description reminds me of. 
Orchestra conductor; I used to just go for music 'lessons' and hang out in his office when I didn't feel like being in class
He was a crazy guy too
I think that's a requirement for music
Must be crazy
What instrument did you play in orchestra? I was a cellist. 
that song sounds like a reverse of what i described :smile:
It’s a classic tearjerker. 
I was also a cellist!
Nice!
they tried to get me to play the bagpipe because i was chubby and apparently that made me a good candidate. I passed.
lol
Oof. 
smart move :thumbsup:
though I wish I knew how to play the bagpipes
It is one of the more melodic weapons of battle. 
I watched someone pull the pipe off the bag, shake out the spit that collected in it while she played, and had it over to someone else.
Ugh. So many instruments have to manage spit. It’s awful. So glad I only had to deal with strings. Dry dry strings. 
I had to use a spit cup for trombone, definitely not gross
no, random blerghs
but we are your friends Doug :cry:
It's a trick doug, don't listen to the Siren's Song
not saying you're not. :stuck_out_tongue:
Siren's bagpipes
Oh yeah heads up doug, Cj pinging people in the morning is NOT automated in any way. You won't receive a direct ping unless cj decides to be mean. You are also not part of the "Summon the Silent" bot, so it would be extremely rare for you to get a random ping in this channel
I've updated the time in the morning my do not disturb goes until
:open_mouth:
sooo :50-50:
: D
yeah, it will happen or it wont
Until the ping wars start again
luckily the do not disturb can be set seperately for work and this
You just said you have DND enabled, i think that means :its-free-real-estate:
? Did I just trip over a conversational landmine?
If it is, Aysh is the catalyst we torture each other at all hours here
wait- why is it me?
not complaining, us taskign why
I'm lost
punctuation CJ
I'm also lost
I believe he meant to say:
`If you did, Aysh is the catalyst. We torture each other at all hours here.`
Those words
Has nothing to do with <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> and everything to do with Aysh
I'm gonna dub Aysh the Chaos Goddess, because I never have any idea what she's up to
This morning, I caught a fruit fly.
I impressed myself.
With what?
chopsticks
bare hands.
Telekinesis
grab or clap?
Indians eat with out hands so its the same for me
grab!
:notbad:
hmm
:kys: didn't get :hr: here?
that's interesting functionality
:kms: or :kys:  get added at all
An emoji must be deleted before it can be aliased
and there are no emoji deletions here
:sillypepe:
had to go look it up, not surprised that particular emoji is *not* in WF emotes
unfortunatley there has been no further discussion of the screenshot
hhehee 'unfortunately' for whom? :stuck_out_tongue:
*who
Apologies for the error
I think it is whom. The lack of discussion is the subject, the third party in question is the object of the preposition
I think it is whom. The lack of discussion is the subject, the third party in question is the object of the preposition
i think 'whom' should be used to answer the question 'to who?' googling
my quick reference on this one:
<https://www.grammarly.com/blog/who-vs-whom-its-not-as-complicated-as-you-might-think/>
&gt;Whom should be used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition.
'Whom should be used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition. When in doubt, try this simple trick: If you can replace the word with “he”' or “'she,” use who. If you can replace it with “him” or “her,” use whom. Who should be used to refer to the subject of a sentence.'
yup, youre right. I WAS right
win-win-win
:smile:
note: I *never* say or right whom myself
you know what sucks about having thick beard hair? :start_a_thread:
hair splinters
....no I didnt know that. huh
i would think washing your face would be tough
It doesn't happen often, but my hair is stiff enough to lodge itself in my fingers
Interesting conversation topic
not the beard hair splinters?
When I got the notification from that message, I assumed it was in the beard thread
Beard splinters are much more chaotic than proper grammar.  Chaos inception!
Lazy good morning!
Summon the Silent
my apartment didnt have hot water this morning.
and i havent been getting postal mail for about 2 weeks now.
Ummmmm
That might be a problem Aysh
yup! 2 of my banks emailed me and im like 'huh'?
so im transferring to another apartment in the same building in october- i think the staff messed up and made the change already
but- Apartment issues keep happening to me. I believe I am cursed.
I think.... you might want to not stay in buildings where bad things happen Aysh
i think CJ is correct :stuck_out_tongue:
or wait for things to get bad enough that you can write a good horror novel
I'm only in to help out if we get neat weapons, like proton packs
just remember, at the first sign of trouble we all have to split up
incorrect answer!
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs5FWIUqu20>
CJ is Geico's new guerrilla markerter
Eh???
Geico was ahead of the time
but im in one of those 'luxury apartment' communities and theyre generally on top of things. Im just cursed!
proton packs?
Ghost Busters
unless the thing they are on top of..... is a graveyard!!
you went from apartments to trapping ghosts! how would I even
:smile:
I'm totally with CJ on this one
i live in the same place where Jo lives!
well, now we know Jyo is haunted as well. We should proabbly warn her
Honestly I should be able to put proton packs in any sentence and it should be immediately referable
Like the Force
Deep will scare the ghosts off with his jokes
are you in the same building, or across the street?
i get the reference, just that it didnt make sense to me :confused:
that might be enough distance to save them
there is an emote spam bot?
Yes, but it only triggers on me
Dakota and I occasionally up the game on trolling the other one
I don't want to help you if I have to do that
From your horror appartment
lol- first few ights i got super freaked out by the bedroom door closing by itself
it was the central air creating pressure
Will accept magic or force powers over science
I had some really crazy flickering lights when I moved into my place, landlord had to replace the fixtures
ok- so how common is the name 'Fatima' do you think?
I was experimenting on whether or not I could make a bot add reacji, this wast the result
<http://www.fatimahospital.com/>
Common enough to have a hospital named after it in RI
tsk- fine
but story is
Fatima is a town in Portugal. _Our Lady of Fatima_ is one of the names for Mary, as she supposedly appeared there.
Fatimah is the daughter of the prophet Muhammad
my neighbors in Pittsburgh (Whom I'm visiting this month) live in this apartment where things consistently would go missing and be found in the randomest places
sunglasses from the entryway would be in the laundry hamper,  for example
*insert inappropriate joke here*
............ I dont get it :disappointed:
me neither
You said that things would go missing and show up in the randomest of places.  Think undergarments or sex toys ending up in other peoples rooms
YOU CAN GIPHY IN THREADS NOW TOO!!!
wait, Aysh, what is the rest of the story?
it isnt a fun story anymore :disappointed:
basically i nicknames the ghost Fatima nad for several weeks after we kept seeing that name - car bumper sticker with 'our Lady Fatima'

And a few months later a NEW movie came out where there is a dude who is haunted by a friendly ghost called Fatima
thats all
LOL!
I think it is
You named the ghost Fatima and then a movie ghost Fatima proved it to be true!
it wouldve been better without all the cross talk :@
Better story than that dance where the girl turned out to be dead so the guy realizes he can see other people on days other than Saturday. 

The dancing was cool in the show but that story was crazy. 
:smile: :smile: :smile: :smile: it took me a while to  connect the dots- that was CRINGE
Well Politics is up to shit today
And Brenden got involved
PEAK!
Is there anything this girl isn't?
I feel like every time she makes a point, she has to state how she's _directly involved_
WHOA THIS HAS GOTTEN :spicy:
<@UDC4QL95G> YOU NEED TO GO READ THIS!
yeah, I'm enjoying this
<https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/>
_Sticks and Stones can break my bones, but words will never hurt me_
lol
why are people askign for this to stop?
dont let it stop!!!
That's because this is :hr: territory
And no one really wants to deal with it
they can just shut up instead
I want to post that article
please do , ive had enough arguments with this  girl
Basically saying, "If you're straight you don't get an opinion" is just as bad as "If you're gay you don't get an opinion"
also she can say 'you dont get to tell me what i consider violent' but she gets to tell someone what they should feel comfortable answering?
WTF
IF I CALL YOU A BAD NAME YOU'RE SCARED YOU'RE GONNA DIE!?!?!
its different if its in perason- but in online gaming?
some person who doesnt know where you live making yo mamma jokes is threatening? sheesh
I like the way they go, "When I'm called a slur in a highly threatening environment and suffer bodily harm means all slurs will cause bodily harm."
Wow that went full :dumpster-fire: real quick
no no no no dont let it end noooooooooooo
It's definitely edge into territory that you can argue is not work appropriate
her question asking if someone was straight and saying 'i didnt ask if he was  gay'. THAT .
I think it's really unnerving how this chick is possibly trying to out someone at work. Your sexuality shouldn't be a factor and you shouldn't have to reveal your sexuality to make a point or have an opinion
Too bad I have lunch plans and have to head out
```The elevator I was on 2 days ago shook violently but no one got physically hurt.```
That happened to be on Copley a week or two ago. The doors of the evaluator opened like one tenth of the way. We had to whack one of them. Thought we were going to get stuck. 
this is being used as justification that verbal abuse is also 'violence'
That’s why I don’t follow the politics channel. I’m happier not monitoring the most hyperbolic interactions in the company. 
they diverted the topic :disappointed:
There is so much gold in that channel
that was a fun read
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UDD45P5A9> I'm gonna spam this thread with screenshots
dont cry because its over, "smile because it happened  " Me to Me
Lol it is noon, it might pick up again after lunch
QED
Turns out, deleting a message can trigger deja-vu
Lol thanks for the tip-off cj
that was quite the read
CJ
Drew has come online, there goes his productivity
Was already shot reading that Atlantic piece
Lol now you have all those screenshots to read
Oh. My. God
please elaborate
Honestly just the attacking going on
it was a fun ride
I don't know the people in the thread but reading it certain people come off as what I say is right, what you say is wrong
very much so
I really don't like people like them, to me they are toxic people that I try not to have in my life and I'm happy I no longer work there and therefore don't have to worry about running into them because I'm afraid I would not be kind
Oh the correct opinion thing got me, loved your response
Both of them are in 3D visual art, so I will likely never have any reason to run into them
When I was in merch, there's a large chance I could have
Im in merch! :smile:
:ohno:
I have and continue to be racially discriminated against in my own country and by my own people so I'm sure Ill have plenty if she tries to one-up me.
of course, its not to the extent of 'i have had friends murdered after being called slurs' like she said because honestly, no matter what is :yikes:
Wait, they're trying to say the violence against me is worse than violence against you? This should not be a one upping situation, all violence is bad
but are words violence?
I thought they were trying to say your opinion on what constitutes violence is invalid because you lack the experience of being verbally abused
Are you saying you want to have the conversation here?
<https://games-club-external.slack.com/archives/CDR5ZBTT7/p1565368743393100?thread_ts=1565367137.381200&amp;cid=CDR5ZBTT7>
No it was more of a joke
should have thrown a :sarcasm: at the end
IT HAPPENED!
I don't like this Alexa person more than I don't like Rachel.
Reading that thread was watching a kid hit someone, then start crying about how they were just hit, when no one touched them.
I mean.... that's them
It was just, I could see how they weren't happy with how Brenden's stuff could be taken. That's the problem with text, is you can't read enunciation. However, the jumps Alexa took to immediately saying she was being discounted were just mind boggling
Yup, and I did. Now I have another person to not like who I'll likely never meet.
Oh yeah i forgot about that
I may actually have to respond to that
I was not "trying to mitigate" the fact that "a person hurts"
If it did:
I don't know if I want to re-open this can of worms..
&gt;It's all semantic nonsense
Yes, the argument was purely about the semantics of the word violence and whether that included speech.

&gt;If a person hurts because of something and you try to mitigate it by saying it's not what they really think it is, it's a bullshit move
I agree it would be a bullshit move if the intent was to mitigate the fact that a person hurts. However, I don't think anyone participating had that intention.
NO ONE said that. how dare they :@
and thats unnecessary name calling
LOL!
do people just suck?
Apparently yes
yes
No matter who you are or what you say, someone will hate your guts
fuck it
decided to send that in the thread
ohhhh joy.....
are you stright?
LOL
Wtf?
EXACTLY!
Ummm, if you're not straight, you're by default at least some range of queer. So that could be outing someone
yeah, I'm a little disappointed that this got glossed over earlier today
she overstepped pretty hard today
:hr:
the person who clled us assholes is speaking about unintentionally hurting people
wait <@UETS9HTSS> is that referencing the latest image? If so I might be missing the importance of the distinction
yeah, referencing the latest image
clearly she is not straight
it felt like she was saying his opinion didn't matter because he was straight
then heavily backtracking when people reacted negatively
OH she as in Rachael
This is embarassing, I assumed somebody who SHARES MY NAME was a girl
that sounds unrelated to this thread?
&gt;she overstepped pretty hard today
I thought she was Cody Jacques in the image
Something that I just realized I'm confused about. Is she implying straight people or straight men don't understand violence or violent speech and can't have an opinion? Because anyone of any gender or orientation can be a victim of violence
I believe so. I don't really see any other way to interpret
`because if you are im going to very politely tell you to stop`
There's so much wrong with what she did you can't target all of it in the moment
I REALLY don't like her
I mean the lack of self awareness just shown is astonishing
If you flip the scenario, she would be the first person to go to HR
Oh definitely
And if she somehow does get reported for any of what she's said today at least she'll probably find a way to say she's the victim
What you have to do Aysh, is identify and ignore them
That's all she'll ever be in her own head, I have no use or tolerance for people like that
Same
I kinda want to email hr...
hmmm
I'm not opposed to it's crazy what people will put in recordable media
eh i wouldn't want <@UETS9HTSS> to get any sort of backlash for participting in the discussion
Do you think I said something worthy of backlash?
I'm curious
Not at all, but I feel like the people who did would CERTAINLY try to play it off that way
hopefully HR would see through that kind of bull
He wasn't even in the start of that fight
ooh they have an anonymous option
THAT'S THE BEST PART
Thing is nothing will be done because she's taking the Minority side of it
idunno, I think she overstepped this time
I mean you can go for, I think you'd have better odds if you could get Cody on board personally as that person is the real victim
`if that concept confusses you`
_damn_
Yea.... You know for people who should be trying to generate sympathy they're doing a great job of making me not care about their plight
This is how I feel with all the hate in that thread
&gt;if that concept confuses you
it's important to note that the emoji is `:confused_cat_at_dinner:`
That's the part that concerns me, is that even though I share some their views, I don't want to help them
Oh that is important
damn it was way funnier without that
(i didn't notice, I was not intentionally leaving out pertinent context for once)
I get that's the emoji, but `if that concept confuses you` is still degratory
this is coming from the guy that said if you disagree you're an asshole
so yes, I get that connotation
You can still give the analogy without calling someone stupid.  Trust me, that's something I've had to learn is how to not come across condescending
Oh god somebody please respond with "are you straight Den?"
:notme:
Nope
I'm not crossing that line even for laugths
I'd love to make a :straight-cody: emoji though
Oh it would be so funny
Ohhhhhh, that's good
to be clear, I'd never create that in a work slack instance
but boy I wish I could
Cause you're a smart boy
I so wanna make a racist and or sexist joke now
bad idea
I know......
if you want to troll people, just support trump
I hate myself for saying that
Well i meant here
oh
then go for it
Other than watching politics I'm done with them
I appreciate humor of all grades of terribleness
I was gonna say in response to you being smart, it must be the straight/white in you showing through
nah, that wasn't funny
LOL!
just came across as white supremacist
Which is why I stopped myself
I'm just shocked that a conversation that started around video game culture ended in "If you're straight your opinion doesn't matter.  Why is everyone arguing with me?"
for the record, i dont think you said anythign that could be misconstrued Brenden
lol
Heh worth it
What?
When we were in the cvs, Dakota showed mei that you could buy batteries on Amazon for cheap show she wouldn't let me buy one
Yeah I don't think you said anything wrong either, although I recognize I'm predisposed to be on your side because you're my friend and I know how you are in person, so I can read that in your voice.
And <@UDDE5960N>, it is frustrating to read because I think I share a lot of their views on topics, but not in this hostile or condescending way that they are expressing them. Makes me not want to support them at all.
Worse, it makes a lot of the discussion we have about their discussions feel like we're all supporting opinions that are counter to theirs. It's been weird and I've genuinely not been a big fan of how much it comes up into this slack.
Oh I didn't put that together that the box was those batteries from that night.
Totally worth it.
I only look at #nonwork-politics for the entertainment value
I don't have any real interest in the conversation other than people watching
Sometimes I'll chime in if I'm bored though
That was made very apparent on Friday since it was my last day of my current role
Oh ya what group r u moving to again?
Pricing &amp; Profitability Development - Competitive Intelligence - Acquisition Platform
basically web scraping as a service
Ah cool 
Good luck! 
Thanks!
hey <@UDC4QL95G>; remember when you said that when you play skyrim you set your carry capacity to 10,000? I did the same, and now I'm encumbered again
clearly I need to set that limit higher
Holy shit, how many dragons have you killed?
dragons? dwarven stuff takes up most of my carry weight
also, the game stats don't include 'dragons killed'
but the answer is a lot
Ah I forgot about the dwarven stuff, though my point stands that carrying capacity is pointless. Game is more fun without it
Lazy good morning!
Summon the silent
Hey Dakota, how fit for a UI do you think Prometheus is?
Agreed
Also I estimate I'd killed ~30 dragons
I got smithing and enchanting to 100 yesterday
Actually it wouldn't be too difficult
the site I am using to host prometheus is designed to be used to host a website,  am just using its server.
If you go to <https://flame-mine.glitch.me/mega/bigstrongcry>, it is a web page served up by prometheus
Cause I'm almost ready to unleash Brenden on my :dnd: program
But I need a way for him to interact with it
so you could easily create a <https://flame-mine.glitch.me/dnd/index> or something
Hmmmm, we'll see
I ruined my first playthrough with 100 enchanting
100% cost reduction in 2 schools of magic was a tad overpowered
with
yeah, I have exactly 100% reduction in destruction
A WILD DOUG APPEARED!
I think he's going to a meeting
?
I saw doug walk by with a bunch of poeple
:creeper:
DAMN YOU BAN WORD NOW I CAN'T FIX MY SPELLING ERROR!
you do have delete powers
Yes, and he's literally on the other side of the building!
Yea but then I have to type it all out again
And that's just too much effort
there's this amazing feature called copy and paste
ACCEPT MY LAZINESS!
<@UDC03KCGK> do you want us to move this kind of drama to a new #nonwork-drama channel?
nooooooooooooooooooooooo
good morninggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
Well i guess the people have spoken
good morning :wave:
Happy Birthday CJ!
Happy bday!
Happy birthday!
You share a birthday with my roommate apparently
yay CJ happy birthday!!!!
Thank you
&gt;Hey, over here on the south side of Boyl10, there is a glass roof at a 45 degree angle that reflects the sun perfectly into the windows. Even with the curtains down, the reflection is painfully bright, is there a place where I can put in a request or something to get thicker curtains put in, or is this a "solve the problem yourself" kinda issue (edited)
That sums up dakota pretty well
I mean i did post that message
Most notably the `or is this a "solve the problem yourself" kinda issue`
Which I feel like with Dakota will have a hilarious result
Well I had my sunglasses on at my desk for a bit
Blackout curtains + tension bar will solve so many problems
lol yeah but I dont wanna have to buy those
Put in a req for them, see if they get delivered
No, me not liking something and me interfering with it are two very different thresholds. I've only tried to step in for the sake of humor or when it became gaslighting instead of chaos
Happy birthday CJ!
Also, wtf, none of us kept tabs that it was his birthday???
what are we talking about here
everyday is his birthday-day because he is born again every day
It's CJ, that sounds more demonic than messiah
Actually according to some people in this channel, that's every second
Why do you think I'm so young looking Drew
Checks out
every second is his birthday second because he is born again every second
The fact I have owner permissions of the slack and have used those on very limited occasions.
I blame <@UK7V13DS7>, she knew it was coming up and told none of us
I forgot that was a show
true, but would we have done anything different? we celebrate his existence every day anyway
You don't know how this works do you?
^_^ it's better this way hahaha
I wouldn't say I *celebrate* it, but I do acknowledge it
False
There's no crazy happy birthday bot to torture me?
Exactly!
BUT YOU SHOULD CELEBRATE IT!
Birthday emojis in every post!
That was great
nice!
The easy, my brothers birthday is the 7th
I'm on it
You never told us! And apparently <@UDC4QL95G> didn't want to use basic SQL
Are you referring to me?
Cause i was just face palming Aysh setting a reminder
I don't have a tendency to tell anyone about my birthday
yes you
Which reminds me, I had a supcisious meeting put on my calendar for today.  I thought it was going to be poaching related but now I feel like it's birthday related
JUST REMEMBER I CAN REUSE WHATEVER YOU GIVE ME!
Hell even Victoria and I have terminated employee records that can be pulled for birthdates.
That's just slightly disconcerting. For birthdays, fine, but what other information can just be pulled?
LET'S FIND OUT!
I can find out your userid for wayfair
That's really about it that's interesting
Still, birthdays is something
Drew is 10/6/2000 that just feels wrong to type
What?
Clearly they just give the day and not the year. I work at a bar, I'm not 18
TRUE
Nor did I start at Wayfair as a 16 year old
Y'all would have noticed
I need more info about Victoria to creep on her
Like her last name? How many are there with that name at Wayfair?
my top 20 ends at 20 and I only got to F for last names
... So your top 100
That just gives me back 100 victorias drew
not useful
Does anyone remember when we had her going away party?
Was that 2019 or 2018?
You can't scroll 100 records to the K's?
Ohhhh
Her last name is K?
That's just slightly disconcerting. For birthdays, fine, but what other information can just be pulled?
Kripinski
LET'S FIND OUT!
You can't scroll 100 records to the K's?
Was that 2019 or 2018?
11/8
Ohhhh
Her last name is K?
Kripinski
How old do they say she is, 20?
yea everyone is 2000
I can find out your userid for wayfair
That's really about it that's interesting
That's for the best. At least some minor data masking
Still, birthdays is something
Also according to Wayfair, I'm older than Victoria
You're all so young you look the same to me
Drew is 10/6/2000 that just feels wrong to type
What?
Clearly they just give the day and not the year. I work at a bar, I'm not 18
alright I have no idea if this will work
cj say something
TRUE
Nor did I start at Wayfair as a 16 year old
Y'all would have noticed
I need more info about Victoria to creep on her
Found out where Dakota went
<@UDDE5960N> when is Dakota's birthday?
Like her last name? How many are there with that name at Wayfair?
That's already happened
I made a bot that wished him happy birthday every time he typed
God this is going to be obnoxious
it already is
Was that 2019 or 2018?
You can't scroll 100 records to the K's?
Umm, what happened to Deja Vu? It isn't reacting anymore
it can react to delete events
or something like that
yeah the original message gets the reaction, but is deleted
wait cj say another thing, the bot was only half done
That's concerning to hear you say
:perfect:
You're gonna make people's eye's bleed with this
Amazing
hmmm not sure why it doubled
oh because of the banned word lol
Probably
Um what the heck happened to make chaos monkey an emoji overload!?
Its only CJ cuz it's his birthday
Save me......
lol this has gotta be awful on mobile
it's CJ's birthday
hence this awful bit of code
I think you should append more emojis the more CJ posts in a row
23 is max
I would need more users
HA ASS
which i _could_ do, but it's not worth the effort
I'm surprise you went with the same ones each time and didn't make it random
I wanted party parrots
also its a little funky cuz I had to allow the bot to be reacted to, which wasn't normally possible
alright reactons are done
yeah this probably is killing the phones
Thank god
Thank god
Nope... that's worse
rofl
not sure why it is trippled
WHY THE FUCK DOES IT HAVE DIFFERENT SPELLINGS?!?!?
I was literally typing it
Even better
and decided censoring a letter was funnier
caught you in the process
wait, was that a dejavu?
You'll never know now!
was this bot supposed to annoy CJ or everyone?
both?
dont tell dakota your birthday
:stuck_out_tongue:
I came back from lunch to see  100 notifications from slack
That's not an uncommon occurrence here
unfortunately deleting the message does not delete the bot
Alright the cj bot is back to the original implementation
Thank god
Orrrr.... not
Original as in no reactions or extra text
:party::cj::confetti_ball: is staying
Unless somebody else turns it off
Really you put it in the pretend to be a both section? I'm so gonna build out a birthday function just for you
I went for quick and easy
that was the easiest way I found
I like the fact that no one has responded to your request yet Dakota
yeah :sadpanda:
????
that was my idea
Wishlists are not chaotic!
but are they monkey?
Doug asking the real questions here
Having come back to my phone after 1.5 hours I can say, that was not fun for mobile and way too many messages
And CJ why are you trying to creep on me?
I think he was trying to find your birthdy in wayfair database
Ahh, could have just asked
Nah that's too easy
I WAS SUCCESSFUL!
<https://games-club-external.slack.com/archives/CDR5ZBTT7/p1565629117478500>
Or you found the date they have, but is not actually my birthday
Turns out all you post wayfair people still have your birthdays in the DB, though it sets everybody's age to 19
Pretty sure the only change is Active and term date
Hey you're a week before Mei!
I mean if my birthday was in November, it would explain why November is the best month
Mehhhhhh
Silence Chaos Seed
It's not going to ping the thread twice
Only summon the silent can
I mean he could trigger the *_FUCK YOU_* Chaos Seed
It would probably amuse me greatly if he did
I don't remember this at all....
oh yeah i always forget that one exists
We've never triggered it yet, also we don't silence chaos seed that often
looks like its a 2% chance, and I don't think it has ever happened naturally

:laughing:
Neither can we half the time
Today, I chose to remove Do not disturb on my  phone since I thought (i barely get calls during the day anyway).
Today , I had a meeting with my director.
Today, this slack has been more active than usual.
Lol i we have been posting in large bursts today
I feel you Aysh, the amout of times i've had to put my phone in the pocket because of this slack is non-trivial
My phone doesn't seem to get notifications while I have the desktop app up
Today my phone is just muted entirely
Mine switches over after a certain period of time
I think it's like 15?
I had to turn my phone to silent in a meeting today
Alright, cj you are back to mostly normal
no more double notifications
THANK GOD!
Wait... what does mostly mean?
mostly
Ohhh god, I have normal odds now
Ohhh that looks bad
you can say that again
lol
ah darn only works for posts that use the SlackEvent class
???
you can say that again
......
See now it only adds them to your impersonations!
This is true
no extra messages
Just the normal amount of chaos
Eh marginally more due to likely bugs, but yeah
multiple emote imports in a single day?
Emoji Enthusiests is being quite friendly today
I am also confused
but we got :butters-joy: now
I ran that one manually, I was gonna make a comparison between last friday in politics, vs emoji today, however I realized without the context of hovering over the emojis, most of the meaning was lost
So can't complain
it should also speed up tomorrows import a tbit
turtle guy is blowing up nonwork-emoji
it's great
god there are so many more since the import even
WTF IS GOING ON WITH TURTLES?!!?1

and now we're here
dude that thing is creepy as fuck
I am extremely perplexed at how much free time everyone at wayfair has :stuck_out_tongue:
Don't be you're not here anymore
Brenden just gave me the best idea _*EVAAAAA*_ I can be a halfing rogue/ranger.  If I go beast master I can hide behind my pet and when discovered ride it into battle
When i want to troll other people, I just hide behind them and do evil shit
RAW when you do the stupid shit, people see you, then you hide afterwards
doing the stupid shit breaks the hide condition
I think for the stupid shit I want to do I have to hide before and adter
even if you do that, they'll still know it was you
Smoke bombs
LOTS of smoke bombs
CJ if you do that your pet is going to die like every fight
so just don't get attached
25 gp for rez!
yup. just sometimes people get weird around fictional animals.
also, this isn't the dnd channel
if that matters
Nope!
A good amount of DND discussion that happens in this channel is still fun out of context
and it adds good banned words and dejaVus
Technically I mostly want to hide behind roland and delta for mischief. Maybe torment Jarem
Riding a bear into battle sounds like too much fun to pass up
Make sure its an exotic saddle
Bears can climb
Yea I figured that one
```That said, if I ever end up in a campaign where two people want to play Small races that dual wield, you can damn well count on me to jump at the chance to play a Goliath Barbarian with Tavern Brawler so I can have the carrying capacity to dual wield those dual wielders. With Proficiency.```
I mean IM OK WITH THIS!
Alright CJ you need to multiclass into a 3rd level rogue
PIck assassin
then every time you hit a surprised enemy, its an auto-crit with the sword of spinny
We will just spend a day with me and drew casting Pass without Trace, and then you run up and auto-crit general mobs until the sword of spinny maxes out
...and that's how you get an item nerfed
:lol:
I do like breaking the balance though
It's quite fun
It’s things like that which make me really enjoy Dungeon World. if you roll badly I get to ask you to make hard choices. So you’ll end up hearing “you can save your teammates, but you’ll lose your sword if you do”. Choices like that are kind of baked in. 
Dungeon world?
probably a different game system
so not D&amp;D
but a similar game in that it's a tabletop RPG
And then it’s funny when you decide you like your loot more than your party. 
I’d let it happen, and afterwards note that the collective bullshit somehow awakened a beholder riding an ancient dragon. 

And if you beat that you get to be king of all bullshit

I'm standing across someone wearing sunglasses. On the orange line. Underground.
<@UDC4QL95G>
<@UDBV9N1E0>
<@UDD45P5A9>
I mean I do that everyday, just not on the orange line normally
<@UJTEHPEPL>
I don't have _that_ many enemies
I mean.... you can if you want
<@UDDE5960N> always
But whyyy
Because clearly a lot extraterrestrial shit goes down on the red line
Or because I wear prescription sunglasses and to switch them when I'm underground just to change them again when I get off the train is just too much effort
That and the aliens
But mostly the aliens, CONVENIENT EXCUSE VICTORIA!!!! :tinfoil_hat:
lol ok that makes sense
I usually just forget to take mine off
how....?
On some trains, the train doesn't get any darker by going underground because the lights are so bright. So maybe forget you're wearing them? Because the brightness is the same?
I mean it's like wearing normal glasses, you just kinda forget you are wearing them
Only reason I would realize I am still wearing them is if they somehow became inconvenient, which is not very likely
Like not being able to see because it's too dark?
<@UDC4QL95G>
Hey man the sun burns
More referring to the fact you're being ignored
Who's ignoring Dakota?
Context: ```Hey, over here on the south side of Boyl10 (S6-S8), there is a glass roof at a 45 degree angle that reflects the sun perfectly into the windows. Even with the curtains down, the reflection is painfully bright, is there a place where I can put in a request or something to get thicker curtains put in, or is this a "solve the problem yourself" kinda issue ```
we have a community experience channel
Where no one is taking his issue seriously
I mean not being able to see your screen is a fantastic reason to not work
Ohh redacted
actually our monitors are perpendicular to the reflection, so it just burns our peripheral vision
not sure if that makes it better or worse
Oh that's def worse, if you can work with one screen just sit in the kitchens and work
yeah I probably will start doing that. It's bright enough so you see spots if you look at it so extended exposer is probably bad for your eyes, even in just the peripheral vision
1. What is there to see? Mostly I just stare into space.
2. It only gets marginally darker
:slack-true:
that's an awful emoji
it was a slack bug from yesterdya i think
<@UDDE5960N> what do I do now, they are STILL ignorming me in the boyl community experience channel
sunglasses
I'm gonna paint the damn window
Actually sticky notes should work
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyjJbhuwGkU>
get colored sticky notes and make pixel art
lol I had the same thought
but without the artistic part
what's your team name?
It's a private channel
not what I meant
what's your team name?
does it have initials you could use?
Oh lol Service Communication Platforms
SCP?
make that in the sticky notes
Actually we have room for approx ~9 characters before we get into territory that isn't ours
You could do sticky note art of curtains
I told you, put in a requisition for blackout curtains and a tension bar.
Or become a mad scientist and destroy other building
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation>
Tjat
Unfortunately none of us are any good with art. Letters are probably our limit
I've been instructed to smack Dakota upside the head next time I see him and he is completely oblivious. Trust me, he would not notice it got significantly darker.
This conjures very different images than blood of your enemies.

I hate it when people do this in help channels
just say HI back
I hate it when people do that via any medium
okay, you've succeeded in distracting me from what I was doing before
now what do you want?
Could you take any longer to finish typing your question?
secure contain protect
Whats worse, just `Hi` or something like "Hi how are you"
just hi
at least I know they don't need something if `how are you` is there
If it is a random person, and they open up with Hi how are you
they want something, but they want you to acknolege their message before they ask their question
well, random, they still probably need something
which is SILLY
it's like: I want verification that you're available before I make my unreasonable request so you can't pretend you didn't see it
it's such bs
or at least, that's how it reads to me
it wastes so much time
&lt;/rant&gt;
When I see somebody is typing in my DM history, I sometimes like to just type "NO" before they are able to finish their message.
The problem is when you are too slow, and it looks like a legit answer
nah, I just type :wave:
Yeah depends on the person who is messaging me
Some people get a :wave: others get :f-this:
I often find myself having been in a store for like 15 minutes before I realize i'm still wearing sunglasses
when I notice, I _do_ take them off, until then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It's work. Skip the formalities and get to the chase of why you want my attention
You want to type some softening statement? Sure, but it better be in the same message as your fucking question
Two banned words?
Your
My
Did it switch?
Maybe I typed your the first time and forgot

Two banned words?
There should only be one

also megamoji's ban command is broken
so nice try
is it?
I
Damn
Yeah, I accidentally broke it when I updated the Reactions to use the Prometheus user
Breaking it there is why the REDACTED bot exists actually
Redacted doesn't redact bots
but that is a good way to reveal the ban
I like Brenden's debugging methods
your ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<@UDC03KCGK> life- life  broke me
if i said I dont actually like board games, would I get kicked off this slack?
Probably
And there's no such thing as not liking board games, you just haven't found the style that fits you best
Also you played a bunch with us
Yes but HOW did life break you? I want gory details!
haha i was kidding. I didnt say i was going to 'admit' that i dont like them
Ive played an 8 hour game of Avalon once
Feels like a hostage situation
no for real- the dude who finally won was doing this long con- we were all at an airport waiting for our respective flights to board and he pretended he was worried about missing it till we missed ALL his cues and then WHAM!
This isn't convincing me you actually like board games. 
Also that you are not a witch
when did i claim otherwise?
But how do you know she is a witch?
No idea what this is referencing
Also burn the heretic doesn't generate any good giphys I tried.
Also burn the heretic doesn't generate any good giphys I tried.
```On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in various disguises```
HARRY POTTER!!!
Also burn the heretic doesn't generate any good giphys I tried.
I did not retain any of that
Witch + fire = *teeheehee*
sounds like witch talk to me

For gizmos, I don't see a strategy that really trumps what I was doing last night.  Buildings into pick, pick into take, converters to build whatever.  Every turn is building (which is making victory points), and setting you up for the turn after
That's not something you can always get. The more people know to look for that kind of thing, the harder it becomes to get it.
So basically you think it's an optimal strategy, however a suboptimal strategy can win because if all the other players a doing it you can't get the resources required for it?
The cards you need might not accually appear to you quick enough for the strategy to become viable
for example, a large number of converters showed up very early, which were mostly ignored by other players. Wihtout converters, you likely would not have been able to get such a good engine
We were also ver light on Tier 3 cards since Brenden got suck with a slow start.
How does brenden's slow start affect either you or drew, both of you were going very heavy research?
You ALSO had all other players with File synergy, which meant by the end of the game, we had a good amount fewer buildings
Heavy research is slow if you choose to file
CJ, I think it’s like drafting, it’s self correcting.  The optimal strategy only exists if other players allow it. More experience would remove the problem. 
Makes sense, I was just curious if my lack or experience had a gap.  To Dakota's point, a file strategy feels slow because it's essentially adding a turn to your win con
It adds a turn to every building you build unless you get it as a free action, which only exist in tier 3 buildings
Buildings seem to be the major source of VP
There is a building that doubles all the VP tokens. Its a fun build-around
why was i not alerted of this thread

hm, google translate is not so great with that one. It says the language is Bangla and it translates to:

which I sort of doubt captures your meaning
I speak Tamil and no, that isnt what I meant- I said I have no idea what you just said (in reality I do though)
ah, well, I guess you were speaking for me, as I had no idea what you had just said.
: P
oh, when I set google translate to tamil manually it actually does a decent job with it:

Im kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm glad
I really like the

personally it sounds soooo fun.  Like you're about to duel with a person who's impersonating someone
_A good UI is like a good joke, if you have to explain it, it isn't good_
<https://userinyerface.com/>
That UI is a great joke
see how long it takes you to get through it
I DON"T LIKE IT ALREADY!
00:03:53

This sucked
I only got to the 2nd page, how did you find a Cyrillic character?
BOOM THREAD HERE BITCHES
The Cyrilic was optional
Ohhhhhh
Gave up on the page after that. The UI is impressive
&gt;The only winning move is not to play
No. The only losing move is to not try

Those guys really like turtles

Yolt: you only live turtles?
your on live, turtle!
You're on living turtles!
nacho nacho mannnnnnnnnnn
if an expression needs subtitles, the acting is being done wrong
YOLO = "you obviously like owls"

hmmmmmm
mmmhmmmm
Aysh report back on the mayhem
You're the <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> spy
NOOOOOOOO im not gonna go stand in line for that no
For science Aysh
Im lactose intolerant today
Really just today?
:smile:
Not really sure what I expected, but it wasn't that
I feel like..... that's not milk given the way it sticks....
Oh that's def a yogurt of some sort
i think its elmer's glue
that seems evil aysh
```1. Glue
Real milk tends to make breakfast cereal soggy and rather unappetizing in pretty short order. You know what doesn’t do that? White glue. Yogurt or shampoo have also been known to do the trick.```
yes, but that's going into his mouth
soooooo, i'm gonna go with it's edible which makes it yogurt
Unless you're a glue eater, were you a glue eater aysh?
i wasnt even familiar with that concept till i saw it in cartoons- why would kids eat glue?
It's the only way the figure out is this food or not
this is clearly abuse of underage workers
???
WHAT ARE YOU PLOTTING AYSH?!?!?
raising awareness about kids suffering in the dairy advertising industry?
Lets just pretend its frosting
or is that still abuse
its glue- as evidenced by the absolute terror on his face
I guess it'd depend on the type of frosting
alright how much would you need to be paid to dump that cup of watered down glue on your face?
With my mouth open and tongue out?
Or just on my face?
hmmmm lets say yes. mouth open tongue out
with or without cameras?
Eh without, but here are witnesses
specifically the people paying you to do it
Yea.... no
Lol if drew walked up to you wand was like 'here dump this on your face and i'll give you 2 grand.'
5k
seems fair
<https://tenor.com/view/austin-powers-dr-evil-mike-meyers-billion-dollars-gif-3468913>
:doubt:
I'd say most people would probably do it on the spot for ~10k, especially if they see the cash
You asked me how much I would do it for
American dollars? Canadian dollars? Zimbabwean dollars?
Not what the average fool would
Cold hard American dollars
10k wouldn't be enough?
Nah, gotta pay taxes on that shit
Walk away with like 5K, and I have to get glue out of my face
Why, somebody handed you cash, why would you report that?
I HAVE NO FAITH IN PEOPLE!
I literally said Drew
The medical for this is like a solid 3K
medical???
Elmers glue is nontoxic
Eyes man
EYES!
you close them
and now they're glued shut
its watered down glue, it doesn't dry that fast
and even if it did, it would be a layer on top of your lids, and easily peeled off
yeah
ALONG WITH YOUR EYELIDS!
And all that hair
have you never made elmers glue gloves?
no restrictions so you can wash up asap
dont give it time to dry
You're on a street Aysh, NO WHERE TO WASH UP!
SUFFER!!!!!
street was an example- street could be the street in front of my apartment
Also, your hands and most of your clothes are clear, just wipe it off
jusmp in the shower immediately- youre set
hell, just use the bottom of your shirt to wipe your whole face
You take too much of faith aysh, this is like making the deal with the devil
You get what you want with a terrible twist
yeah, glue on your face and clothes
this is much easier to handle than like, a color run
its not like its a cup of glitter
UHHHHHHH COLOR RUNS ARE EVIL TOO!!!!!
They don't have the newest spider man in gif yet
I need me some peter tingle!
NOT GOOD ENOUGH I ALREADY SAW THAT!
WTF!!!
the 80s were such a weird time
This channel is only ever active while I’m in meetings. 
So I come in at the weird place the conversation ends, not the reasonable place it started. 
maybe someone's trying to tell you somethign Doug
I also feel that way Doug
Although there is a giant still active thead
which is why brenden really likes chaos seed, it's a way to keep track of what we're up to
and what we are up to is INTEGRAL! \
At the ice cream truck. There is a line, but for free ice cream it’s not so bad. 
pics
eh not the worst
And it’s moving pretty quick. 
that is pretty tolerable
Come get ice cream, clear Wayfair doesn’t want you to work today. 
lol
They probably won't have any I can eat so no interest
ummmmm i'm worried for you
There is a non dairy sorbet
Ohhhhhh
Ignorance really is bliss
I’m almost there. Going to have been on line about 10 minutes. 
Phish food.  
Damn there’s a line?
I think the correct response is "there's only a 10 minute line????"
Free icecream rich
i would like some ice cream about now
soooo go get some?
yup- heading home soonly
You're not going to get the free stuff?
probably that CJ is still spying on me when I go to meetings on his side of the building
free stuff?
ice cream
Dakota it's not even like you're here
Well I knew we were talking about ice cream, i was confused at the termiology change
You posted that ice cream would be free today!
yeah but when I see `stuff` I don't think ice cream
dunno what to tell you doug knew what was going on
too drunk
It’s 5:00
During work beer
lol nah i'm not actually drinking
seemed like a good excuse though
It happened again
Too bad it's a real thing here
They put up banners on my building. 
Oooh is that a fun thing that happens?
First time they’ve done this. But I guess this is a bigger deal than most feast day celebrations? Idk. 
What's a feast day?
I'm aware I can Google it, I just thought I'd ask first.
This whole conversation is making me think we need to get the Million Dollars But... Game
a feast day is set on anniversary of the day a saint dies (such things used to be more common in the medieval era, celebrating birthdays instead is a relatively modern thing)
apparently I was the ban word yesterday
Today's ban word
Think gigantic parties aysh!
oof, they are going to have a display of St Anthony's relics, which in this case means his preserved tongue.
tongue just making it's rounds!
<@UHQD9J1SL>
they flew it in from Italy
<@UDC4QL95G>
<@UDC03KCGK>
<@UETS9HTSS>
<@UDBV9N1E0>
<@UDD45P5A9>
<@UJTEHPEPL>
made a furniture purchase yesterday
<https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/latitude-run-addingrove-bar-with-wine-storage-latt3729.html>
fancy
What are you getting it for?
to replace my glass table of liquor
and free up some cabinet space
Ahhhhhhhh
i
<@UDC4QL95G> you doubted me you ass hole
The ban yesterday was `came`, dunno why it switched early
My expiration date appears to have the wrong timezone if I had to make a guess
Ohhh weird
I'm going to the rmv now. Wish me luck
There is no luck to be had Aysh
Thanks
Only suffering as denoted in Dante's inferno
:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Such a positive outlook
I’ve only been once, and had no trouble. 
I think you confused positive with realistic :wink:
I also have a great copy of the Divine Comedy is anyone wants to read it. 
I missed my stop. Good start!
#winning!
Hmm now that I think about it, not redacting people who haven't opted into chaos doesn't really do anything, since their messages are the ones that they are not going to be trying to read
Which is why it's extra funny!
I
THE GODS HAVE BEEN ANGERED!
is the word I
You're using a funny i aren't you
i
I
nope
Welp, it borked again
:bug:
<@UDC4QL95G>
Nah I changed the ban to experiment with the expiration date
I noticed
I TOO HAVE THE FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE!
I was getting Midnight GMT, it should be fine now probably
I hate timezones
lol
They are the bain of programing
They are the bane of programing
I only saw CJ's comment on my notifications and just assumed he was talking about timezones.
lol
thinking of timezones, I have a meeting from 8am to 11am tomorrow with Berlin
boooooo
WFH day???
yup
IM doneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
WOOOOOOOOOOO
hello!
:donezo_stars:
hahahaha time zones. Daylight savings. Why is that even a thing? Does using a 24 hour clock make you cool? Isn't is funny you can board an airplane today and land yesterday?
Wrong side of the world Aysh, we board planes and land tomorrow
Depends which direction you travel CJ 
No..... East brings you forward, west, brings you backwards till you hit the international date line and then go into tomorrow
So unless you're flying out between like midnight and 6am going west
WE ONLY GO FORWARD FROM HERE BABY!
I keep meaning to do a true circumnavigation, but then I might be permanently out of phase. 
They are still making more turtle emojis
It’s turtles all the way down. 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down>
I was going more with why we keep making turtle emoji's but that is a neat piece of info doug
IT 2
:you_must_construct_additional_pylons:
its all connected. The emoji has become one with the true nature of the cosmos
ugh, damn underscores
lol
don't like _? Why???
they require an extra key being pressed down
whereas - doesn't
_.js is so old hat. ES6 has the array functions you need natively now
:confused-dr-who:
Forever dealing with future doug, never today's doug
Or would you be yesterday's doug???
depends on the direction
I'm so lost
I think East to West is supposed to be easier on jet lag, so I think that'd push me backwards a day
Wikipedia is smarter than we are
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line>
&gt;A person who goes around the world from east to west (the same direction as Magellan's voyage) would gain or set their clock back one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and would gain 24 hours for one circuit of the globe from east to west if they did not compensate by setting their clock forward one day when they crossed the IDL. Conversely, a west-to-east circumnavigation of the globe loses an hour for every 15° of longitude crossed but gains back a day when crossing the IDL. The IDL must therefore be observed in conjunction with the Earth's time zones: on crossing it in either direction, the calendar date is adjusted by one day.
Soooooo, if you go east to west, you go backwards, then forwards, then backwards
`the International Date Line (IDL) is an imaginary line of demarcation`

^first line of the article, admits the international date line is imaginary! fictional!
how can it protect us from time distortions if it doesn't exist!
I bet CJ clicked the national cookie day link
`from: fun`
WHERE IS THIS COOKIE THING?!?!?!
open your email
Its phishing
Ohhhhh
maybe chec kyour spam folder
that's pretty convincing expect for
this was a bit of a giveaway though
Yea......
Also we don't send things from fun
I just assumed it was from Frank Un
Look how good we are with doing phishing guys!
the link goes to `<http://capturedata.acxx53.de|capturedata.acxx53.de>` lol
lol
magic doug
Magic
Magic = not real, Time Paradox = real
till i get a flux capacitor I don't care
wait, we should have non wayfair people click on our internal phishing link
that'll totally fuck with their heads!
I'm pretty sure the links have unique identifiers
:disappoint:
That makes me sad now
I really like brenden's idea
you could give out your link, then security will ask how you were gullible to click the same spam link 20 times
Short term memory loss
'I wanted 20 cookies'
Wait... doesn't wayfair stock Melano and Oreos?
Minecraft
there are cookies with m&amp;m in our kitchen
but all those pale in comparison with fresh cookies.
Woh never seen those here before
whaaaaaaaaaaaaat what cookies are those?
I know I saw them yesterday. Can’t find them today. 
there are alos chips ahoy minis. but i dont like them, i like my cookies chewy
Chewy cookies &gt; crispy cookies
Fight me
Depends on the cookie
In general I'd agree
but Chips Ahoy soft cookies are gross
bad cookies are bad.

Does anyone have Vision insurance through Wayfair?
I do
:hand:
Wow, now I need to start watching this show
How much is it per paycheck or monthly?
I believe I do? I should probably use that.
No idea TBH
I haven't looked since I signed up
Is it possible to look briefly?
:thinking_face:
$2.28
 biweekly
Well fuck me
so yeah, I guess I should see an eye doctor or I've just wasted that
Bob's burgers is great.
Looking at plans not through a workplace and it is $33.25 (admittedly for Sam AND me, but that's still $16.13 per person)
actually this song is a callback to a song in part 1 called "Nice things are nice"
it's bundled
I think a lot of the cost is part of the regular health insurance
classified as a 'buy-up'
If you need to pick one episode to see if you like it, start with "_Bob Day afternoon_"
Fair enough, might be able to get health insurance and tack this on
that's weird though, its a different company than the health insurance
Yeah I just assumed it was a negotiated rate because of Wayfair's size
and thus getting people like Doug who forget to use it
to be fair, this is the first year I've bought it
I get in case I ever need it, like regular insurance
The cookies I "make" are like half cooked blobs of dough
It bothers mei
BUT IT SO DELICIOUS WARM!
maybe cook them more?
I don't get how this works
ISN'T THIS HOW IT ALWAYS WORKS?!?!?!
&gt;Target creature you control fights target creature you don't control.

Read the card
yea... but isn't that what generally happens
Me: GO MURDERING GOOD MONSTER!
You: FIGHT BACK MY CREATURE!
nope. This lets them fight without attacking. normally the defender gets to choose not to block
MTG is not Yu-Gi-Oh

that kid kinda looks like you CJ
Why do I want to do that?
That's all I need to know about MTG
Well we share the same idea
Arena is free
and Magic is the best game
SO MUCH MEMORIZATION
not really. they keep the number of keywords pretty light.

Honestly, its easier to follow that Race for the galaxy (in paper, the app has good reminder text)
THE APP IS SO MUCH BETTER
I have some sample decks, I can teach you some time
I've read some reddit on it, Do you want the starter decks i've picked from from numerous PAX?
All I remember is watching 2 elves decks go at it is boring because no one can do the math in their head to figure out who wins
right, I built more exciting starter decks than that.
Delirium vs invention
I mean if you want to teach I'll sit down and listen some day
but I can't say that I'm looking for another time suck
yes, schedule something and I will teach. offer open to anyone.

<@UHQD9J1SL> I actually have played a couple games with Jyo
what is a deck
particular pile o'cards
isnt that the thing on ships where you can walk
what is an o'card?
edited
also yes to the ship.
I can't tell if she's serious or messing with you
its also a way of punching someone
what is an 'edited' and why are you calling me that? is that how you spell 'idiot' in new england?
Lol
He's not from new england
Only I am
oh so is he from the older england?
'idiot' comes unchanged from the 14 century, so I guess that's also how you spell it in old england
from greek, basically meaning "private person", implying a person uninterested or unlearned in public affairs
i like how you refer to yourself in the 3rd person Doug. Its very sophisticated. also, kudos for staying the same over 700 years.
I am endless
are you, then, beginninfull?
overflowing with everchanging possibility
but the probability will have to be at most 1
probably is *exactly* 1. I am.
but were you?
yes.
and I shall be
how do you 'be'? do you bzzzzzz and flail your arms?
i do not understand your culture.
Yogurt is quite simple
except if it is glue.
agreed

OTHER'S NEED TO SUFFER!!!
ok, well, CJ killed that last thread with his distractions, the point was I'd totally teach people MtG if they wanted. If you have a windows machine, their free-to-play client is actually quite nice.
thats mean. Why do you hate Others so much?
whats a windows machine? that thing you used to roll down your car windows?
yes
oh, Joy. I have 4.
manual or automatic?
manual powered.
wow that sucks
Because I'm evil aysh
i have to pick a button and push it
4 windows is so many. what luxury.
........no I am evil aysh. Youre CJ
how many is so many?
silly me. you just said Four
really any amount. I don't own any windows with buttons
That thread melted part of my brain
Aysh likes to break every so often
Too bad she has another full day of work to get through
Very on point
hm, I'll have to keep an eye out to see if she ever breaks. I've don't think I've seen it yet.
<@UDDE5960N> Discard two cards
Drew's brain melted not mine! He should discard!
This weekend is more daunting for me than you'd think. I have six hours of dancing, four of which are auditions.
Why are you auditioning!?!?!
I will admit that is more dancing than I will do this weekend. 
That's more dance than I'll do this month
Just finished an MtG draft at work. Decked people out with snow, never tried to kill them. Great fun.

good morning!!!!
I rolled out of bed and right into a meeting today
That is definitely not how I like to start my day
I..... concerns
obviously aquaman is the lord of the air and sky
my PM and I both had a meeting from our respective beds last morning :smile:
he is fly-fishing
ba-dum-ching
that ching sounds off, do a ba-dum-tiss
while I agree, there is something to say about using the canonical onomatopoeia.
Access denied? :panic2:
what is that something?
'nyat'?
Mostly referring to your permissions issues at the beginning of the week
That probably lasted till yesterday

Aysh speaks in internet troll
Probably resolved at 9pm last night
Need to check this morning
Silence Chaos Seed
no i actually mean  it :smile: its pronounces 'loll' like 'lull' with an o
oh, I know what you meant
: P
I had no idea and thought she was trolling
i wasnt
i have become the girl who cried Wolfenstein
it also means if you legit don't know what I'm talking about I'll never know.
I"M SO CONFUSED!
but are you? or are you trolling?
WOOT WOOT!
im not
my Latin teacher in catholic school forbid wikipedia as a source because she thought it was wikan, and thus witchcraft
:eyetwitch:
you mock me
The robot or me?
it is mocking me by mocking me
I mean I had teachers tell me harry potter was actual witchcraft and by reading it you could learn actual magic

Too bad they were just wrong, would have been cool to learn spells
What doesn't mock you is a better question?
the curse of the little sister is to forever be mocked :cry:
lol
oh the joys of being the eldest child
they tried to ban HP for a very brief period in my school. We laughed at them in magic.
Everything is mine, and I'm just lending it to you
Question for the engineers (in thread)
The twilight series was locked behind a case and until you were 18, you had to get a parent to sign off to allow you to check it out
well, there is some sense there.
So I have the PC class that handles most of the PC stuff.  And then I built a instance class in order to handle combat
I was planning on having the instance class pass functions to a list and the PC class would run the functions before making a roll to determine mods.
But this doesn't handle positional arguments very well, like when I'm using a ranged weapon too close or too far
I could force the Combat class to just remove and repass functions to PC
do you want to set up some time for an architecture review? it'll be easier to help on a whiteboard than over slack
If you want sure
Creepy
CJ, you misspelled catholic
catholic v. Catholic
let's fine some time to get Dakota in on this as well
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2teYFZt5Tw>
sigh, gonna be a fun morning
Yeah that could be fun
:party-explosion:
I can’t believe we still use moxie. 
Those jobs are what enables us to push a good deal of volume away from them
All of service is planned to be moved out of moxie in Q1
I am not up to date on the events besides the images of massive protests. What are the two sides here?
China is going to murder everyone, people being murdered
That's the 2 sides here
Sure, but that doesn't seem like a reason why somebody at wayfair would threaten another person at wayfair for having the discussion
We have a lot of Chinese nationals, it's more that Wayfair is afraid the screws that China will put on it, rather than explicit threats of violence
note
&gt;There has been reports to HR that this event is offensive and humiliating to certain people.
Yeah, that's what I don't understand
The internet is full of "China is evil, free hong-kong" but that can't be the whole store
No, that's really the whole story dakota
It’s really not. 
Come on
This is classic dictoratorship crushing the rights of people
I'm like 90% sure it is not, otherwise there it would be the concentration camp issue all over again
Outrage is directed at certain things
These people get outraged over concentration camps, not asian dictators
They can do _something_ about the camps, we can do _nothing_ about Hong Kong
Snow?
I would probably even argue they can draw parrallels to their family that they'll struggle to draw for Hong Kong
At the heart of the HK the issue is even though HK is part of China again since 1997, they are still supposed to have a level of independence and control of their own legislature and politics for (I believe) a few more decades, but China doesn't seem to care anymore and want them full under China control now
50 years from 97 is..... 47, so 38?
But what about the issue is `offensive and humiliating` here
China clearly doesn't want the publicity
Now it just becomes a question of nationalism
But... China isn't filing the HR reports and threats
That I cannot answer, I agree with what China wants, but I'm not sure how employees would find it offensive or humiliating
Why does a Chinese national find it `offensive and humiliating`
Could be lots of things dakota, how :tinfoil_hat: do you want to get?
US dictating the terms of Chinese sovereignty. Its the IR version of mansplaining
The Chinese official position is that this is an entirely internal question of local rule.
we'd be upset if China got involved in a criminal case where someone from Boston was shipped to New York.
I'm not saying we should accept this argument
there is snow in Modern Horizons.
Was going to say, China hasn't exactly been a good faith actor the last few decades. It's virtually the same government that caused and has since surpressed the existence of the Tiannamen Square events.
Point is what does the US have to say about it. Nada
Well, we could in the same way we had something to say about Taiwan
except that it is commonplace for countries to criticize each others internal dealings all the time
its more a matter of how much political capital does each country want to spend.
There was a similar case with Soviets acting on the hungarians in the late 50s
Plus the UN is getting involved
and we ended up looking the other way because there was concerns over a general european war
How'd that end?
badly for the hungarians
I figured, it was late 50's not late 70's
China is a security member. So it's only going to come down to individual countries
UN getting involved and UN being actually able to do something when China inevitably vetos it are two different things.
To doug's point how much do we want to piss China off. Our real weapon here is sanctions. War between nuclear powers is bad
And sanctions with china will probably bring global recession
Same outcome, so something to me
So it is basically designed to mill people
Modern Horizons? What happened to M20?
An amazing classic gif
Modern Horizons was released before M20. We were kind of late on this draft.
There was an event proposed by someone at wayfair to talk about this via a panel. There was a lot of chat on an external platform about said event and the individual hosting it. Someone made a “bad joke” about physically harming the person that was hosting the panel. 
Hence :hr: 
Woah
That's like serious HR
What was it? Another set to follow WAR?
:big_hr_ticket_3: 
Or a special one like Battlebond?
Draft set, not standard legal, but modern leagal
so yeah, a special set
Yeah but you're the one that doesn't recognize the card immediately
no new mechanics, but a ton of old ones
Draft only set? fun
Modern Legal, so it changed that format a lot
Hogaak in particular probably needs to be banned now
I hate how that became a thing about the internet, and now is infecting actual companies. Death threats are just not ok
Probably. Turn 4 I have an 8/8, go
turn 2
How?
<https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-hogaak-bridgevine#paper>
Death threat? 
two Bridge from Below + 1 alter of dementia = mill your opponent's entire deck
they banned Bridge From Below, but the deck adapted.
<https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-hogaak-dredge#paper>
I understand alter of dementia milling yourself
I do not understand how Bridge from below enables milling someone else
bridge makes two zombies, you tap them for convoke mana. so you mill youself so you have a large enough GY for all the delving so you can cast/sac hogaak enough times to mill the opponent
But you have to sacrifice them
you only sac hogaak, you just tap the zombies
But how does sacing Hogaak mill the opponent?
<https://www.channelfireball.com/videos/hogaak-bridgevine-modern-channel-pleasantkenobi/>
Oh Alter of Dementia is TARGET PLAYER
^ video of the old version, with bridges
ah, I see the miscommunication. yeah, alter yourself, then alter them later
I'll watch. This is why I only drafted or played sealed. I'm just literally not smart enough in MTG to come up with the combos and recognize what cards can create these OP combos
An hour???
yeah, I'm not saying I can look at the deck and figure it out. I just actively watch the modern scene so hear these combos explained
its multiple matches. you need like 5 minutes to get the gist
You can tap the zombies the instant they come into play for convoke?
For some reason I thought there was a summoning sickness limitation on the tokens for convoke
its weird, if the creature has a tap ability or if given a tap ability, there would be. but it someone else has a 'tap a creature' ability, summoning sickness doesn't apply
<@UDDE5960N> this is indeed what MTG turns into eventually, is some combo that seems insane to put together, but someone does, and the rest of us play catch up trying to figure out where our assumptions of the rules led us astray to not see this shit for what it was sooner.
or you play burn
Burn?
Sorry, physically harming someone I just jumped to death threat conclusion because internet
Guess I'm part of the problem
Don't mind me, I'm wasting an hour talking to Doug about hardcore MTG nerd out in a thread.
Goblin Guide, Lava Spike, Light Up the Stage, Lightning Bolt
<https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2177941#paper>
So you were telling CJ to play burn, got it
it seems like where CJ would want to be
Also, wtf, I forgot Emrakul was legal in Modern
I just know he is strictly not legal in Commander which makes me sad
I have the Pre Release version of Emrakul. Love that card
you could play the other Emrakul
I'm assuming from Battle for Zendikar?
Eldritch Moon
Emrakul went to Innistrad and messed stuff up there
got locked in the moon
Shadows Over Innistrad / Eldritch moon &lt;- lovecraft block
In other news, do we delete the `:thoughts-and-prayers:` emoji
Is that a jerking motion? Lol 
Weird set
Um, so why is it still streaming Magic Online? Arena hasn't caught up to play human v human?
Arena only has standard sets
it doesn't have Modern
I think so
I vote yes
Aight it gone
That’s such a good troll tho 
at first I thought it was a hand shaking holy water off screen
then dakota blew it up
and it wasn't
ok, here is a weird one:

<https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=22778&amp;d=355636&amp;f=LE>

^ that is a top-tier deck in legacy at the moment. Can you figure out how this thing wins?
Lol 
It should just show a trash can 
lol there's a good chance it will be re-uploaded at some point with a different image
R these emojis on wayfair 
Or just here 
A script uploads all of wayfair's new emojis every day to this slack channel
There is a pretty funny thread in #nonwork-emoji about that emoji on wayfair's main slack
I'm still watching the Bridgevine video. He loses the first 2 games turn 3
So I'm still struggling to understand how this deck wins turn 2
Or how it runs in general
Lol 
turn 3 is more common than turn 2. but to turn 2 you can:

T1: swamp + Stichers Supplier, mill yourself 2 Bridges and a Bloodghast.
T2: swamp, ghast comes back from the grave, player Alter, sac stichers supplier, milling yourself three more cards, producing 2 zombies.
tap both zombies and delve 5 to play hogaak.

Now sac hogaak and replay until you are almost milled out. Then use that as fuel to mill your opponent entirely.
I wanna go home and slee
Sleep
What did you do with the cards from the Alter T2?
you target yourself until your GY is stacked, then you target your opponent a bunch. you only need to sac hogaak many times
So how does Hogaak dredge work?
There's no alter
I actually don't know the details on that one. it still has a high win rate though
looks like its probably just a beatdown deck
attack with some 4/3s, 3/3s and 8/8s
No Vengevines though oddly
I missed that
This is why I'm just not good at Modern or Standard. I just don't recognize these combos for what they are
I really like high tempo decks in Hearthstone
Lots of medium sized threats are fun
you should see Vintage Doomsday decks. Most complicated things ever
Ummmm wtf
Don't you die next turn
you have 5 cards in the library, so not next turn.
but when you play doomsday it means you have a way to win right now.
Gush, Black Lotus, Lab Maniac, Ancestral Recall should do it
CJ, this is what happens when you play with 25 years of cards. Standard only plays with 2 years and has a lot of decks like you described. In MTG we call them 'midrange'
but you can stomp down with dinosaurs and such
I was more saying that setting this card up is dangerous, because you lose half your hp, and you're essential defenseless for the next round
:justdoit:
It sounds like a control deck, built to keep the enemy off the board till you get your win con
yup. true. so you probably don't want to let a next round happen
^ standard dinosaur beatdown card (you start with 20 live, 12 damage is a ton)
So finally seeing the Hogaak Bridgevine deck do its thing
Just curious now how the Dredge version works in practice
I can't find a good video for the dredge version.
oh, there is another turn-2 kill deck in Modern right now.
Neoform + Allosaurus Rider.
<https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/neoform-combo-in-modern/>
It is always crazy to me how quickly Magic can go "fucked that one up, time to ban again"
yeah. their standard is "lets not fuck up standard, everything else can handle bans"
although there where bans in standard with Kaladesh, somewhat recently
that was bad
Why is banning in standard so bad?
it gets played a lot more than any other constructed (not including commander, but that's a whole different thing)
I can keep up with Standard to some degree but never have. Modern I just know is beyond me. I don't fucking try with Legacy or Vintage
Commander is fun, great format, and a really great way to utilize 25 years of cards
I've never played Vintage or Legacy. I've jumped in and out of Modern, but it has been a long while now since i've been in
Hogaak wouldn't be standard though
true
Watching him be used, he is a fucked up card
very true
Like even for Commander
Isn't standard the smallest set of cards too?
yup
AKA they're money maker drew
so its a lot easier to design for
also the money thing
That's true. People not buying new cards and packs for Modern
Just buying off the resell market usually
<https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-hottest-deck-in-core-set-2020-standard-simic-flash/>

^ this is the standard deck I'm playing recently on Arena
I liked playing limited and listening to LImited Resources. That is just the kind of MTG player I am
so fun, never play anything on my turn
<@UDC4QL95G> are you guys playing games?
Not today, too many people missing
Netflix just released new Invader Zim. 
Like, brand new episodes?
One extra long episode. 70 minutes. 
So much new Zim screaming. 
Is there like a holiday or something today
It feels so dead in here
I don’t think so. 
Unless everyone took time off to watch Invader Zim
lol
I know several people who took time off when No Mans Sky launched. That was a bad decision for them. 
This national holiday shall be known as Florpus Day. 
Yup. 
I've seen some people arguing the game finally got good
Like 2 years after it launched. 
They were doing it before it was cool
I"M SO DONE WITH TODAY!
I want it to be like 20 minutes from now
4:42pm?
what's so special about that time?
_It’s 4:42 somewhere._ &lt;- my favorite country song. 
I'm ducking out the catch the 4:58 train
Cause my brain is off
are you on mobile?
And no one is here
No I'm in the office?
or do you actually type the instead of to?
Brenden keeps editing his previous post to make my joke make no sense.

He got real mad when we disabled editing and deleting of posts that one time

lol
Agreed.  
Please allow editing. 
Except when I’m tiffing off a previous post. 
If i remember it was "You can say that again" bot
You can say that again

Really hope that other race likes circles. 
It’s also really hard to encode. 
That’s why we often use series of prime numbers.

you come across a completely alien species, how do you start the process of figuring out their language

Generally I think more stargate personally
why would they set hubot to message people at 9:30pm on a Saturday?
oh, they just did it again. so weird
I got the same, there was an email a while back about a similar hubot message that sent to people I correctly
yeah, its that translations message
i thoguht that was just me since my team worked on translations stuf
I’m not working on translations at all, am stilling getting the messages. 
i realize now that it links to any ticket im assigned to

That's the English version, WE USE THE AMERICAN HERE MISSY!!!
was not competing, was trainign and auditioning- results will be annouced in 10 days but :shrug:
:smile:
ive always been curious..... ive seen everything from underwear to door mats with american flags on them....is that not considered disrespectful and not actually patriotic?
Flag design on things is normal and lawful, the only real disrespect can be to an actual flag. Like the flag should never, ever touch the ground
I shall never understand that
the former, not the latter
Technically the stuff you see is "representative" of the flag, but is _not_ actually the flag.  Wrong number of strips/stars
Therefore, ok
i would think that that's disrespectful but i was raised different ly
I get it, I'm just telling you the logic of it
If you took a real flag and did that, big no no
Fake flags, nobody cares
so its legal.
Yup, flag design on shorts = fine
Shorts made out of flag = not fine
I mean it's all legal Aysh, how long you live after doing it, is up for grabs
In Denmark, the national flag is only used by private citizens on their birthdays. It’s not a law or anything, it’s just how people tell the general public it’s their birthday. 
Yea.... the flag stuff is all... opinion, not law (generally)
I thought the flag code of conduct was law?
There have been multiple attempts to add laws or a constitutional admendment to control all this.
How you treat the flag is symbolic speech, so it can’t be law until you add it to the constitution. 
his is a U.S. federal law, but the penalty described in Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. § 700) for failure to comply with it is not enforced. This etiquette is as applied within U.S. jurisdiction. In other countries and places, local etiquette applies.
From wikipedia
So everyone is right!
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Johnson>
not to change the subject too much, does anyone want a ticket to the Boston Symphony Orchestra on October 3? Its part of my subscription, but I just decided to visit Europe in October and the date happened to overlap.
Its a great seat and Yuja Wang is performing (an absolutely stunning pianist I happened to see perform last year)
Subscription to Boston Symphony Orchestra? Not interested, just curious.
Buy multiple tickets at the beginning, bundle makes them cheaper. 
Also it’s hard to judge before hand which pieces I’ll like most, so I just let the BSO choose which shows I’m going to. 
A very light version of season tickets. 
Neat
Hm, I cannot find my wallet. I might be trapped in the house today.

WHOOOO HOOOOOO!
Does anyone want to do games this week? (other than Wednesday)  Posting here to see if there's interest
Sure. 
Seconded
That took more effort than I expected
Edited to not be specifically American flag
You seem to be struggling Dakota
Slack is being annoying.. made me delete the wrong message
Is :one: offended or is :keycap_ten: offended?
This is vague
The question doesn't even tell you what the scale is
:village-pitchfork: :village-torch:
Given Dakota, and the fact he picked 1 my guess was 10 is highly offended
I however do enjoy a good :village-pitchfork: :village-torch:
Ah 10 is offended
whats that supposed to mean
My job is analytics, i work with imperfect data all day long :wink:
HAPPY NOW
You can never live in non-work-polls dakota
THEY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE THERE
I rarely actually post in public channels
A wise decision
No, what about the "It depends." option as well as the "Milk." option?
lol
Hey Aysh, since you brought up the flag, what do you think of kneeling during the nation anthem?
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._national_anthem_protests_(2016%E2%80%93present)>
huh for some reason kneeling during the anthem strikes me as clever
there is some long and complicated history around this.
(also emojis is clearly still on its turtle kick)
:he-brings-she-brings-he-all-the-way-down:
YOUR REFERENCE DOUG!
didn't even realize :naruto-run: existed
I do not own turtles all the way down.
You do here buddy
No one owns the world turtles. 
The starcraft references are oddly specific
:clearly-tassadar-has-failed-us_you-must-not: :you-have-openly-defied-the-will-of-the-conclave: :you_must_construct_additional_pylons:
It is shocking that there has not be a `you must construct additional pylons` emote until now
I mean there's almost no references at all honestly
:pylon:
just no alias
:you_must_construct_additional_pylons:
:zerg: :happyzergling: :pylon:
I think those are the only things in there
:pylon::turret:
:nexus_sc2:
:roach:
:stargate:
WRT kneeling: i think the intention makes it clear that it isnt meant to disrespect but turn attention towards something. and anyway, kneeling isnt a sign of disrepect in general, dont people kneel in front of royalty and all that?
National Anthem is standing without hats
at least for the US
There is also the anouncement of "Please Rise for the National Anthem"
and the players are already standing, and so they actively kneel after being asked to stand
kneeling can also, traditionally, be a sign of shame. I don't think that's the intent here, but its part of how people interpret it
To remain seated during the Anthem is... not looked upon kindly
Classic Brainwashing
Socially accepted norms is just brain washing
hmmm :think-load: as an outsider, it feels desperate (in a sad way) and not disrespectful . Like, 'look what we have to do to get this noticed'
Well I was more talking about nationalism being instilled in children at a young age
I mean, what does India do for sports?
One could argue it's not nationalism but heritage
India plays the anthem at the start of movies, right?
and it worth noting the only reason the anthem is played at halftime here is that the US military paid a ton of money to the NFL to do it.
yeah, there was some talk about not doing that- because its really not hte right place to play it (especially considering what the possible subject matters could be) and that most people are more worried about their popcorn and itll be disrecpectful to do that
IMO, I would say that heritage  is instilled by parents, and nationalism is instilled by a nation
Halftime? I've never seen it at anything other than the start of a game Doug, in any sport.
yeah, I m,istyped, already edited
k, sorry!
I mean in all honesty, in HS Hockey, we did the national anthem for playoffs, I guarantee that wasn't paid for.
people want to emulate the pros
So I don't see this as a `big gov said do this`
I get that, formalism and all that
big gov said to this by asking politely with money
makes it weirder how much the government paid then
do you have figures?
I know its in the wiki CJ linked
I suppose it was a good marketing investment
since it's now tradition
ok, the anthem itself being played predates this deal.
the deal (almost 7 million over 3 years) was to inject a great deal more patriotic stuff in football, including increasing the spotlight on the anthem performance
More that it's always been tradition, we just emphasize it now
I mean, it spawned Rene Rancourt, who is a damn national treasure
Huh apparently it started during WWI in a baseball game between the Red Sox and the Cubs
<https://www.history.com/news/why-the-star-spangled-banner-is-played-at-sporting-events>
Like how the MLB started playing God Bless America in the 7th inning stretch right after 9/11 and just didn't stop
Anyway what I'm getting out of this is standing sounds like uniquely American
Stupid Americans
Getting angry about irrelevant things
```The anthem’s adoption also gave way to a new American pastime, almost as beloved as sports itself: complaining about people’s behavior during the national anthem.```
very not unique to us or US. Soccer and extreme nationalism together like chocolate and peanut butter

These taken? If not how many and how much?
just 1 ticket. and free to a good home
Hmm, ok. Would want to go with Sam but not sure how easy to get an adjacent seat would be.
you would not be able to get the adjacent seat I'm afraid
the downside is that it really is a solo ticket
We'd like the ticket. There's a strong chance I wind up working anyway that day so it isn't like Sam going by herself would be strange.
ok. I don't physically have it yet, but I'll pass it along once I do
Thank you, it'll be put to good use!
cool.
There isn't a name on it or anything, so it should all be good.

As I mentioned, the featured soloist is amazing, and they are playing a selection of a Smetana piece I really like, so it will be a really good show. as long as someone is using the seat I'm happy
&gt;The system can detect fear at a cost of $0.001 per image.
Yeah, she's never been and had wanted to go for a long time. She'll enjoy it!
oh, that's exactly perfect!
uhh, what?
I'm clearly missing some context here
I actually made the Wayfair :pylon: one
Dakota helped me with it
Is it bad that I'm mildly uncomfortable when :dejavu: posts as me with spelling/grammar mistakes?
totally normal
I posted without context. I ran across the sentence when reading about Amazon facial recognition and it was too good not to share.
They just added the ability to categorize an eight emotion (fear)

:ohno: my new boss is a open mouth chip cruncher for the first bite
only the first bite?
yes
Personally I think getting upset about kneeling during the national anthem to be dumb. It's a pretty clear expression of free speech, and the people most upset by it also tend to try and defend other things as free speech that well...aren't.
somehow that seems weirder than just open mouth crunching in general
it's surprisingly (and unfortunately) common
:hr:
I wish that were :hr: worthy
you should get a spray bottle, like you'd use for cats
And we just posted about a Supreme Court decision allowing people to desecrate a flag or wear it on clothing as part of that same speech.
that's a great way not to get a raise
possible the BEST way to not get a raise
that one is scary relevant
Did Aysh actaully say that and a bot replaced it, or is the bot good at linked words from the previous comment? I don't understand the rules here
previous comment
though she could be fucking with us via code
idk if she's delved that deep yet
<@UDC4QL95G> how does the bot post with someone's face and name?
did you make shadow accounts for all of you?
like hubot always shows up as itself, your prometheus bot does that as well
the first bite or in general?
<@UDC4QL95G>
Slack allows bots to post as people, Hubot does not
There's an entire function in our code for handling the responder
but I'd need your auth to do that, supposedly
Also note it says `Ash` not `Asyshu`
ok, so it is a series of shadow accounts
If you click on it, it says it's Prometheus
It's that when Prometheus post is uses an alias
and since slack tracks who we are through a unique back end key, you can have multiple same front end names
The images are all public too
The names are intentional misspelled so people don't get too confused
has no one noticed that i do not swear? :smh:
I take no notice of anybody swearing
thats a good way to live
I don't swear often myself, but I only really notice other people swearing in what I personally consider inappropriate situations (places of worship, around young children, etc)
I have not noticed that Aysh. Its difficult to notice an absence.

Interestingly, there have been studies that show that swearing (in your native language) lights up different parts of the brain than normal speech, and that swearing in a second language tends not to do this.
I assume you don't swear in Tamil either?
nope, i swear more in English than Tamil for some reason (when Im really annoyed).

Oh, how long do bannings last? I was playing around with the glitch endpoints yesterday and I manually added some words to the ban list to see if it worked. I don’t know if you have to go back and manually remove them. 
_Supposedly_ they get reset at midnight, we have some issues getting it to work correctly
Cool. 
If you go into the ban list now, I only see the one.  So if you had added more, they exist no longer
Good.
Good morning everybody :slightly_smiling_face:
So, weird story. Before 5am today a group of people decided to do a full boot camp jog up and down the street in front of my apartment. Including a drill instructor yelling “left left left right left” and other chants. So loud. In the Dark. In a residential area. So I got not enough sleep by a fair bit. 
Ummmmmmm
interesting
Cause you generally wait till 8 to wake up
I am sorry my friend
That seems like a violation of the noise ordinance
I’d hope so. 
im sorry doug :disappointed:
the most vile thought I have had: some motorcyclists use the road outside my window to speed every night and i wake up to them revving a few times a night. I often have to catch and correct myself when I hope bloody they crash.
Loud motorcycles are just the worst and weirdly common.
We as a society should get rid of them. 
Aysh, it's ok to wish bad things upon bad people
youre like the little devil that sits on people's shoulder in cartoons CJ :smile:
Just like a gentle crash that scares the shit out of them, not a crash that kills them

the right side of the banlist is the expiration time (in seconds) of the words. The file is recreated if there are no words that have not expired in the list
adding words manually does work, and multiple words are supported.
Were they trying to be sarcastic?
No.
I’ve never seen the word inulin before today, but I have a high confidence I know how it’s pronounced. 
DOUG!
oh i just read what you said.
Haha :D
I finally watched stranger things this weekend. Enjoyed. No love triangles and all 'romance' was confined to the first episode.
I’ve not watched season 3 yet. 
ah yes, I meant season 3 only
This morning I got an ad for :
A) Free colon cancer screening for those over 50
B) Pull-up diapers by Huggies
C) Grammarly to improve my homework
D) All of the above

Answer is D.
Wow. You must have quite an interesting search history. 
all on youtube. Google doesnt know how old  I am. I actually got a survey asking me to pick my age and i skipped it.
hmmm it is no longer deleting the original... interesting

CJ is the devil
Noted
Turtles forever it seems. 
HOW DID YOU CATCH THAT?!!?!?
You would know
Also noted
:he-brings-she-brings-he-all-the-way-down:
CJ, you mentioned alien communication yesterday. Stuff you Should Know just put out an episode on nuclear semiotics, which is the question of how we communicate to humans living 10,000 years in the future

wayfair engineers, how many PTO days do you get per year? :start_a_thread:
or at what rate do you accrue?
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDL020K8D> <@UDC4QL95G>
<@UHQD9J1SL>
I want to make sure I'm not getting shafted by transferring in instead of hiring in
depends on level- its 15days l1/l2; 21 days l3 (i think)
each day = 8 hours
I thought it was more than that. 
definitely not for me or any engineers i know
also please post how long youve been at wayfair
Ok, odds are I’m just remembering wrong. 
I think you get more each year or something
&lt; a year ; 21 or 15 (*8) hours a year; can carry over 40 hours; accrues biweekly
&lt;  one  year ; 21 or 15 (*8) hours per year; can carry over 40 hours; accrues biweekly
Oh, right, that’s why I thought it was more than the number you gave, I carried some over from last year. 
Why cant Aysh's posts be deleted
yeh it doesn't look like engineers get special treatment PTO wise, but in exchange, its super easy to work from home
<@UHQD9J1SL> <@UETS9HTSS> <@UDL020K8D>  If any of you use Resources/PHP/Templates, you may find this bash script and alias helpful:
Hey Mac people! (windows people's milage may vary)
I put together a bash script that does the following:
1. If a pull request for the current repo exists for your current branch, open it in chrome
2. if no pull request exists for your current repo, open the "create pull request" page in chrome

requirements:
1. Install jq (a json parsing library)
2.5 Get a personal access token from github
2. your branch name must include your ticket number and NO OTHER NUMBERS
3. Pull request titles must contain the ticket number and NO OTHER NUMBERS
4. Throw this into your bash_profile or bash_rc and run via typing 'gitlab'

if your username contains numbers, you will likely have to modify the part of the script that searches for ticket numbers in your branch.
```
function wf.gitlab() {

  gitlab_key=""

  branch_name="$(git symbolic-ref HEAD 2&gt;/dev/null)" ||
  branch_name="(unnamed branch)"     # detached HEAD
  branch_name=${branch_name##refs/heads/}
  ticket_number=$(echo $branch_name | grep -o -E '[0-9]+')
  directory=$(basename "$(pwd)")

  mr=$(curl -s "<https://github.csnzoo.com/api/v3/search/issues?q=repo:secure/$repo%20$ticket_number%20in:title%20is:open&amp;access_token=$gitlab_key>" | jq -r ".items[0].html_url")

  if [[ -z "$mr" || $mr = "null" ]]; then

working from home is hard. I like to stay under the blankets.
Yeah, I’m so much less productive when I WFH
I'm business not engineer, but I'm at 21 days
What level are you CJ?
L3
makes sense then
If I get to L4 it becomes :infinity:
And then I'll have to deal with the fact Mei will try to use :infinity: days
Was not disappointed

I like it
good morning!
Busy day Aysh?
had a few meetings as soon as my day began so yes :slightly_smiling_face: but productive ones!
That's good, unproductive and busy is the worse
I feel like emoji's give you a window into the sub cultures of wayfair
all subcultures are turtle based
Most notably :im_baby: and :im_angry_baby:
Dakota are you coming this afternoon, or is it just me and doug?
Sorry I never accept meetings cuz I'm an ass
the bot has come unstuck in time
i'll be there
Just making sure in case I need you want me to reschedule
All good
Do I leave now to try to dodge the brunt of the storm, or just ride it out
I'd guess now, but I'd keep and eye out for coffee shops along the way
:bug:
<@UDC4QL95G> this had a picture attached to it
LOL I suppose I should try to avoid that
Yeah, without the pic I have no context haha
It's nice, you've got a salt plate, some bitters, and even the hand juicer!
What's the game tonight?
more bitters arrived today; figured I'd get the common trifecta
They make bitters for everything. You can get super specific if you want to
I'm quite impressed with the set up, and happy to shake up some drinks for people anytime.
thank you sir
we should set a date for that night of less thought intensive games
We should. I'll let you know when I get a schedule with some holes in it for such a night
shameless plug for <#CML7P7HS4|this-is-a-long-channel-name-and-im-going-to-use-up-the-new-full-character-length>
#CML7P7HS4
You posted a spoiler but I can see the message in the original. 
I was hoping the channel name would become a link in the spoiler
It might be the redaction not. 
I'm not sure what you meant
i posted the spoiler to circumvent the redaction bot
Your original still had a redaction. 
which is why I posted the spoiler
what are you getting at?
Just speculating on why the first message looks garbled. 
it looks garbled because a link to a slack channel got messed up
on the back end, that's what the link looks like if you replace redacted with i s
Good morning <@UDDE5960N>
and the rest of you
Summon the silent
I get it twice
The thing after the # is the actual channel name, what we see is an alias.  Apparently Promethues reads the whole message, not the alias
<#CML7P7HS4|this-is-a-long-channel-name-and-im-going-to-use-up-the-new-full-character-length>
good morning! :slightly_smiling_face:
<#CML7P7HS4|this-is-a-long-channel-name-and-im-going-to-use-up-the-new-full-character-length>
it dindt reset
It did, it's redacting a new word in Brenden's super long channel name
ohhhhhhhh  i didnt even notice
lol
I locked myself out of my apartment while doing laundry 
you silly person
just now?
I hope you were dressed appropriately
Whoops
Did you have to call the land lord?
I’ve already done that twice this year. I have a spare key at work so I’m just going to walk there. 
I feel like you need a better system
For the record doug, I love my keypad lock.  Literally impossible to lock yourself out
what if you're drunk and can't remember the combo
I think his better system just kicked in
&gt;literally impossible
:doubt:
I live in the suburbs, if I'm too drunk to remember a 4 digit code, I'm too drunk to get home
I’m not sure Where I would keep the keypad. Out on the street? My door is right on a heavily trafficked walk. 
I’m also not sure why this place is different than my last one. I literally never locked myself out of my last apartment. 
Did you lock yourself out of your apartment or building?
This time just apartment. Last time it was building. 
I was thinking apartment, but if your talking building you'll probably lose that fight
Bonus question, do you at least have your badge on you?
Or are you going to struggle to get into the office too?
I’m going to ask my boss to bring my key down. 
Badge is in wallet, which is also why I can’t take the T.
:big-oof-bidoof:
Doug if you let me know when you get here, I'll let you borrow my commuter pass as long as you promise to give it back
Morning! Having fun generating a shit storm this morning 
WHAT DID YOU BREAK RICH?!?!!?
Tell me about it. I came into the office at 4:30 am cuz I broke incoming UK emails last night...
Well.... that is not something I would ever want to deal with
Did you stay awake or go back to sleep?
Lol i fixed it, went home and back to bed
And now I find out my team's PM's brother died last night so it is shaping up to be one of those days
:disappointed:
is it donut or doughtnit
Is it grey or gray
what? no. neither donut or doughtnit are correct.
*donutor doughnut
doughnut
Bummer
:dunkin:
Didn’t break systems, breaking people 
Morning!
Good morning :slightly_smiling_face:
Good morning
You guys function way too early!

greenland because the president suggested 'buying' the country or something
I think doug was being sarcastic
I could/should have made it more obvious.
or Aysh is being more literal than us again, meaning she successfully trolled us
Chris Farely makes it all better
Hi! Did anyone order a large shipment of Vita Coco to the 7th floor for an event called Kick-It by Eliza? I have some employees here from the company to drop it off with no contact name or other information sadly :disappointed: DM me if its you!


followed 2 days later by :


Hey all! The Vita Coco mystery has been SOLVED! It was delivered for one of our wellness partners, KickIt by Eliza, who is currently in the 3rd floor kitchen throughout lunch today handing them out. Stop by to grab some and hear about their classes! :coconut:
This sounds like promotional tactics
I do not know either.
like a very low-key ARG
I think that was me? I clicked a thing pinned to the channel
Yup, that was from when we were still experimenting with bots
:allthethings:
I thought it was real
so sad
What was real?
free vita coco
I mean there is free vita coco
<@UDDE5960N> can you confirm that what we expected was in the box. It was unopened so there is a small chance that it is not the right item
Time Stories
Seems right
:phew:
LOL
T.I.M.E.
WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING!?!?
you can never be 100% sure with Amazon
That doubles the characters and I'm lazy
lol
like maybe you open the box and there is just a ream of paper and you spend the rest of the day very confused on why we got you that
We were going to give it to you at Brenden's today after Mei showed up. I've had that for like a week now, but decided it would be better to give it to you when more people were there
LOL
The only down side is it maxes out a 4 and sounds like :loop: level of replay-ability
There are a billion expansions to the game as well, but yeah it did give off a :loop: vibe
ok so you we need to play this game soon is what im hearing
lol
TThhaatt  ddoouubblleess tthhee  cchhaarraacctteerrss  aanndd  II"'mm  llaazzyy
`"'` that's two single characters, not doubled
Am I crazy or is that a `"` followed by a `'`
beat you to it
Damn
Aysh getting trolled, today is a good day
Man, double typing every character looks really annoying

THIS WAS ME!
Chocolate Ravioli. 
(Same booth also selling tripe)
But...did you cause the chaos?
jeeze
My landlord, and others, are dumping confetti off my fire escape. I would not be able to leave the apartment without being covered in paper. 
WINNING!
Hahahaha
If you don't look closely, it looks a bit like snow
I DIDN"T EVEN SEE THAT DOLLAR BILL CHAIN EARLIER!
WHY ARE YOU YELLINGGGGGGGGG
CAUSE THERE'S A CHAIN OF DOLLAR DOLLAR BILLS YALL!!!!
Yeah, there were many chains of dollars. 
Dakota all ready for the move this weekend?
Also, if anyone needs moving boxes, lemme know
Most of my stuff is now in storage, my apartment is looking pretty bare
Huzzah!
What you move everything into storage for a couple of weeks to avoid the moving frenzy and then move in a week later?
Good morning <@UDDE5960N>
Good Morning <@UETS9HTSS>
That’s a good idea. Probably easier to couch surf for a week than try to move on sept 1. 
Always Victoria Always
yeah, this way I have until mid september to get my stuff out of storage before I'm charged another month
I don't want to play today
There's nothing interesting going on
I DEMAND AMUSEMENT!
Dakota, I hate the fact I don't have access to code search
why?
Why don't I have access or why do I hate it?
Also, SHOWOFF!!!
its funny cuz i'm not even on that team, i'm just in their channel and am killing time while I wait for a deploy
It seems reasonable to only open code search to engineers
I also happened to know exactly where to look
What are we discussing what is Dakota showing off about why is CJ angry WHYYYYYYYYY
ANGER!!!!!!
Cept all of the engineers reference it, and then i'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs
you could probably ask for access
I'm angry because our engineerings asked me to size something and dakota who's not even on a team has all the answers
FUCK YEA I ALWAYS NEEDED :100-cups-of-coffee:
:coffee-fry:
turtles forever
why don't you have access to code search?
The silence
it's only awkward because you made it awkward by pointing it out
Schrodinger's awkwardidity or some such nonsense
Silence is awkward. People are.
I'm happy i'm being amused
It's probably going to be a slow week for me
Whys that
time is relative
Just waiting for approvals for my plans
Which is just a coordination and time thing, not a do stuff thing
What kinda plans
I built a couple of strategy decks of where we need to take large parcel services in the near future
But given what that involves, we need to get my leadership on board, to go argue with other leaderships
ew large parcel is gross. Medium parcel is the future
Medium Parcel goes LP or SP
That's why it's the future
Tiny parcel.
Sure, cept it seems they're doing a 180 on the "WHOLLY SHIT THE SKY IS FALLING!!!!" from last year
Wait, please tell me Tiny parcel isn't a thing
huh?
its the future of everything! no parcel dimension longer than 1 inch!
So you are saying we are gonna become Capsule Corp
see, Victoria get s it
Ohhhh last year around this time Medium parcel was a big deal.  Now they're spinning down the team because Fedex isn't trying to screw us
I'm pretty sure tiny parcel is a thing
really?
It goes Tiny, small, medium, large
oh, I've never heard of Tiny Parcel. weird.
Tiny is straight injection into USPS, Small is Fedex/UPS, medium is Fedex/WDN, large is WDN
This is what I get for sitting in our logistics org
Basically tiny parcel = envelopes
There is also "no parcel"
(digital delivery)
(I don't think anyone calls it "no parcel")
Habitat for Humanity orders always screwed things up
also CJ, that is very US-centric. What about German carriers ?
Also what about products that are both physical and non (Bedguard)
Good. Ship statuses are too old to change
Digital guarantees are not things we have to move, so not a clue
You're right, they need to be nuked
EU is still back in the, FUCK IT HOWEVER IT GETS THERE IT GETS THERE!
When I was in merch (ages ago at this point) non physical products (warranties, gift certificates, etc.) were sent via email
So it would be outside the logistics network and owned by the marketing team or a merch team closely associated with marketing
Bedguard is treated as pure physical
wtf is bedguard?
it guards your bed
so a warranty?
(a bed liner that also acts as a warranty)
The liner gets shipped (probably SP) the warranty is either a different sku that I don't care about, or it's just handled another way
nope
one sku
we ignore the warranty part until a customer calls in
well there ya go, answered your own question!
the loud 5am people were back today. turns out its the US Navy, so I'm not really sure what to do about it
Good Morning <@UETS9HTSS>!
Good Morning <@UDC03KCGK>!
Good Morning <@UDC4QL95G>!
Good Morning <@UDBV9N1E0>!
Good Morning <@UDD45P5A9>!

Good Morning <@UJTEHPEPL>!
Shore leave is generally only a few days, so they'll probably be gone soon
Call the air force
good morning everybody!
Good morning!
I've not had a good morning, but I can still be hopeful for a good day.
have a 'it could be worse' morning!
:slightly_smiling_face:
Morning!
Good morning!
I found out I have a new pet peeve
OHHHHH?!?!?!
when people upload good reaction emojis, but they're aliases instead of regular emojis so that when you react it shows the name of the original emoji that makes no sense in context
:wtf:
give an example?
someone aliased `:chaos-star:` as `:heresy:`
so when I try to react with `:heresy:` it just comes up as `:chaos-star:` when you hover over it
very poor behaviour
WHY DON"T WE HAVE :HERESY: !?!?!?
:chaos-star:
it hasn't imported yet
this is from today
Boooooooooo
I need a :heretic: symbol too
I love that word
same
which is why I was pissed that I couldn't react with it
ZERO turtles
sheesh, 3
always more turtles
I see heresy
I see 5
yeah, because I asked the uploader to delete it
and I uploaded it as an emoji myself
lol
I was wondering if our importer had something to do with it too
I also added :walmart-ca: :overstock: :press-f: in addition to :heresy:
I feel like the banlist isn't updating
I think it is, it just keeps picking the same 3 words
because they come up so often
well I changed it
twice
Fancy
cuz `The` was the next word
lol
does the banlist know its past? can it try prefer works is hasn't used in a while?
It could. Currently I have it wipe the file if there is no current bans, however it doesn't have to do that
you could have an active file and an archive file
Yeah that would be a pretty elegant solution. <@UDDE5960N> get on it, i hear you have a light week
lol
Nah I've been drawing out the logic for attacking
It's fucking complicated
which is more important, being able to attack or being able to say 'the'?
Clearly being able to attack, i gotta put this in front of brenden so he can break everything
The real question is why it's not hooked up to prometheus
why did the app replace that one? there is no redaction?
Cause I'm a bad coder and jupyter notebooks is so much easier to debug in
cj just has a flat chance to be replaced
ah
It was something I set up before we had the DejaVu bot running to see how well a bot could impersonate a person
you just gotta get gud
That's why I'm doing this!
But if you really want to be able to create useless characters feel free
There's a shocking amount of base level work that needs to be done
Thats why companies fill rooms with lots of low level engineers, and promote the people who think
Being an analyst is just figuring out if I should care, not how to care
All done, Prometheus is no longer allowed to duplicate bans
uhhh you sure about that?
Now I am
Had to make my own function, to repeat most of what yours does already!
forever?
not most
ALL
its literally the same function
Nope
`if (int(ban[1]) &gt; int(round(time.time()))):
        bans[ban[0]] = ban[1]` is now `bans.append(ban[0])`
No, just back to back days
need
Forever seems like such a long time
forever is at least two weeks, right?
here's it's closer to like 2 hours
really really short attention span
I'm surprised there's no :no-soup-for-you: emoji
you can do to the emjoi channel and ask
Seems like too much effort
or grab an icon from google
FAR TOO MUCH EFFORT
`cj`
need
ummmm wtf?
personally I don't think that words should get redacted if they're in `here`
I may or may not have made the `/ban` commands work
also, it's silent
dakota
NO SHIT
IT WORKS
cj
can we unban stuff?
`/ban clear`
you banned ban...
What is the default duration?
until midnight
or will we just lose the slack control
for the day
`/ban clear` is what you can use to clear all manual bans
It also won't be silent forever
`/ban list` will also work
what does `/ban list` do?
and hopefully `/ban cj 5` to ban for 5 minutes
it will list the bans. currently it just logs
yea I saw nothing
```{u'what': 1566964801, u'for': 1566964800, u'to': 1566964801, u'I': 1566964801, u'is': 1566964801, u'who': 1566964800, u'it': 1566964801, u'until': 1566964801, u'will': 1566964800, u'how': 1566964801, u'we': 1566964801, u'too': 1566964801, u'the': 1566964800, u'where': 1566964800, u'why': 1566964801}

lol i cant post the list, but somebody just banned  a ton of words
HOLY GOD MAN
its still going
your can't clear it
I think <@UETS9HTSS> is actively banning things
:chaos:
yes yes he is
this was a mistake
waste land of chaos monkey
Wat. 
Doug on the plus side
Everything you say will be fine

AND he's back at it
your dedication is impressive
to be fair, its much more fun now that it doesn't just clear the message
Wat. 
what i don't get is the order of the bans in the log
it got cleared again
I'm watching the log and this is hilariously
hmmmm
test
is
it grows!
redacted
It stopped
lies
Dakota restarted the server
that bastard
it should carry over
why it's being stored in memory isn't it?
Dakota restarted the server
that bastard
in memory and in file
it should carry over
which file?
server.py
why it's being stored in memory isn't it?
in memory and in file
new_ban_list.json is not updating
{"dictionary": 1566964801}
nothing updates in real time in the file list
I think it's broken
I'm just telling you every time it restarts
broken?
that list gets smaller
and then it grows as brenden keeps adding
probably cuz I restarted AS he was adding
Are you trying to ban every word brenden?
I don't know what you're talking about
Nothing is banned
HOLY FUCK THAT THREW AND ERROR!
Dakota restarted the server
that bastard
It's what I do
I break stuff
yeah there are bugs
it should carry over
HOLY FUCK THAT THREW AND ERROR!
Nothing is banned
non alpha ban?
It's what I do
I break stuff
yeah there are bugs
hmmmm would not have expected that to error
which file?
Does the error mean nothing is banned?
more likely is that the redacted functionality isn't working
but words are still banned
non alpha ban?
hmmmm would not have expected that to error
hmm
well not anymore the error caused dakota to restart the server
Say what you want, it's not saving it beyond memory
more likely is that the redacted functionality isn't working
bans and stuff
there's a lot banned words
but words are still banned
not anymore :lol:
and
hmm
:bug:
well not anymore the error caused dakota to restart the server
bans are totall broken
Brenden you have more persistence than I give you credit for
Say what you want, it's not saving it beyond memory

ehhh i'll fix it tomorrow

What was the error?
And why is Drew bot suddenly so chatty?
It’s broken
Yes, but what was the problem in the code?
good morning! whats everyone doing for the long weekend? :slightly_smiling_face:
Good Morning Aysh, more manual labor for me!
Heading to nyc 
U?
<@UDDE5960N> what do you mean?
<@UJTEHPEPL> ooooh my fav :heart: what do you intend to do there
We've been redoing the house I use to live in.  So just doing more of that this weekend
Just hang with friends and bf, that’s where I lived before moving to Boston 
Im having a staycation- brother and sister in law are visiting me :slightly_smiling_face:
ah nice!
Omg I got hijacked by bot Rich
Not nice, giant pain in the ass!
You used the WRONG WORD friend
youreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee OUT
I’m not w/ this
Don't worry we now have the capability to add more words!
No longer are we locked to a single random word! WE CAN ADD OUR OWN FOR MAXIMUM :chaos:
How does one add more words
Or more :monkey: 
`/ban word`
It's a silent ban, so no one knows what you're up to
Morning 
Hm ... fail 
Might still be brokend
:skull: 
morning
Morning 
morning
it's dead dead
I'm not sure where it's suppose to trigger redact
I'm blaming dakota!
lol
lol why you banning things if bans are broken
:mtg_black::mtg_green: but they just banned Hogaak. clearly bans works. :mtg_black::mtg_green:
Why do your emojis not have weird spacing on it 
I manually go back and remove the spaces between them
:oh: 
with
lol so manual bans broken, normal bans not?
Yes
heh

and if or but
alright manual bans work again
Lol
well then

:bug:
not working

lies
i totally didn't just fix it
but i tried and it didnt work
hmm let's see if this worked
I totally didn't just break it
lol so there is a bug that modifications to the server tend to clear the ban list
:bug:
Active development is not a bug
I think you're missing a space
who is missing a space?
nowis
now
looks like a bug
Ban
See it works now
*/ban* failed with the error "operation_timeout"
UGH why doesnt it work :disappointed:
lol I think brenden is spamming too hard
server cant keep up
with the display messages in slack, now its more performance than tripwire.
hmm let's see how bad this has gotten

no yes the is ar
I just tried to see if you could ban a phrase unsing quotes. Prometheus didn'
Currently I have it split the text on spaces, and if it detects more than one word, it takes no action
well, that answers my next question, if you could ban spaces
or puncuation
/mega giga-thomas

those are my roommates cat
KITTY!!!!
They're anti-mei devices
I had #nonwork-emoji going for awhile
it was great
Nice
i've since swapped with:
I noticed
spades is trump? but I have both red bowers!
Why is spades always trump
Convention
Gods
Mortals
I guess we’re playing Spades, not Euchre 
Mid quest people and their weird ass games
That’s not even that far out there. I’ve played games where crowns or moons could be trump. 
:wat:
Five crowns has hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades, and stars. 

Fox in the forest has Bells, Keys, and Moons. 

Playing on a traditional tarot deck has coins, swords, cups, and batons. 
wait
????
I've never actually seen a tarot deck
ban are see not
alright bans are much faster now
:bug:
emojis still dont work
:bug:
I had one, but I think I threw it out in the move. Many old Italian and French games are built around them, but you have to go looking for old italian or French card games. 
I think i liked it better silent
because now I have to see brenden's handy work
soooo much effort...........
why is this a lot of effort
why is this a lot of effort
:chefs_kiss:
Wow, there is like 8 pages between characters comment and my response 15 seconds later. 
I feel like the list has a cap
like it's a rolling list
so as I add more words, others get dropped
does that make sense?
Tell Prometheus to quiet down. 
I think its because every time I see brenden banning a ton of words, I start fixing bugs i notice and that causes dropped events
Also the bans are asynchronous, so if two bans come in at the same time, it is likely that one will override the other
test
wait, what?
Ummmmm
there they are
that list in intesnse
isn't it though
noooo
ASS HOLES!!!
You made me snort outloud
lol so I have some code commented out that will ban a random number of words whenever it detects the banlist is empty
let /ban accept multiple words as arguments
I just uncommented it and set the minimum to 500
and ban them all, or ban them as a phrase
bans 500 words?
I made it ban 500 words if the list was clear
That seems... excessive
And then I turned it off
it was just an example
oh
darn
hmmmm
UH OH!
```#   if not bans:
#     bans = getNewBans(event_constants.NUMBER_OF_BANS, expiredBans)```
this is what you are looking for <@UETS9HTSS>
hmm?
I've been in there all afternoon
Ohhhhhh
That was scary
lets not dakota
let's not
:noice:
see spot run, run spot run
All words where pulled from this channel's history, and should be unique
I'm glad to hear that I wonder if it can't handle contractions very well
shouldn't wouldn't can't isn't aren't it's
:chaos:
is not!
500 is extreme
a bit, yeah
perhaps two hundred would be better
For sure. I just wanted to see what it would look like
lol
GRAVEYARD OF COMMETNS!
We are safe again
huzzah!
I kept interrupting brenden, I just wanted his dream of excessive bans to come true
<@UDC03KCGK> you should have some fun reading this conversation
you should make a slash command that does that temporarily
so if we see a lot of conversation going
we can /chaos or something
:man-facepalming: :facepalm:
and bans go for like a full minute
Have the bot throw in random sentences of just redacted words to add to the chaos as well
welcome to how the insanity gets made
nah, `/ban` was good enough for me for a while
I might make the saving to file more reliable though
For now, there will forever be a minimum of 2 bans
You need permission???
Interesting
oh interesting
a
I can punt Brenden but not Dakota
odddd
ok now there will be 2. one visible one invisible
I am the owner of the channel
i can punt cj
you guys probably also cannot see the .env file
i can see it
No I can
oh really, can you see anything in it?
yea
I can punt Brenden but not Dakota
DO YOU WANT ME TO SHARE THE SECRETS!?!?!
Too late
huh interesting. those are supposed to be secret
fail
those just let anybody who knows them to post messages in this channel ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Kept me entertained during my layover
Hard as hell to read though. Just came up as "200+ messages"
Phew, finally caught up from the last week
Lol
Y'all had fun with a new bot
Meanwhile I got hooked into thoroughly reading the Wikipedia pages on Cruisers and Battleships
Ok....
Look, I really like naval military history
Can't have naval military history without destroyers!
Who's gonna sink the subs or all the other shit that keeps the big boats going!
I mean most naval ships of a certain size have torpedoes or another large munition, you don't have to be a destroyer
But that's what they do! You don't risk big ships against little guys, you send the small fry! Also depth charges!
I have the page up for destroyers too actually
<@UDC03KCGK>

Suprisingly no train today, have to drive to Stoneham after work :smile:
Lol why do <@UHQD9J1SL> and I sharing a gif? I guess it is a buffet 
you cant share in a buffet
LOL!
that guy definitely didn't share
because you were both getting food related
And I was lazy
Is anyone else having a problem with slack loading pictures?
no, although the emote you left my comment in dnd channel is weirdly blank
I'm having it both here and in Wayfair slack
Have you tried restarting slack?
Tried reloading it, but not restarting
Yea no dice, weird
restart it 3 times
YEA IT MAGICALLY FIXED ITSELF!!!!
I still can't see your emote.
maybe it works now maybe it doesn't

Yup.

deploy issues suck
deploy sucks
Only way to reliably deploy is to get in before like 8AM
I think the deploy service account doesn't have permission to do what I'm asking
:rip:
the whole announcement thing is kind of noisy
Well the point was to discourage people from abusing ban powers
It could be moved to a new channel
but slash commands work anywhere
moving the notifications to a new channel would be nice
what to name it though
#friend_computer
#welcome_to_the_machine
#enter_the_matrix
#ban_hammer
anything but a name with underscores
literally anything but that
like chaos_monkey?
yeah, I hate it
it is possible to rename channels
yes, CJ can rename <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
CJ is the person who forced it to be <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
I like underscores
<@UETS9HTSS> this was supposed to be working when you were invited to the channel
I'm not happy that that is an emoji
because spoiler?
Yep
Didn't spoil me, but that's kind of like telling someone watching GoT for the first time what happens in episode 9 of the first season.
Someone
Woot, I am winner today
what happens in episode 9 of season 1????
Write a bot that redacts the whole message if one word is redacted!
Nope
I like the way you think Aysh
Why not just ban 1000 words
is aysh exempt from redaction
Have you seen GoT?
or are bans broken
oh
you nerfed it
i made an update
sorry
_sigh_
bans are now posted in the underscore channel
no :smile:
Someone
Is
There are 2 variations of bans
So how many auto bans are there?
I am. Inevitable.
1 is daily and hidden
the rest are manual
Well, have you seen the good place?
If you punctuate normally, does that mean the last word of a sentence can not be banned?
You separate on spaces. 
yes
So only 1 hidden daily? Thought there was talk of 2
is doug exempt?
yes
Everybody who does not have impersonation is exempt from any bots that delete messages
Can we modify the manual ban to be capped at 1-5 words?
At which point new bans just replace older bans
It's possible
You'll make brenden sad
You missed the 500 word banns
they were great
`/ban clear` is always there if you get fed up
I like trying to piece together what you all are saying
Goes too far.
I'll reduce it
ban cj
`/ban 100`
darn
yessssssss
oh
so there's that
yeah this is the true chaos that I enjoy
give me more of this bullshit
well then, that changed fast
`/ban x` now takes numeric arguments to ban X number of random words
testing spaces
testing spaces
test spaces?
Dakota say hi
hi
whoops
Sorry I was refactoring Fire/Box and wanted to make sure it still worked
Dakota say hi
Thanks for participating in this test of how dumb is CJ
hi
So yeah, it's a game changing moment. Hence I hate this kind of spoiler.
/unown test
Somebody removed a comma and broke prometheus
test
you can say that again
lol we overdid it
Dakota why do you have a dolly?
WHY ARE YOU SELLING A DOLLY!?!!?!
you're asking someone who just moved why they have a dolly and suddenly have no more use for it?
Because he needs it to move back in
And I don't expect dakota to purchase one, you like borrow it, or rent it
Dolly's are like the thing you keep in the closet till you need them, because you're always going to need a dolly!
I don't have a dolly. Should I?
all you need is to know a person with a dolly
If you don't, then you need to be the person with a dolly or convince someone else

My roommate bought the dolly and moved out. I don't need it
so now its just free money
People are dumb
I mean he flew back to indonesia. I don't think he wanted to bring it with him
Still buying the dolly is silly
I tried to tell him. It's been sitting in the closet for over a year now
How much you selling it for?
Found it already I see
5$
Huh, wonder what triggers it
Random chance
Ah, the Yoda curse
Like most other triggers here
Not quite
I'll piece it together over time
I'll only correct you if your wrong
So like "you're"?
$5 for a dolly and no takers yet?
Lol
Yes
That seems to be going off a little too frequently
Feels slow on mobile
What did you set the odds to?
10%
Same as me and brenden
I might lower it
1/20 or so
Emoji spam is 10%?
No me being replaced by a bot is
Man, if I type a long enough message and it gets replaced, that'll be kind of hilarious
How frequent us this one?
<@UDDE5960N>
Emoji spam is lower, I might look to see what Dakota's ping rate is
Yeah, he usually does pretty conservative like 1/25, 1/50, and 1/100. Dave's bane is like 1/200
That's the point!
Well then 1/10 would be to frequent
Its gonna take me a while to get tired of this
wait, does it randomize the whole sentense?
Cause I want it too
Clearly. So you like the increased frequency?
So you enjoy the increased frequency?
i didn't ask why lol
I can't edit, can only delete and retype
correct, at that point it isn't your message anymore
Yep, figured
You can delete it and retype
This feels circular, I already said that
Whoops sorry I'm dumb
I think we are all arguing the same thing
I'm not complaining, just noting you have it on a very different frequency then Dakota. For better or worse
I am a fan of controlled chaos
We can change it if necessary
Should be funny not annoying
really depends on how active drew is
Yes
So far I have no complaints, just interested in the decision making process
if he only says one or two things in an hour, then its nothing but funny
but in a very active discussion, i can see it getting annoying
Lazy its already in the refactored code
So blame Dakota the code is on its 5th iteration
I'd say thats a good thing
I'm definitely copying to clipboard any paragraph length comments
if you remember
Lol
Hehehehe
eventually this channel will jsut be prometheus personas talking to eachother
Subreddit simulator
Oh man, this channel can reach that
So slow on mobile
Like it feels actively slower than redacted bot
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Fix your code!
Not my code, it's all the same
Its probably the taking a sentence, splitting it, randomizing, and recombining it
O(N!)?
Should be 3N
Not N!
Idk, you could ha e done it a very difficult way. 
Lol
Thanks Doug
Some people like bogosort. 
Randomized not sorted
Well, just sort first, then go backwards. 
uhhhh?
Same!
You can come to our game night early aysh?
so- i was cleaning my fridge last evening and the glass partition thing Shattered as I was washing it in the sink.

Glass in the garbage disposal, counters, floors, inside the fridge as well somehow
Oof. 
Is that a yes? I'm confused
Also good morning everyone!
i cant make games, have family visiting me
what I don't get is what you were doing that caused it shatter
Did you run it under hot water after taking it out a fridge?
were you banging it around?!?!?1
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?!?!!?
it slipped!
Ohhhh so you dropped
I stopped caring
lol
Well it probably was tempered glass so that when it breaks it just shatters like that instead of breaking into larger chunks
yes which is safer, right?
notice how there's no large sharp edges
for stabbing
so- useless in a serial killersituation
you probably have kitchen knives
The edges will still be sharp, but alas unable to be used for stabbing
can be used for a home alone style trap though
You'd have to put some real work in to cause damage with those tiny shards Victoria
flichette
More like torture by making people swallow it Aysh
grapeshot
..... I feel like, in this scenario, YOU are the serial killer
Kitchen knives mean you have to be close to be useful, you should keep an old tube sock full of quarters, allows for safety distance
Grapeshot sounds like a fun use, I'm just not sure what to load it into?
kitchen cannon
maybe i should stow tiny bags of curry powder in random places
nice. chemical warfare
Refurb is potatoe gun?
bonus points if it cooks the potato. multi-use tool.
or curries the potato.
I was thinking putting the glass shards/grape shot into the potato gun
But on the curry powder note, put the powder in with the glass
yeah. then when the killer breaks in you get to say "set your cannons from potato to kill"
...but why would I warn them?
Ayshu assassin
I just started playing Sekiro, Dark Souls with stealth. very satisfying backstabs.
I like where this conversation went. Albeit, the potato gun filled with glass shards and curry powder would be effectively low speed buck salt.
Huh, so this came out this year
Also I think I can be too active for 1/10 scrambler
interesting. Its like the horror version of Groundhog day.
or maybe more like _Run Lola Run_

eh, I get it. I know I use gender-neutral guys a lot, coming from the midwest, but I have been trying to change that as it rubs some people the wrong way
Teresa Wolf always says 'friends' for a group of people. I think that's a nice one.
Yeah, i make an effort to not use guys, however if I see somebody non-sarcastically add that to a post, I'll still get mad
I typically use all
true, the emote is a little aggro
This is why southerners say y'all, everyone's a y'all and if you have a large group you always have the all y'all
it is a very useful term
is using `guys` a midwest thing?
that is what I've heard. maybe we need CJ or Drew to confirm if it was local for them or not.
guys is local to NY as well
What about gender neutral "Man"
ex. "Man, that's not cool"
man feels 90s
gender neutral man seems worse than guys
really we need to go back to man, woman, wereman, but I'm probably not going to win that fight.
Guys is local NE
ok, not a midwest thing then
Guess it's just everywhere
I might bring those three emojis up in #nonwork-emoji
you're.a.monster
bring them up in activism
thinking about it, if they were just rephrased i would be fine with them
doug is right `did-you-mean` seems overly agressive for how they will be used
but how would you rephrase it without it being annoyingly passive aggressive
To me it's the retard/sped/special needs argument
`gender-neutral-term`
No matter what you do, languages change meaning over time, and whatever you don't like will just co-opt a new word
`did you mean` is so much more aggressive than `I'd prefer you use`
I think brenden got it right here
man, im actually suprised at the support of brenden's stance in the emoji channel
I kinda expected drama, but people seem to be agreeing
That's because it's not politics
Those people are reasonable
I actually don't mind the emote existing, if it were rephrased. but also I'm not particularly attached to it continuing to exist.
"Guys" was something growing up in Oregon too. So not a Midwest thing. Felt like it was used in a lot of cartoons growing up
"Come on guys, let's go take on ______"
That said, I'm terrible about using it all the time when I could be using something else. Didn't grow up in the South at all, but damn have I found y'all useful
The horror version of Groundhog day is "Happy Death Day"
Fun movie, not too scary, and funny
yeah, I definitely try not to use guys when I'm writing or typing, but do fall back on it way too often in speech
Dakota, you broke Brenden
<@UDC4QL95G> if all my posts are going to be replaced, I request admin permissions so that I may delete my own posts
sure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
gratz on your new admin status
thank you sir
can my bot name use a random, non 'y', vowel for the vowels in my first name?
first and last?
no, just first
the last one might get weird
like Brondin?
or brindan
or do you want it to be random every time
yeah, random every time
actually no
not every time
it shouldn't be too difficult. Currently impersonations are just stored as a constant, but it wouldn't be too hard to update
it should change every minute
:wat:
:wink:
Were those the shoes some dude was trying to sell on nonwork for like $500?
might be
probably
Lol somebody been messing with the impersonations
No idea what you're talking about
Changing on a time interval is harder since the bots work off of events. We would have to store the last time you were impersonated, and check if the last time it happened was longer than 5 min ago
still not impossible, but less consistant with random server shutdowns
can you just make it a variable reference?
and have something update the variable reference periodically
The random server shutdowns are the issue.
so when it's back online, would the periodic updates work?
if there are no events for X minutes, the server turns off, and all in-memory variables are purged
that's fine
if the variable isn't set, generate on the fly
as long as there is consistant chatter in the channel, the variable would stay
my concern is this
a
b
bc
and i suppose as long as the server shutdown takes more than 5 minutes, then what you ask should be easy
if the name changes, all those above messages would have my name before them
rather than one block
don't interrupt that
Hmmm, i'm actually not sure if a name change would be reflected in the channel
interesting
since slack acts mostly based on user IDs
its possible that the changed name will just be grouped in the original, but we would have to test it to find out
if the undesired behavior doesn't occur, then this is easier
yeah, then you can just change it every time
move fast and break things
what's a development environment?
I live in the wild west

I haven't seen that one, but I've heard good things
<@UETS9HTSS> what time are you leaving?
I think after this meeting ends
currently waiting for it to start
winning!
it's booked as half an hour
kk
<@UDC4QL95G> when are you heading out?
I think I’ll be there around 4. 
I'll be heading over from my apartment, so i'm not sure. My team is in a bit of a panic mode due to a deadline tuesday so i dont know when i'll be free
oohhhfffff
Ugh, well I'm ready to go whenever. Can always just go over whenever Brenden does and just nerd out about cocktails and beer
yessir
Nerds:tm: in beer? That’s an odd cocktail. 
yall just play as if I cant make it
CJ feel free to grab the games
So you're all set Brenden?
Cop10 S7. You cannot miss the stack of games
alright, I'm calling it
packing up now
Yea that's so much better
Alright I'll head over
<@UDL020K8D> I got the game
Cool. I’m running a bit late. Will be there. 
Didn't want to duplicate effort
Home
Taking out the trash, won't be able to buzz you in for a couple of minutes
Sorry about your dumb team. Hopefully it fixes itself quickly
It's technically not even my team, but a sister team with a strict deadline and a ticket in our sprint
<@UDC4QL95G> update?
I need to ship an MR
<@UDC4QL95G>  2nd update?
Sorry, I'm not gonna be able to make it. Change just got merged, and i gotta verify it is working
Bummer, good luck buddy!
Eh it happens.
3rd update <@UDC4QL95G>?
<@UDDE5960N>  did you bring secret Hitler over?
We can't find it. What happened <@UDDE5960N>?

Yeah, typically people don't choose cannon sounds for their alarms.
No he's referring to people charging around his street yelling at 5 am

I actually like the cannon
can't fault the Navy for that one
I would try a PAX unplugged

:he-brings-you-the-great-serpent-of-ronka:
<@UDC4QL95G> is there a way to ping a bot to see the emoji upload leaderboards?
Thats a tough one. I have code set up that would allow me to insert wayfair emoji data into the Dev DBs, however prometheus would not have access to those. It is also possible to do dynamically, however that would likely be slow. Both of these functionalities would only work in this slack however
:crickets:

So the volcanos are coming?
basically
yes yes they are
I feel like we're weird with threading, you go into a lot of channels and they don't thread nearly as much as they should
:picklerick:
:i_like_to_move_it_move_it:
Not enough wayfair drama lately
read the dnd channel, its blowing up
:phew:  i feel better now.
I find it amusing that the heated debate was about the accessibility of a game
One of my engineer's last day was 2 fridays ago, and in his last week we had him updating our documentation. Turns out, he did literally NOTHIN
FUN!
Nobody was double checking?
Well there is only really me to check, and I have been busy as hell
I just decided to check today to see what kind of cleanup I needed to do
yeah, he even came to standup every day saying what part of documentation he was working on...
like wtf
lololol
its a terrible kind of impressive
That sucks. I feel like any employee who gives their two weeks you have to just assume will get nothing done
Why keep them for the 2 weeks then?
So Q3 starts, and the dude starts leaving for doctors appointments like every other day
After 2 weeks of that, he announces that he will be going on paternatiy leave at any point in the next three weeks
Eventually he does, and the monday he gets back, he announces that the following friday is his last day
like WTF there are only 3 engineers on the team, and there go ALL our Q3 goals
I was hoping he would at least wrap up what he was doing before he left but apparently not
end rant
Yea people are dicks
And LITERALLY JUST NOW i get a ping that we have been sending german emails in english for like a month now. GUESS WHO OWNED THE EMAIL THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.

he never put in the request to get the LNRS keys translated.... and just... released it...
Senioritis!
I mean, i'm pretty sure I would totally just do nothing but play with prometheus in my last weeks, however I would at least get what was expected of me done
yes because youre a person who cares about the people you work with
Also he's clearly not a person who you would ever hire/work with again
Which is the whole reason you give 2 weeks
Because you want your boss to not dick you over in the future
But now if you were ever called as a reference or a background check to how was he as an employee at Wayfair, you would respond with how he acted in the last 6 weeks of being on the team. Nothing he did prior to that would shine through.
yeah, it certainly looks very bad
Companies only give dates of employment
Anything else opens them lawsuit
That's only if he puts a person as a reference, if he just gives the company name and number all they'll get is a "yes they worked here"
Once again, you're 2 weeks is so _people_ don't hate your guts
Otherwise there's no point
If you're not gonna do work, just be like _*I'M OUT BITCHES!!!!*_
guys, I upgraded docker and literally everything broke
WOOOOO HOOOOOO
now I can't do anything on my local machine
yes
of course my machine is made of pizza
lol
Why did docker break your local machine?
Do you only run docker apps?
pretty much
or are you building docker apps?
NICE!
I always wanted to get better at docker
but I really don't get servers
the new version simply doesn't run our services
lol
can't you roll it back to an old version?
hah
I've been attempting to do just that
:rage:
all because I listened to the damn "there's an update available popup"
eeeeeeeeeeeee
I have shared your giphy Dakota
Good
Activism is arguing about hong kong now. Our chinese employees got fed up with the extremely anti-chinese dialog going on in there
Shocker
Kinda sad our friend never spoke up
she would have done a good job blowing up the isue even more
lol
I mean it's the same thing that happens when people say really bad things about the US
You know what the whole Hong Kong protests remind me of
Is African aid porn, where people only show the images that back they're particular opinion of a region
You know what the whole Hong Kong protests remind me of
I like how people just kinda came out and said they were enjoying the argument
Unfortunatley there was only a small amount of snarkyness
I like how people just kinda came out and said they were enjoying the argument
Unfortunatley there was only a small amount of snarkyness
Though I do understand a little better now the other side of the argument now
You know what the whole Hong Kong protests remind me of
As an american, a rather good parallel would be how we took land from mexico
Wat. 
ur banned son
oh F
RIP
This is not useful. 
messed up a bit of code
`As an american, a rather good parallel would be how we took land from mexico`
is what cj said
I like how people just kinda came out and said they were enjoying the argument
Ah. 
lol
ok now only cj should be banned
Unfortunatley there was only a small amount of snarkyness
oops
lol
thats better
The other word is random ban
ok its working
you should be fine now
asssss
if `cj` is part of the ban list, he gets fully redacted
Anyway dakota there will always be a group saying
Hmmm i'm pretty sure the baddies in the group aren't that self reflective though
Or said another way, everyone is the good guy in their own story
I wonder if anyone has ever done the Fan Theory of the Star War's Legends EU, which is basically that Palatine was building massive weapons because he knew they would be invaded by an extra-galactic threat
That is the story of the bad guy in  KOTOR2
REALLY!?!?!!?
I never played KOTOR2, but I really enjoyed 1
it was not the main plot, but was a very open hook for kotor3, which never happened
boooooo
I believe the phrase is "everyone is the hero in their own story"
Same difference
What is this gif?
NOT A CLUE
but i found it
And I wanted to share it
Fair enough
So <@UDC4QL95G> what have you learned about the pro-China side of the debate?
They basically see the protesters as beeing needlessly violent and shutting down city infrastructure. There are violent actions on both sides.
The cops are throwing molotovs
protests are never popular. look at the Dr. King marches, they never had popular support of the country at the time.
I mean protest are generally against those in power, so they never look favorably
“There are only nine meals between mankind and anarchy.”
Although I've generally head it as two not nine
&gt;And when he is obliged to take the life of any one, to do so when there is a proper justification and manifest reason for it; but above all he must abstain from taking the property of others, for men forget more easily the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony

So 3 days without food? Fuckers on juice cleanses should be labeled as FBI most wanted then

almost zero turtles. I'm going to say Drednaw counts.
Juice still counts as food
:hammer-and-sickle:
That didn't exist before... weird
You make me sad they totally ignored this and kept going on about brexit
I mean brexit is hilarious while this is just sad and one step closer to authoritarianism
mehhhh everyone knew this is what they wanted. I'm also the person who says let them do what they want and ignore them.
It's like school shootings, the more you feed into it the bigger it grows
wait which part of it is sad
Also just to be clear, are the counterprotesters the ones FOR the parade or AGAINST the parade
My impression is that they were AGAINST the parade
Counter protesters are against the parade and they are for Gay Rights
Protesters are the parade and they are advocating straight rights
You made me sad because I was expecting this to be something they discussed and they didn't
Wait, so what would you call a group of people advocating for the parade, but not in it if the parade ARE the protesters
Like, I thought protesters would be people against the parade, and counter protesters would be the people supporting the parade.
Parades like this don't generally have.... neutral observers
So there's generally not a crowd of people just standing on the side walk watching, but if you were to label them anything it would be participating in the protest
I could be wrong
I double checked, my interpretation is right, the counter protesters are Gay Activists
yeah I knew that from teh context of the article
Depending on the context of the parade, they are classified as protesters
But back to my original question, what is the sad part from drews statement
1. The parade happened
2. Charges not being dropped
3. Arrests were made
4. Arrests had to be made
Like
thanks giving - not protesters
first gay pride - protesters
current gay pride - not protesters
The sad refers to you not drew
Because i expected drama, and no one even reated
Yeah that's the main reason why I posted the link
they just brushed past it
maybe cuz it was in politics and not activism
```I mean brexit is hilarious while this is just sad and one step closer to authoritarianism```
Drew called it sad as well. I know why you are sad
Got it, ummmm my guess is because the counter protesters were in "the right" on this, and arresting them and charging them even though the DA doesn't want to is.... slightly fucked up
Wait, how were the counter protesters in "the right" if they were charged with assult and resisting arrest?
Cause the straight rights people are like actual nazis (I think)
Anyway the straight pride people are generally considered assholes
true, but i'm not sure that means they shouldn't be able to have demonstrations

free speech and all that
people only like free speech when it protects what they care about
This is the first time I have heard of straight pride, 99% of my info on them comes from #nonwork-activism, which I tend to see as a not very good source of information
They way I see it, the fact that there needed to be arrests in the first place makes the counter protesters "in the wrong"
even if they have "good intentions"
yeah- it sounds like they tried to hurt law enforcement. That cant be overlooked based on intention.
For the record, the charges are the go to "You're standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and I don't like you" police charges
So I wouldn't blatantly agree with the cops, especially if the DA isn't pushing for this
ohhhhhhhhhhh
Is anyone planning on attending Fig in 2 weekends?
<https://www.bostonfig.com/>
I didn't know about it, but quite enjoyed it last year
How long was it last year?
I can't find a time anywhere
1 or 2 days.
that's days not time silly
We were there for a while, just had other plans
The date is the 14th
I can't find like a 10-5
or 9-3
Or anything!
Other than the fact that it's the 14

I sit an isle down from CAT, and one of our agents are talking to a customer about North and South Dakota, so I just keep hearing my name through my headphones
Ohhhh man that sucks
I love the fact there's shared channels, I wonder if the Wayfair admins will add <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>?
Lol probably not
A sister team of ours is asking us for support on a ticket because they are trying to launch a new product like next week. but it turns out I cannot actually test my code in dev, so they are now asking that I just deploy and they'll figure out if it worked once it hits production.

On my RB, under `testing done` I've written:
&gt;None, really hoping this works.
Ummmmm sounds bad....
it is less than ideal
is it a live product?
go-live is next week I think
meh- im cool with that then
haha, Aysh is far more chill than I am
tell that to my crippling anxiety :stuck_out_tongue:
you project chill well then
lol im kidding :smile:
check #nonwork-activism
they're talking about the response during the company meeting
:a_blob_popcorn:
i didnt watch the meeting but i guess they just brushed off the question liek they brush off compensation/ PTO questions ?
probably. I never watch the all-company meetings
yeah, they brushed it off
we already addressed that, let's move on
or something lke that
<http://va.newsrepublic.net/al/RNRfQc>
that's mildly terrifying
oof
I don't like how union negotiations are going, why don't I sabotage a plane so I get more overtime
they could try to reach out to employees more generally instead of re-enforcing their own echo chamber and congratulating themselves on spamming a very low participation poll
:ohno:
used to be every month. I'm enjoying using the same password for a year
I miss summer
Alright, somebody please tell my why people in #politics are scared of people wearing red hats?
Maga hats I assume. 
whats a Maga hat.
Not sure I wanna google it at work if its freaking people out
MAGA. Make America great again. The trump red hats. 
I’m just assuming. I haven’t looked at the channel. 
Oh ok. So people are afraid of people openly supporting trump/
When did the faux bot personalities of everyone get updated to be way too obvious?
wanna try that again?
When did the faux bot personalities get updated to be way too obvious?
I’d have to check the channel for context. The red is also kind of the most obvious version, not just trump, but clothe yourself in it. In your face style. 
I mean only have of them were actually subtle at all
<@UETS9HTSS> got bored of them and made some updates
they were referencing some tweet about people having to do a double take and getting nervous whenever they saw somebody in a normal red hat
It's the sign of a trump supporter, not just a trump voter. The people who openly wear those hats are the more extreme supporters of Trump, and a very good indicator on who that person is.
Oh, then yess, that’s referencing the maga hats. 
It really is a mark of identity at this point. 
Which sucks, because my red sox hat is red
Eh, not a fan, but not going to go change it
since I never actually confused them with real people (cj as the exception) I didn't think the names needed to be very similar
hmmmm
interesting. I though cj might have flipped the ban code on me
guess not
no, that was me bluffing that cj did that
Well you got me
:fingerguns:
summer is the worst
except for spring, which is worse
but only because of seasonal allergies
it's way too hot in the summer
I'd rather not sweat during everyday activities
Yea I haven't really been at my desk today
The only reason people confuse mine is because of the generic replacer bot
Which we would move to everyone and make people think about wether it's :dejavu: or a person
We could also remove the emoji
removing the emoji would make it more confusing for you
which I'm certainly not against
more confusing in your case*
what if my deja-vu also replaces spaces with -
with `-`
that could add to the chaose
it could, but it would be `_` rather than `-`
cuz thats funnier
that was a funny coincidence
:pikagasp:
I do kinda want to move it back to _
Just because of your intense despise of it
What percentage of the company do you think is upset that we sold those beds?
Define upset. 
Fair play
hmmm i suppose that is harder to define than I thought
Would it really add to confusion though?
if we remove the emoji reaction, yes
I would guess that the number of people who think it was bad and wish it hadn't happened is pretty high. Probably close to half. 
The amount who actually are upset enough that they think action needs to be taken, probably much less. Maybe 1/20
I guess a better question would be
"what percentage of people do you think wouldn't bat an eye if Wayfair just straight up said they weren't going to implement an ethical code"
there is too much grey area past there
I'm finally reading through the activism and man do they sound like spoiled children
yeah thats the only impression I get from them
I wasn't trying to be pedantic, I was more thinking that I am unhappy about it, but not upset
I love the way their like "THEY SKIPPED OUR QUESTION!!!!" When it's in the presentation
All brenden wants are boardgames
there is a skype field on slack? weird
yeah, it takes like 3 clicks to see somebody's skype handle though
Followed by "THEY ANSWER THE PROFITABLITY QUESTION!!!!" No shit it comes up every time
to be fair, that's just my board games list
I have others
you should have gone with the Shoes one
apparently your wish lists are connected
not anymore
wtf I have a wish list??
well, now the rest of them are private
it has one item on it
this is the most fun item I have on a wish list:
<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EBL5OCW>
for some reason I have the impression that you could run really fast in those
like its a super-soldier exo-skeleton
you can run very fast in those
it's just a weird run
Yes, but making all of your bot reactions have a ~-~?
my text is occasionally replaced by a bot like cj, but my spaces are replaced with `-`
so yes, not being able to tell when it's that or if it's deja vu would be chaotic
wrong.
You're entitled to your opinion, however much I disagree with it
WRONGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
i finished this podcast over night and it was very good: <https://www.latimes.com/projects/man-in-the-window-podcast/>
oh, this is the guy Patton Oswalt's late wife helped catch. I'm going to listen to the first episode.
who dat
Oh, you're not entitled to an opinion? Well, okay then. Your viewpoint no longer matters. Confirmed that summer is the worst.
Patton Oswalt is a standup comedian.
she was a victim of this abomination. sad :disappointed:
wait no
ugh people should learn to write
she was writing a book on the subject, which re-invigorated the cold case and got him caught.
her death was unrelated
I think
`Michelle McNamara, the late wife of comedian Patton Oswalt, may have found her killer.`
What would you assume if you read that
that she was a ghost, come back from beyond the grave to investigate her own death
also, I'd watch that movie
ghost detective
actually, I'm going to google if something with that title already exists.
BEAT YOU
PWH!
there is a Korean dram called _The Ghost Detective_
unfortunately the detective is not a ghost, he investigates ghosts.
lol
oh- what lies beneath?

he did what?
<@UDDE5960N>

&gt;&gt;&gt;It had been a year since Dr. Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford) betrayed his beautiful wife Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer). But with Claire oblivious to the truth, Norman's life and marriage seem so perfect that when Claire tells him of hearing mysterious voices and seeing a young woman's image in their home, he dismisses her terror as delusion. Claire moves closer to the truth and it becomes clear that this apparition will not be dismissed, and has come back for Dr. Spencer and his beautiful wife.
:chaos:
I still have no idea what's going on, but now I no longer want to know
CJ + Ghosts + Horses - Horses + Murder + California
lol
Is human milk Vegan?
if its consensual, I believe yes
What about lab grown meat
my guess is yes, but I am less sure on that one.
wait, nope
turns out lab-grown meat still harvests animal products
I can't wait until deja vu picks this one up
wait, really?
yeah, lab grown meat uses animal stem cells.
its actually meat.
(from my google reading)
wait, im thinking of the plant ones
the Impossible burger is vegan, but of course that's plant matter
But lets say we have the technology to perfecty clone said stem cells, and never have to harvest them again. Will vegans still not eat that lab grown meat in stay 100 years?
I hope so
that is a fine question.
practically, most likely yes. We all benefit from old crimes lost to memory
See what you gotta do dakota is take the first batch of lab grown meat and use that to grow more meat
And then you look at the vegans and say "You can't prove what is vegan or not, AND THEREFORE IT'S ALL VEGAN NOW!!!!"
there are easier ways to lie to vegans
It's like the shell game but with people's morals
I'm not lying in this case
I'm just removing the concern
BONUS!!! HARVEST IT FROM HUMANS!
Make the vegan's into cannibals
And now I want to create a vegan cannibalistic culture
OHHHH MAN!!! THAT'S SUCH A GREAT :dnd:  IDEA!
You can use Clone to literal eat people alive
holy crap, I didn't know this guy did so much damage. its really horrifying
Ah, now I see why that changes things from the status quo
Wow, this spiraled quickly. I think just all in CJ's head too
CJ was a ghost the whole time!
Just saying science opens up some weird doors you can go down for the fun of it
Like vegan cannibals
asked if they could, not should...
_quickly writes up a stat block for 'vegan cannibals'_
by CJs logic, the Vampire you met in DnD is Vegan
You just need a level 15 wizard
Is she getting it from willing volunteers?
yup
Hmmmmmm, Vegan vampires, interesting
you can ask about power dynamics, but technically yes
It just takes a diamond worth a 1000gp
Maybe not that sustainable

Stupid question
Since :dnd: talks about diamonds by worth, if I made a deBeers like company does that mean I could make relatively worthless diamonds into magical ones if I hoard all the diamonds?
How do you pronounce “PEH”
good question
I think the answer is that will be difficult to get to that point before everyone is bored and we stop playing
Well I was thinking more as villains in a campaign, I don't think the party could do it
:thinking_face:
basically it just wants you to spend money. you shouldn't be able to coupon your way around that.
there are a ton of things that actually break if you apply that level of stress. There are other systems that are more flexible and could handle that kind of thing
Soooo my crazy necromancer cultists who eat each other because they have clones.... totally doable then!

There's 121 of them
Now I just need to figure out how to make sure the PCs are there for the "feast"
like Meh with   p
what does that mean?
My team was talking about whether or not eating human meat was actually unhealthy, or if that was just something people said to get people to not eat people
and my manager turns to us and was like "What are you guys talking about???"
So we told him `Cannibalism` and he said "oh alright, cool"
Nice
I got my first converts
turns out you really don't need to convince people. actual cannibalism is exceedingly rare. basically every culture accused of cannibalism is misunderstood or people are being racist
`Would you like to hear about our lord and savior, the vegan cannibal?`
god-eating is very common, oddly
I mean, you really shouldn't eat people, especially with the whole not vaccinating people thing. You don't know what someone has put into their body
its like 'go away youre annoying me' but in a nice way
Also, there have been some reported cases of psychosis due to cannibalism
Hmmmmmm, Victoria, you know a lot about this subject
How is that nice?
lol
also human sacrifice, also very common.
so man can eat god, god can eat man, god can eat god, just man cannot eat man
not anymore it isn't
CJ, I listen to a startling amount of true crime podcasts, it comes up a fair bit
human sacrifice died down a long time ago
In Chinese I think there’s an onomatopoeia that mimics the sound of spitting 
That’s what “PEH” sounds like to me 
I'm more talking on a general anthropology time-scale. comes up in a lot of cultures
We say it when someone says something that we think is like bad and you don’t want to actually happen 
man eating god still happens all the time. Christians are big on it now
Like someone says “yeah you might get into a car crash”
Then we respond “PEH PEH PEH”
Also depends on how you define human sacrifice, as a ritual to appease god, no.  But for crazy ass reasons shure
To counteract the jinx 
It’s all very scientific 
I wonder if it's because the people they eat is not good
Like if you ate good people, you wouldn't go bat shit crazy
ooooh we do the exact same thing but its 'thu thu thu'
Thu like ...... ooooh
its nice because its accepting defeat in a way
Well, normally they eat innocent victims? So I think they're just bat shit
Turns out people sell human milk on Ebay
They really shouldn't. There are more approved/safe ways of doing that. In general people selling milk can really be a service, since not all mothers are able to produce their own.
what's your hangup on human milk today :laughing:
your last post was over an hour ago
this has been on your mind for over an hour now
there has to be some context to this
Well that's a good point, so I don't think the eating of people made them that way

I finished listening to that story. It was... a lot. Really horrifying in a lot of ways, including the fact that I didn't really know any of this had happened before. I had heard of the GSK, but just the recent stories about how they caught him, the ancestry stuff, with articles about genetic privacy and such.
I was surprised by the  politics of it all....
yeah, absolutely. In my head I kept saying, but the 70s were not that long ago, how were such basic things so different
well, the part of about police politics interfering with protecting people probably still happens.
Well my team's discussion on whether or not it was vegan was still onging
more people kept overhearing and joining in
Ohhhh love KBBQ
How did u know?
Asian people are foodies
This is what I'm taking away from my interactions
are there people who DONT like KBBQ?
I'm not sure that is possible
lol
:100thieves:  but no :league-of-legends:?
Soooo silly
it surprised my that nobody ever created the league emojis
all those profile pictures could be good ones
only the poros exist :cry_poro: :joy_poro:
yea
The things we have emoji's for is always so interesting to the gaps
be the change you want to see in the world of emojis
I don't want to change it, I love seeing how disjointed it is, and understanding what people care about
I more meant Dakota
Eh I like my 1 popular emoji
which one is that?
:kill_it_with_fire:
that is a good one
didn't know it was your doing
I created it way back in labs
Hank Scorpio is a rich vein
Now I just hold people accountable by broadcasting their embarassing attempts at clever emojis and inside jokes to all of wayfair
and upload what may be considered propriatary information to this slack in the form of emojis
lol
if the company ever tries to sue you for leaking IP, I'm going to love reading the court docs
Ohhh man, reading those kind of docs is always good for a laugh
20607 counts of copyright infringement
There's no :copyright: on any of this
I have a decent amount of emojis under my name
146 to be exact
&gt;It is the opinion of Wayfair (hereafter know as 'plaintiff') that Mr. Dakota Quealy (hereafter know as 'shithead') materially damaged the plaintiff's business by reveling to the external slack channel the fact that the plaintiff is obsessed with turtles.
there are 20k emotes?!?!
Yup. there is a total at the top of every days new emoji post
oh, did not notice.
yeah it's not super obvious
I guess that counts aliases, so not 20k unique emotes, but probably still a mind-numbing number.
yeah I believe it does
just looked it up, Chinese dictionaries tend to have around 20k entries. so I guess you can now say WF emotes are a fully complex photograph system
&gt;An educated Chinese person will know about 8,000 characters, but you will only need about 2-3,000 to be able to read a newspaper
as of 8/15, there are 17581 unique emojis
my guess is the educated user probably knows fewer than 8,000 of them
but also no one has published an emote newspaper yet
Can emojis be Copyrighted 
but you probably could
yeah. And there are more duplicate emojis in that as well that are harder to detect using sql, since people can just upload the same file as a different full emoji
probably
That’s like a treasure trove for patent trolls
I think only if we tried to sell them.
neither we, nor WF, are trying to monetize them
I mean you might be able to argue we use them to make money, since they are integrated into our automated systems that are run though slack
U can copyright without intent to sell
it'd be like trying to arrest a kid for drawing a nike swoosh in his school notebook
its still internal communication. At no point do we take money away from the copywriter's company
Not true, Napster was free and they shut that shit down
fair. we do not affect the monetization of the host, positive or negative.
shouldn't it be thought of more like licensing on code?
I guess you could say we don't own the images when we copy them to our servers.
so yeah, maybe there is a case
they'd have to sift through all 17k images to determine which are free use
slack itself is also the one hosting the images, so wayfair could probably shift blame
lol
Wouldn't that just allow us to bypass any wrong doing then?
Well, platforms often aren’t responsible for individual publishers. 
Like you are still responsible for your posts on Facebook. 
Yea, but we shift the blame from us taking from Wayfair to us taking from Slack then Wayfair needs to annoy slack to annoy us

I would A) totally do that and B) Mei will try to murder me afterwards
I like the Tig Bitties one.
you can write a article just copying things from reddit?
theyre listicles
also- readers digest much?
True
Isn't that just society? You aggregate what other people are doing
Very few people/things are truly novel
depends on the level. There are only 5 notes, but infinite combinations.

but at the same time, sample too large a chunk and Marvin Gaye will sue you.
wait, why is that Lifehacker?
yeah, really

They ran out of life hacks and wanted you to know you can get judged for your actions
i prefer r/roastme
That sub seemed to get popular out of nowhere
I don't really see the appeal
I find most of them are kinda lame personally
most are
it's not a sub that you subscribe to
it's one that you look at /top/
same thing with /r/talesfromtechsupport
Kinda like the ouija subreddit
Yea but even when it makes it to r/all they're still not very good.  Sometimes there's 1 or 2 good ones
But it comes up with higher frequency than I would expect
Tales from tech support is great when it hits all
my favorite is the underwater data center

Are you claiming 9/11 never happened?
That makes you an awful person
:village-torch: :village-pitchfork:
:lol:
9/11 was a conspiracy so we could go to war with [insert country here]
just like pearl harbor
and bigfoot
:tinfoil_hat:

what war did bigfoot start?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
war of 1812, its why we invaded Quebec

pineapple lobotomy
lol
Why does it look like it enjoyed it 
omg the fruit lobotomy!
because they removed its brain, so now its ignorant, and ignorance is bliss
I did not expect a fruit lobotomy to generate such in depth discussion this morning
Perfect
I'm kind of disturbed by the fruit lobotomy
Got home last night with customer emails and phone routing totally busted.

turns out somebody deployed a change which made one of our models instantiate a new instance of itself in it's own constructor.

infinite recursion for the win
whoa
Pain in the ass to find out though. Model was like 7 functions deep in a rarely touched part of code, and erroring out like that does not appear to leave logs
That feels like it should be a pretty hard fuck up to pull off
```public function __construct($dao = null, $logger = null, $stats = null, $alternateActivityCollection = null) {
60     $this-&gt;dao = $dao ?? new Order_Activity_DAO();
61     $this-&gt;logger = $logger ?? Logger::use_logger(Logger_Names::CALLER_IDENTIFICATION);
62     $this-&gt;stats = $stats ?? new OMS_Stats();
63     $this-&gt;alternateActivityCollection = $alternateActivityCollection ?? new Order_Activity_Collection();
64   }```
nah, he was following the pattern of the rest of the constructor, so it was easy to overlook
63 is the issue.
The fix was to fix failing unit tests, so since the unit tests started passing, they did not do an actual test of the code
but the unit tests passed in an alternateActivityCollection, this the recursion was avoided
I'm not familiar with language
so when that's null it calls itself again?
thats php. `??` means `if the thing before me is null, use the thing after me`
And this is the constructor inside Order_Activity_Collection()
so when `$alternateActivityCollection` is null, it makes `$this-&gt;alternateActivityCollection` a new instantiatiation of itself
yup
GOT IT
That still seems silly to me from a programming standpoint, I'm inside foo() so if bar is null, I'm gonna make a new foo() with bar=null
That new param only exists for unit testing, to enable passing in a custom mocked out activity collection with test data
It seems silly that your unit testing wouldn't mimic how in reality you would receive the data. This makes it sound like, "You need to have a special interface for unit testing that won't do anything in prod"
Well the issue is that unit testing cannot load data
so there has to be a mechanism to get test data into the object you are working with
Yea, it should be a fake db connection
Spin up a function that returns mock data if input correctly
which works, except when your data retrieval logic is done by a variable instantiated in the middle of a function
basically, you cannot for the "fake" db connection if you generate a new "db connection object" in the middle of a function
Is the db call not a straight API call?
It is, but the api calls are all wrapped inside a helper class called a "DAO"
Right, so the DAO should bounce off a function that mimics how a DB would react.  That should be fine, or am I just being dumb?
It's basically creating a object layer that hides the fact you're not hitting a real db
yeah you can do that as long as an instance of the dao is assigned as a property of the object you are using
I'd have to see you sketch this out, I feel like I'm oversimplifying something
ufff!!!
```class My_Object_Testable {
  
  public $dao;
  
  public function __construct($dao = null) {
    $this-&gt;dao = $dao ?? new My_Dao();
  
  }

  function load() {
    $this-&gt;dao-&gt;myApiCalls();
  }
  
}


class My_Object_Hard_To_Test {


  public function __construct($dao = null) {

  }

  function load() {
    $dao = new My_Dao();
    $dao-&gt;myApiCalls();
  }

}```
When testing the first one, you could create a fake `My_Dao` and have your fake `My_Dao` return test data when `MyApiCalls()` is hit, and then pass that into a new `My_Object_Testable` in your unit test
The second one is more tricky
Ok, so logically `My_Dao()` is some sort of public function, with `myApiCalls()`
`My_Dao` is a class
`myApiCalls()` is a function of that class
And since `My_Dao()` needs to mirror production, it doesn't know it needs to be a fake
yeah, and you cannot just say:
`for this instance, all `My_Dao`s are fake
Got it
you would basically have to build out something in the environment to stop `My_Dao` from reaching real dbs which would be a pain in the ass.
Thank you Dakota!
I know that is what we were taught in order wizards, but turns out that’s really not a good pattern. But it requires some overhead to do things correctly, so it’s possible you may not have the flexibility to implement the better DI method. 
Ideally your code would never call a ‘new’ statement. 
yup, and avoiding new statements sometimes causes your code to feel cluttered
:2thumbsup:
Eventually we’ll all decouple and have the power to write better code. Edi, emails, opp, cancellations are all actively decoupling now and it’s very exciting. 
BREAK :allthethings:
wow the infinite recursion, how the heck did that get past testing?
if you make it not null it goes through :justright:
And since it's only not null for testing.....
wow
Thank you <@UDL020K8D> for teaching us all the quote method for getting giphy to be better
turns out SMS has also been busted since 4AM due to a cache key expiring and a bug in the code to refresh said key
IT HAS BEEN A GOOD MORNING
lol
not infinite recursion, but the fault was ours this time
just got my first group mms spam text
scary
tempted to reply to the 17 other people that received the spam
Dejavu has been oddly intelligent this morning
Nah that's how they find out yours is a live number
clearly my number is live as the text went through
that what the internet warns you about is responding makes it worse ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
what was in the spam message?
one of those click this link: you could make 5k a week or some bullshit
But you could make 5k a week!
<@UDC4QL95G> could we install frinkiac to this slack?
You can install whatever you want
You just have to get Dakota/Drew/Brenden/I to approve it
There is also nothing stopping us from just making Doug an admin as well
Doug also doesn't know how to install apps on slack, so...
Dakota you're sharing too much of our abusable power
Or do you want another
:mastermind_top_left::mastermind_top_right:
:mastermind_bottom_left::mastermind_bottom_right:
incident
please don't
frinkiac is the most obnoxious slash command
it takes up so much real estate
and no, it's not free real estate
fair enough
And now I want to add it to see
just use it in the wayfair instance
see how big of a post each command produces
Ahhh you don't like knowing the season numbers
I was called 'girl' by the creator of the activism channel today. I so not know what to think anymore
Context: `girl, whatchu mean...`
WHERE IS THIS?!?!?!
eh, seems more like trying to convey tone in the statement. more like a verbal meme
It was in person. It was pretty funny. Forgot what she was responding to, but the tone was 
me: say something stupid
Her: girl whatchu mean you...
Everybody: laughs
Oh I said I don't like apple pie, that was it
Ohhhhhh
I stopped caring now
I... I don't understand...apple pie is def top 5 of all pies
Dakota is just weird
It's like a mid-western thing, I think
Nah, im just weird. I don't like the texture of cooked fruit
hm, is there a way to do raw apple pie? hm................................
sounds good though. Big fan of apples ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
But the midwest is the heartland of america....
is the banned word crunchy? because that is the most logical word there.
or maybe crispy
yea, but like... Who just stop's where no else is and goes "This seems like fine place to live, far from everyone else"
Mid westerners that's who!
great
Goood
Nope
helluva
really
?
We already answered this question in the main channel
Slacker
I loved in Missouri and Kansas for a few years, it was actually idealic, minus the occasional flash flood and tornado
rough
Crunchy
Fucking
fucking
What are you doing?
Silence Chaos Seed
damn
Trying to guess the word!
But there's nothing out there victoria!!!!!
Lol
It's sooooo empty......
crazy
hard
weird
fail
terrible
It's not in the main channel! It's just people guessing
it's go-od
Dakota gave it away
There were cows
Good
And tornadoes!
...
...
But a surprising lack of cow tornadoes
?
OH GOD!
:upset_taylor_armstrong:
Fun game though
Soooo I'm going with those all mean lack of people Victoria, which is why it's so empty
Reminds me of playing the traingle game whose name I forget
Are you feeling alright Drew?
Triangle?
I mean I lived in pretty populated areas, it was no Boston level of people, but a good amount
The Buddha way game that Corin taught us? Make a rule, demonstrate it with configurations of triangles
Oh Zendo
Zendo
That one!
We should play that again
There is a box copy of it in Boyl
wrong
odd
controversial
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
incongruous
counterintuitive
atypical
We broke Aysh too
I will always picture the middle of the country has desolate wastelands with small pockets of civilization after driving through it
The `though` gives the wrong impression
and I couldn't edit it since it was redacted
Where as the coasts are civilization with small pockets of wilderness
i tried. i didnt do good.
Jeeves is such a pleasant and simple bot
"Here is your emoji for the day sir!"
for now
yeah, but he's hubot in slack
I actually created the job for wayfair nonwork channel
and hubot is a dick
I ashy is usually broken
:single_tear:
IT LIVES ON!
I haven't seen Not Alone Solve since the split
That was such a good game
good
Which one came first?
Since you had a script for porting the emoji already and I assume you just automated that job to pick up the new emoji over here daily
It's a great game once you adapt the rules to make a bit more sense. The epitomy of a diamond in the rough
I also like the fact that I have a post in Wayfair references almost a year after I stopped working there
The wayfair one came first, and I had that other script to upload emojis. After I got the wayfair one working, I just kinda combined them
so now this channel stays up to date, and non wayfair people get all the new emojis right away
You is important.
Drew those were some big posts for someone who gets randomized occasionally
Which makes me sad because it doesn't happen often enough
I needs to be rare though
Ture
cuz I still laugh every time It _does_ happen
what's this in reference to?
Occasionally my messages get scrambled
MUHAHAHAHAHA
oh yeah
that
I think it should have a higher probability on longer posts
so let's say the chance is 1/100 normally
for every word above 8 words, add something small to the numerator
1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, etc
but put an arbitrary cap on the probability just in case
If drew posted enough, that would be worth while, but right now it doesn't trigger all that often
just ask him about magic :smiling_imp:
lol
Today is going by sooooooo slowly
it's only 3:30!
I’ve got something unpleasant coming up midway tomorrow. I’ve been trying not to think about it, but it has made for a weirdly slow week. 
Booooooooo
Sorry Doug
Hopefully it goes better than expected
There is high uncertainty, high variance. We’ll see. 
Ahhhhh that's the worst, because you keep going over and over in your head. Reality is generally better than what goes on, but sometimes you can be surprised
im sorry about that!
Good Morning!
Summon the silent
What does being unwitting mean?
Not knowing I guess
I want to flee but where to!
good morning my fellow peoples.
Poor Aysh getting ignored by data gov
Data gov?
Like FOIA?
#scs-data-gov-forum
in wayfair
Does gov stand for government in this case?
yes
Actually more data governance
Morning all!
:wave:
ive tagged my manager in it. she ignored me too
Morning all!
Added some more omnious parts to summon the silent
they are hard to think of...
you can probably find a call of Cthulhu message board or something with good ominous warnings.
or watch Twin Peaks, anything sounds creepy when said in reverse by a dancing dwarf in a room full of jarring angles while you hunt demonic murderers.
"The gum you like is going to come back in style"
is this an open list? I could trying adding some
oh, just turn on _Welcome to Night Vale_, that's full of ominous messages.
<#CDU145F08|megamoji_test_channel> has the link to the promethus python code
In there is the randomized list under..... something
If you're really interested I could probably find it for you
STATEMENT_GENERATOR , found it.
well, apparently I can edit the code. I've added several
yeah that link is an invitiation to edit
Yea we don't have strong guidelines around here
Damn we should have gotten doug in on this sooner. He hadded a ton of good ones
Summon the Silent
does this mean im gonna be famous?
lol, formatting, the bane of everyone's existence
<@ULZUJBXM5> i think you need to burn a copy of 'the fault in our stars'
<@UDDE5960N> I forgot the newlines. just added them.
to be fair, it was implemented in a very messy manner
so the clowns are owl and the owls are clowns
If I had time, I'd clean it up, I just need to remember on a weekend.
To be fair doug, there's like 20 lines of dakota and I going back and forth on the formatting
The entire bot was just a series of functions in actions.py

eventually we we moved some more generic functions into event utilities, and then created an event class as well
By we, dakota means himself
but the spaces between phrases and the newlines, those should be part of the generator, not in the individual constants. things like that
well, apparently I can edit the code. I've added several
yeah that link is an invitiation to edit
Yea we don't have strong guidelines around here
Yea Prometheus gets upgrades when we get annoyed with it
But that's about it
I'm surprised :tipsfedora:  is A) not already here, and B) not :hr:
dark mode is here
yay
wait :wat:
oh hey it looks pretty nice
lots of emojis are now terrible though
:heresy: for one
Only ones that used transparency
which they all _should_ have
lol
Well you now have darkmode and can no longer see transparent emoji's
only transparent black emojis
I think i'm just gonna stick with the normal theme
Agreed
Although I like your black and green theme
yeah, light mode, black and green
Actually you know, I'm curious, why are engineer's obsessed with dark mode?
:phew2:
lol
dark mode  :aaaaa:
dark mode is easier on the eyes if your coding in the dark. Its like you're saying you want to be in an 80s hacker film.

also, the original terminals where dark, so I think there is some sense of OG cred.

basically I think its just going for a look.
slack is blinding when I'm in bed and my phone is at full brightness
i need quick and easy halloween costume for tomorrow night- someoen help :disappointed:
your friend clearly doesn't know when Halloween is.
its friday the 13th and close enough
oh, so it is. I retract my comment.
my conundrum  is still a thing though
wear black, paint whiskers on your face, you're a cat?
Han solo? Long pants, tall boots, vest over shirt
wear flashy clothes, some crazy make up, grab a guitar hero controller, you're a rock star?
Lumberjack if you have boots, flannel, and suspenders, extra credit for a faux axe
oooh lumberjack
You could also go as the brawny paper towel guy (who is a lumberjack)
put white powder in your hair, say you just saw a ghost?
make your hair crazy and find a long stick, say you're a wizard.
i love that more- i have a lot of unused paper towels and im sure itll come in handy at a party :F
:smile:
mummy?
yes, child?
haha :slightly_smiling_face:
Blind woman (stick with red and sunglasses)
Crazy hobo (cardboard with bad writing, sweatpants inside out, sweat shirt)
OMG HOBO DECIDED!
I am the king of lazy halloween
I don’t think you should dress up just as a person with a disability. 
Im not :slightly_smiling_face:
Sooo basically brenden likes to hide in the dark, that's my take away
I meant CJs blind idea. 
and you like to hide in broad daylight I presume?
I do like to have the lights on
based on your slack doppelgänger, but a poke ball at target and a baseball hat, you’re a Pokémon trainer. 
Yea but it's gotta be red with a white front
Also green gloves and blue jacket
You can probably buy that exact hat somewhere around here. Newbury Comics maybe. 
Then people would know Aysh was going as Ash. 

You could also be Ash from the evil dead, but you’d need to figure out how to make a chainsaw arm. 
Could also get gray face paint and just be ashes. 
Or get a tennis racket and be Arthur Ashe. 
My buddy built a chain saw hand from evil dead
good morning! :slightly_smiling_face:
Good Morning Aysh
You're up and at it early
I try :slightly_smiling_face:
Good for you
The train was relatively less crowded today because i was 10 minutes earlier than usual :slightly_smiling_face:
On the commuter rail friday's are awesom
There's NO ONE!
My bus driver got into 2 different verbal altercations on the ride in this morning, so I think we're all doing well
LOL!
I need a base line for this Victoria, is like an average day 4 or 0?
For this bus driver, it's pretty normal
Last week she stopped the bus to question the riders on whether or not we saw her hit a car on the ride
HAHAHAHA
:smile: :smile: :smile:
Well Victoria, if you ever go missing I'll know why now
You joke, both the morning and evening drivers have this idea that red lights don't apply to them
Is your bus really full, because if it is, I would stand right in the middle and use my fellow passengers as cushions
It is, but I always get on at the beginning of the route so I have a seat
That might be a poor decision given your drivers....
no itll be like she's strapped in- so many people blocking you that you cant get up if you wanted to
If I'm going to die on the bus, I want to do it sitting down and unaware because I'm playing on my phone
Yea! You want to be strapped in when the bus gets t-boned to oblivion!
There are no straps in the bus
Right is why you stand in the middle and use fellow passengers for it
Nah, I'm going to continue to sit
My middle name is danger
Happy Friday the 13th that also happens to be the harvest moon
if only it were also a super moon
in fact it is the exact opposite
it is a micromoon, since the moon is at its furthest point right now
it also is not a blood moon nor a blue moon
We will have another try at those in 2049 next time friday the 13th has a full moon
wait, a friday the 13th can never be a blue moon
why?
A blue moon is the second full moon in 1 month
oh, fair
until we speed up the moon
Wouldn't that, you know, cause the moon to fly off into the void?
not if we also bring the moon closer to the Earth
The moon is slowly flying off into the void as it is, what's it matter if we speed it up a bit
Wonder if humanity will one day try to prevent that
&gt;In about 50 billion years, the Moon will stop moving away from us and settle into a nice, stable orbit. At this point, the Moon will take about 47 days to go around the Earth (currently, it takes a little over 27 days). When this new stability is achieved, the Earth and the Moon will be tidally locked to each other.
<https://futurism.com/a-rocky-relationship-is-the-moon-leaving-the-earth>
hmmm so does that mean the tides will stop?
won't that cause bad things?
or something
in 50 billion years, sure.
Tidal lock just means 1 moon day = 1 moon year
The tides will be lower though
We're all gonna die
for comparison, _Homo Sapiens_ is only 300,000 years old
compare to 50,000,000,000 years
We're not gonna die silly, that's the sun when it literally eats the earth
I mean 50,000,000,000 years is also a long time for an extinsion event to happen as well
oh, looks like the sun will consume the earth before the moon becomes tidal locked.
:phew:
&gt;If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun in 7.6 billion years, then on a time scale of 1019 (10 quintillion) years the remaining planets in the Solar System will be ejected from the system by violent relaxation.

&gt;In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked into a larger, stable orbit, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate. In about 65 billion years, it is estimated that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, due to the remaining energy of the Earth–Moon system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth>
Well there you go Dakota!
so what you are saying is the moon is a yoyo
With an invisible string
Got it. Now I gotta look up what Violent Relaxation means
Probably it's when nuclear fusion is no longer sufficient to keep the photosphere so far away
And it all collapses in on it's self
There's where elements higher than Iron come from!
Nope, apparently it is not something the sun does, but an interaction among suns
Ohhhhhh
Fancy
Friggin galactic instability will cause stars to fling eachother around until things get stable again
by stable you mean heat-death, but otherwise, yes
From what I can tell by reading a single article, violent relaxation seems to happen to a system of stars, rather than a single solar system
though I imagine the heat death of a star could set i toff
oh, I mean the head-death of the universe.
the ultimate stability
Dude the only stuff I'm finding are super in depth papers
OHHHHHHH I get what's going on
so many messages
<@UDC4QL95G> Greg walker in non-work-polls is looking at the slack API too maybe we can make things work there!
The methods he is working with are pretty much the same way I implemented `you can say that again`
What's everyone up to?
Like right now? I’m sitting in the garden. Someone is playing jazz nearby. 
I was creating a ticket
Ohhhh fancy
Jaz in a garden
What's the ticket for Dakota?
Logging and Influx db counters
you sound borec
I would
CJ, go out and take a long lunch. 
I'm doing a learn@work training
I'll probably ditch out early today and see if Dakota and team are doing games
There is a good chance we will do games
SCOREEEEEE
oh man... I am going to make my team play love letter after standup every day
this is gonna be great
Ummmmmm
That seems interesting
Story time?
My team plays a small 5 minute game after each standup. I just realized love letter falls into that category
lol
What have you guys been playing so far?
We have 2 games. A word association game, and a silent counting game
Silent counting sounds boring
You are dealt 1-3 cards from a deck numbered 1-100, the goal is to play all cards in ascending order without any form of communication
it's more fun than it sounds
The second game:
Goal: Two people say the same word at the same time

1. Start with two people saying a random word each.
2. Then, two people will try to come up with a word that is associated with the two previous words, with the goal of both people saying the same word.
3. If somebody has an idea of what to say that relates the two previous words, they will say "one" and then "two" respectively. After a countdown, each says the word they came up with
4 If the next two words do not match, go to 2 or give up
5. if they match, you win
interesting
But love letter is gonna be better than both
:chaos-star: did you make it non transparent?
here waychat just posted this in their channel
<https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test>
ISTP-A
Virtuoso
whers the screenshot
I wanna see the percentages
I got the same thing lol
Tactics and Prospecting your stronger in
I tried to answer as may to the far left and right as possible
but yeah
85% seems pretty high
Ehhhh I struggle with that, there were some neutral questions
Like `Do you prefer to get revenge or forgive` bitch i like to just move on!
I thought about like:
"if I am playing a game, and some rando pisses me off, will i go out of my way for revenge, at the expense of the game" and the answer to that was "hell yeah"
Oh I took it more as in real life, when people piss me off I just try to not deal with them
Yeah, I decided to go with my thoughts with respect to a game, where my decisions would not be affected by real life consequences
TEam liked love letter, not that there was any thought that they might not
one guy got delt a 5 and was forced to discard it before he even got a turn
yup, that
dealt an 8 sorry
got killed by a 5 on the first round. Unlucky
lol
<@UDC4QL95G> how do you track the diffs for emojis
is there a table in a db somewhere?
lol
weird back to back?
is it?
or is it at 100%?
:hmmhmmhmm:
No it was at 10%
three in a row is a lot for 10%
I call bullshit
that's not 10%
agreed
10% not happening maybe
a a a a a
a a a a a
a a a a a
a a a a a
a a a a a
a a a a a
a a a a a
a a a a a
perhaps...
Sorry 20%
That's super weird that it triggered so many times in a row
wat?
Now you're at 10%
Man that looks dorky as hell. Like why would the bus just veer up like that with no ramp???
BECAUSE IT"S MAKING A CRAZY ASS JUMP!
That's still not physics!
Physics doesn't apply to movies drew, certainly not ones about buses never slowing down!
<@UDC4QL95G> are you guys gaming?
yeah, not sure where yet. either 9 or 3/2
We are playing decrypto with 8, I'm not sure 9 would be the best
Boooooo
fine
You better win
Alright now we might be playing Avalon with 9, meaning there might be room for you?
Or SV
Nah, I'm just gonna leave on the 4:58 train with mei
Avalon? :cry:
Good Morning <@UDC4QL95G>
Good morning <@UDC03KCGK>

What's everyone up to today?
good morning!
good afternoon, good evening and good night!
<@UHQD9J1SL> how was hobo halloween?
i didnt go because i am a lazy person
I can sympathize with that
lol
I want nap time
That should be like an official thing
i hate naps- i wake up middle of the night and dont have anyone to annoy
lol
I mean you could try
But i'll sleep through it
you need to befriend someone working a night shift
'working'
:slightly_smiling_face:
<@UDL020K8D> how did you go about creating those menus you have at your place?
hard part was finding menu covers in packs of less than 30
then I just went to staples to buy fancy paper
:and-bobs-your-uncle:
I already have fancy paper from back in my resume days
where'd you find the menu covers from?
I believe amazon? I'd have to look
I am now discovering how versatile the :apparently_dakota_hasn't_been_kicked_out_of_the_channel_yet: is
<@UDDE5960N> write a script that grabs a link to the orgbro pic of everybody in the company
we can make one for everybody
oh god... i figured out how to do it...
Lol
no, don't do this
why not&gt;
it seems weird to re-purpose pictures of people that they put up for company use.
also passive aggressive emoji names
they feel like they have a very negative connotation
when I let then take a photo for the ID, I didn't imagine it being pulled into other uses for individual employees
that's why I replaced mine with a photo I was more comfortable with
I think this could remain an opt-in process
I have the list...
and the script to do bulk uploads
we spent so long asking if we could...
I'd suggest you don't
I wont
I just like the fact that I _could_
that could have blowback you don't anticipate
Ohhhh man Dakota is John Hammond
&gt;I have become death, destroyer of mems
It just turned out to be so easy.
that is also 21k emojis
remember when WF used employee names for randon skus?
I don't
really? that was a shitshow
I'd be pissed if my name was used for a sku
Well that was public, this would be for only internal communication
yeah, they are not close to equivalent.
your name looks like it has been used for skus
it's internal only?
no gurantees that was Brenden particularly
no, external
nah that is <http://wayfair.com|wayfair.com>
they even migrated to walmart
this was last year?
affected most employees
why was that done?
I own this towel
I need some details here
they just needed random sku names.
and didn't think to ask permission?
nope
asshats
yeah people got mad
after the blowback the promised to use street names and such
but apparently they are still doing it
I thought they made it opt-in
?
Nope
can I request that mine be removed?
that towel used to be the only product under my name
now there are 7
Hahahaha that's so dumb
what team is responsible for this?
Don't wanna be associated with a company selling beds to concentration camps?
not even remotely related
just pissed they used my name on site without asking first
cause I'd have said no
Well it is old enough for <@UDD45P5A9> to have 3 products still
were there emails about this?
Chris has 8
I have over 30
I remember I was on vacation a wile back when it happened
when I was on contact us
there was a slack channel at the time, but I don't know if its still open
have any emails you could forward me?
Based on a file commit history that i know I wrote around that time, it was around June of 2018
that's about when I joined the company
give or take a couple months
presumably I still have an email somewhere, deep in the archive, not sure I could find it now
yeah it would likely be in outlook still as well
Oh hell no
If that's actually true, I need to figure how to get his removed
turns out <@UETS9HTSS> is the only Bourdeau in tblEmployee.
I'm aware
I looked
oh yeah, I don't know if my old archives even got moved to gmail
hence my annoyance
my name with this spelling is pretty uncommon
you could put in a talent mgmt ticket, get some info that way
you are also the only kirpinski in the wayfair employee DB
My last name is made up, the only people with it are related to me
Pretty easy to make a case they stole my name
sue them
for all the money they made on kripinski products
or at least a portion
I honestly don't care as long as they rename them and now thanks to Dakota I have the skus
:salute:
I'm the only kripinski in Massachusetts
Lazy good morning!
Summon the Silent
Today is going to be a fun day on Wayfair Slack.  There are 17 people working on the "Corporate standards" thing and `but we are not publishing a complete list at this time because not everybody feels comfortable doing so.`
What is the corportate standards thing? Kind of looks like the Facebook do not use my images text that circulates every so often
It's in response to the walk out where someone learned we were selling bunk beds to the concentration camps on the border
Good morning!
Basically the people who organized the whole thing probably aren't included, and it's gonna make a fun shit show today
So. The name thing. I think it wouldn't legally stand because otherwise Beyonce wouldn't have copyrighted her children's names. :wesmart:
lol still having fallout from that thing :stuck_out_tongue:
My new system had its first critical this morning while I was getting up! Actually, it was pretty good because we figured out how to fix it quickly. So good morning indeed. :)
yea.... it's gonna last a while those people are angry and think they have power
YEA FOR QUICK FIXES!
Yayyy
Looks like wayfair has my last name used on several products as well. It was funny when the skews were internal but they are definitely live.
62 Items have OKeefe in them.... but my last name is kinda popular
black helicopters?
songs?
those two are new, and I don't love them
lol
The activism channel knew that info ahead of time, they probably won't be too upset about it
THIS MAKES ME SO SADDDDD
I was hoping for Drama, but they're being all reasonable and shit
wtf is going on with :power: ?
Why do they look like Poke Centers and what are they for?
Some dude was just messing with another dude
they were talking about it yesterday in the emoji channel
list is open for editing. feel free to remove things.
also, we probably should remove some of the repeats within a single command
Summon the Silent
hm, either I can't trigger it or I broke something. <@UDDE5960N>
Summon the silent
cool, I broke it
Looks like its broken
Summon the silent
Summon the silent
random.shuffle is an inline operation. I was assigning it. ok, now there should not be repeats on the same command. will brake if there are more people than things to say in a given category.
Summon the Silent
Summon the silent
I don't know why it triggered again there
Sometime's it gets weird when it's broken
python likes retrying events when an exception is thrown.
I made :thats-the-joke: today
but it apparently hasn't imported yet
Was it before or after 11:30?
after
wasn't trying to call out a :bug:
just too lazy to scroll up and look at timing
lol
You know... simpson is scarily on point
yeah import is daily at 11:30
The Simpsons movie was just a solidly good movie. You didn't even have to be a big fan of Simpsons who had watched it for multiple seasons. Just vaguely aware of the family dynamic.
The movie made me so happy
good morning! :heart: the sun is shiningggg
Good Morning Aysh!
strong winds on the walk to the office today
Ohhh I thought it was a pleasant walk
yeah, I like the wind
at least when I came in from back bay it was really strong.
Must be difference in timing, or the path you walk, because I come up berkley
I walked to work as well and didn't experience any out-of-the-ordinary winds
Ohhhh how's the new hike?
6000 steps
Sooo about an hour to work?
yup
today is mandatory hackathon day in my team
what the fuck does that mean?
we have our quarterly retreat today and tomorrow
day one of said retreat is a hackathon that you must participate in
retreat to move forward
So like whatever you want to build, you build?
&gt;whatever you want to build, you *must* build?
HOW DOES GIPHY NOT HAVE THE `if they should` QUOTE?!?!
<https://media.giphy.com/media/mCClSS6xbi8us/giphy.gif>
also, no <@UDDE5960N>
they must approve the work related idea and other team mates must join your team
so it must be related to comp intel in this case
<@UETS9HTSS> :thats-the-joke:
yep
This is gonna be a fun emoji to use on people
Chaos bot idea: randomly remove a person's post and then repost it as the same name, but with someone else's active profile pic.
For example, it would still say "Drew Carleton" but instead be posted as <@UDC4QL95G> 's profile pic.
why not just make it from a random bot profile completely
that's confuse people
Completely random would be hard to tell if it was a subsitution for some other reason
What if it makes the name or profile picture match, but its random which one is the real one each time
that way its a 50-50 for who posted the original
OR even trickier, which ever one doesn't match will be the most recent other person to post
Like if it triggered now, the bot would either have My profile pic or my name, and the other would be brenden's as if he were respondign to the conversation
Eh, I like the 50-50 idea but not so much the most recent other person to post part
So, Blood Rage seems a lot less fun after tonight. Doug was right that combat just isn't the way to go in that game and players have to know to explicitly shut down the Loki player early and often.
Last time I won it wasn’t Loki exactly, but I put all my people under the meteor. So still a suicide plan. 
It feels like it should be so much better!
You should be incentivized to win battles more than you currently are. I'm going to read the rules thoroughly tonight and see if we missed any key details.
Well, you are incentives because you each time you win you get glory. 
You also control more of the board and can loot. 
Those mechanics are there, but they don't feel powerful enough to offset the loss of rage AND cards for winning.
Losing rage sucks so much. 
As CJ put it, "The fact that you're carrying a round 1 card (Loki's trickery) into round 3 just feels very wrong."
I still think everyone discards feels more balanced
Gives higher risk reward
Would you still compel people to play a card even if they wouldn't want to?
I think that would have to play test, can't say which is better
I feel like everybody discards would cause a snowball effect for the stronger olayer
But we've already determined that being the winning play is detrimental to winning the game
To be fair, I was too focused on high value combat cards, that I didn't pick the cards to counter the like strategy
Like, If I picked a card or two that would eliminate Loki, or try to trick drew into winning, his card would no longer be a threat
Yeah, it's pretty important to make the Loki player win a battle. Which meant I was picking battle in Yadrissil where if I won, I was still rewarded
&gt;&gt;&gt;“Good Morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.

"What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"

"All of them at once," said Bilbo.
Good Morning Doug!
Morning!
Wait, so how do I impersonate other people in Gmail?
As long as you are sending an email through wayfair's email system, it will be properly validated. Virtually anybody on wayfair's domain could send an email through any engineers devbox using php sendmail

What's up with 02?
looks like some anime reference
Darling in the Franxx?
I just don't watch enough TV in general to keep up. Still need to plow through FMA Brotherhood and Attack on Titan season 3. 
On the last 10 episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho though
Anybody have the complete series of Cowboy Bebop on DVD or Blu-ray?
its on hulu
I think FMA:B is as well
dejavu on point again
FMA &amp;FMA:B is on Netflix
all that matters is One-Punch Man.
Devboxes dead
its a good day
yeah, mine's been down since before lunch.
oh, for lunch btw I went to that Bon Me shop across from Happy Lamb. cash only, but a good amount of sandwich for $4.50
What have you guys been up to?
I've have diagnosis work that does not rely on my VM
I have been in meetings and trying to track down a bug that happened last night for exactly 1 hour and then went away
ayy devbox has returned
ish
sounds like there are still some incidents
on the bright side, my team won the mandatory hackathon
so I have an extra week of PTO to use now
what?
your team can give out extra PTO?
Damn son
What did you do, and how do I get in on the sweet sweet loot
:loot:
wait what? I thought they only gave out PTO to sales people
I've never heard of extra PTO being doled out
When I was on merch, they gave unofficial PTO, when you wanted to cash in you just told your manager
crazy
its off the books
:boom:
I did next to nothing
lol
I joined the team that had the sexiest idea
machine learning based web scraping
_fancy_ does it even work?
Isn't that mostly what you do already?
we scraped product names from a few competitors we've never crawled before training the algo using only one competitor
it's a very basic POC
we build web scrapers tailored to specific competitors right now
Ohhhhhhh
so hard coded xpath and such
lxml
api json responses
Sooo basically you're training skynet
I offered to donate one of my PTO days to the team member that did all the work
:terminator:
Did you at least work on the presentation!?!?!?
barely
we had 9 people on the team
so it was like having too many hands in the cookie jar
That's way too many people on a hackathon project, no more than 5, preferably in the 2-3 range
yeah, I was also confused
you're going to give out a week of pto to 9 people?
Was your the largest team? Or were other teams of similar scale
Ohhh you know what you should have done PMed that shit
9 weeks work is a loooooot of money
Espeically if they actually add it to your workday amount
since only 5 carry over, you can be damn sure it will be used
Hmmm
Ummm in prod?
There is much worse in prod than a creative comment. 
soon to be in prod
Who am I to block that poor engineer's creativity
I own both on Blu Ray though
Ahhhhhh got it
Good Morning Everyone!
Summon the Silent
Well that's different
<@ULLQNJ8LX> was feeling slow today and I got to do weird stuff
good morning!
did everyone (at Wayfair) get your new comp sheets?
hahahah jokes on you, I am ALSO old!
I’ve not gotten mine yet. 
Are they out?
as of the 18th yes :slightly_smiling_face: to managers
Yup
I think I have a 1 on 1 scheduled for Monday. Maybe my manager was waiting to give me mine then. 
i got a WHOPPING 2% raise :smile: i was rated 'highly effective' :facepalm:
that's a 2, right?
I think thats about all they can give you
also, that
That makes you an l3 or above
yeah i saw the algorithm- its pretty sad :confused:
it's just adjustment for inflation
You saw it?
wayfair has always been bad with off promotion raises
and barely that
I got nothing
but that's because of my recent raise
dang it!
it's one of the reasons you don't see many engineers stick around for very long
oh, for sure
dont get me wrong, im  very happy with my job and what I make (dont smite me, life)
supposedly, I'll get a compensation bump in the summer
which seems silly to me
as it assumes I'll be willing to stay nearly a year at the lower band of my position
once I'm up to speed and equal with my coworkers, that's when I feel the comp change should occur
So there is a fire alarm? People in Boylston just let me go up to 3, no notice. 
Booooo, boylston alarm
Lol
Yes we just kicked out
I saw the people milling about. I just assumed it was the claimants action thing. 
I passed a group of students on walkout just up the street. 
I like to think its for the area 51 raid
Sooooooooo dumb. 
Super valuable use of my time
The internet trolls should stay on the internet. They’re created a logistical nightmare for many small towns in the region. Even if no one shows up. 
you get paid either way. its wayfair's time.
Ohhhhh?
Because people were prepping for it?
yeah, the towns around area 51 are tiny
Yea, but it still annoys me
Town of 20 prepping for the invasion of 100!
or 10,000
it would take a small percentage of the people who said they were going to go to actually show up to overwhelm the local systems, waste, water, food, ambulance, police, etc.
well, next fire drill you can light a real fire
True
US military will handle all that
lol
nope
they don't cover interest in the military while its on non-military grounds
in fact they probably can't with congressional appropriations.
Just have to call in the AZ national guard then!
sounds like i chose a good day to work from home
found one of the words of the day
one of?
Probably wouldn't have affected you, sounds like it was only 222 berkley that was affected
"the boylston office." technically the 500 side had to leave as well
Nevada
Did they?
Couldn't tell through the horde
the whole floor is open. its not like 222 is going to catch fire and 500 is going to just be fine
Ehhhhh, Call in the AZ guard anyway, start a full on interstate war
at least this was true on floor 3. I don't know if anything happened for floors 9 and 10
Dakota find out from people what happened report back
I NEED TO KNO!
alarm went off, but nobody on 10 left
Ahhhh so the whole building evacuated
Interesting
they said that only 4 was evacuated
Umm don’t light a real fire please
I need you to keep your job
are you still stuck outside?
no
I don't know Mei.... lighting a real fire during a fire alarm sounds like the right thing to do
we've been in for a bit now
Yea
I have a fire drill for my building today too lol
It was pretty quick
That sucks
SOOOO MANY STAIRS
Our fire drill is literally find the staircase and don't go down it
then we get a lecture from a security expert contractor
and *don't* go down it?
yeah they are just testing you if you know where the door is
kind of easy since it is literally 5 feet from me :stuck_out_tongue:
they don't do like an end-to-end time?
nope
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL2-bO4py5M>
man what is it with UK people and escalating non-issues
They issued a report saying "X tool isn't working"
We respond saying "X tool is being deactivated, as it never worked well, and cannot be used anymore"
Them "THIS IS KILLING OUR WORKFLOW, YOU BETTER RECONSIDER"
Us: "The US has not had this tool for a year now with no complaints, but you can do Y to do the same work. We cannot make the tool work again"
Then they start pinging L6s
do we have people working in the UK? I know we have teams in Ireland and Germany...
customer service agents
didn't know that
They panic and HEAVILY escalate at the drop of a pin
its nuts
Then we get uninformed L6s panicking because some random UK people are blowing nonissues out of proportion
yeah there is warehouse in UK
i have always found the customer service agents have such high turnover rate so they don't really know too much about what they are doing
Yeah, it's just Cowboy Bebop that's hard to find without a paywall of some kind.
L6's freaking out because other people are freaking out annoy me
Huh, this thread has been a good reminder in why not to go back to Wayfair.
wat?
Yeah, I randomly get replaced by a scrambled bot
but also it posted twice?
and I can see the banned word?
(and I have no idea what you were trying to say)
"Huh, this thread has been a good reminder why not to go back to Wayfair"
ah
Everything about this is on point
I like scambled plus ban
It's way funnier looking
:bug:
Technically not a bug. Its two reactions to a single event, both of which end by posting a message
That's still a bug. Logical error vs syntactical
We'd have to rewrite a lot of code to make everything flow
We can put it under the high effort low reward part of the priority matrix
True dat
So it's logged, but no one will ever do anything about it until it pisses off an uninformed L6 enough to arbitrarily get assigned to a sprint
And then get tabeled after a sprint because the L6 is now more informed about why it was dumb to work on in the first place.
But the sprint was 2 months because Kanban
And then they'll form a committee to see if they should switch from Kanban to Scrum. To which they'll just decide to take their favorite parts of Scrum with out all the hours assignments.  
So still Kanban. But with more stand-ups.
Someone is feeling bitter today it feels like
But not the useful stand ups, just the ones where 10 people go in a circle say what they are working on and no one actually can pitch in, help, or even understand what is being worked on
Doesn't great comedy come from tragedy?
Guess it just comes off as bitter
Pretty sure it was comedy or tragedy?
Also missing tone and punchlines
Yeah, it is text after all.
But yeah, no one has funny jokes about everything going right in your life
Valid point
Unfortunately this is coming as a double whammy to those same L6s, since my team got nowhere close to meeting our Q3 goals
It's usually "Let me point out what is wrong in your life, by pointing out the ridiculousness of it"
I miss John Stewart
and dakota, oophhhh
This was because you guys switched priorities and lost a team member right?
its worse than that
Ohhhh.... that sounds ominous
There are 3 engineers on my team. Me, another internal transfer, and a new labs guy
the other internal dude 1 week into Q3 starts dissappearing like every other day for hours at a time
after a week or two of that, he announces that his wife is having a baby, and he will be in and out of the office randomly
Is this the same guy that took parental leave and then gave his 2 weeks when he got back?
Yea
And then didn't document shit?
Yeah, we've been down this road
eventually he goes on paternity leave
comes back
That was the "lost team member"
puts in his 2 weeks, and then uses his accrued vacation time
and then does nothing
THEN we find out a couple weeks after that, that our top level pm has been looking for other work for some time now
I like that Dakota ignored us and plowed ahead
and has basically been doing nothing...
HAHAHAHAHAHA
so then she puts in her 2 weeks
THAT'NEW!
AND STOPS SHOWING UP 3 DAYS LATER
New stuff!
THIS WAS A WEEK AND A HALF AGO
Soo basically Dakota's team = :dumpster-fire:
This is how Dakota gets a promotion to L4 before he's been at the company even 4 years.
and we find out that she hasn't been doing shit, and now we need to put together a Q4 presentation with a brand new top level PM who has no fuckin clue we existed and now has to ramp up on everythign we have done
That's how I got promoted to bartender: we lost all the other barbacks and bartenders.
Nah L4 too hard.
I'll probably stick as an L3 for a while and jump ship
:collapsing_thinking:
But "unlimited" vacay at L4
thats what Im thinking too.
unlimited vacation is a trap
Totally
But why jump ship if you don't want to be an L4?
Hence the quotes
Cuz shit raises
Haven't you hit peak of your career then?
LOL!
Valid
See, we're back at "reminder why I don't want to go back"
Oooh so you got upgraded to bar tending drew?
I've been bartending since July...where were you?
Being silly
that bot is great
yes
Fuck, "I've been bartending since July...where were you?"
so yeah thats my team right now. Fun stuff
:dumpster-fire:
Yeah, sounds like a total shit show
Weirdly I've never seen people in the corporate world with quite that disdain for leaving jobs without fulfilling the 2 weeks.
....what's the frequency of that bot at?
10%
should be like 1/10?
Is that the same as CJ emoji spam?
Those giantic text blocks you had ealier used up your luck
nah thats 1/50
I think emoji spam is lower
make drew's bot 1/20
I'd be frustrated with how often this has been happening were it me
yeah cant parse out that one
2 weeks, distain people for never leaving fulfilling jobs
Something along the lines of people giving 2 weeks for unfulfilling roles
ah that makes more sense
I'm just surprised this is happening in Wayfair so much. Didn't see that at any corporate job where people didn't really honor the 2 weeks
and the disdain you get for not doing that in corporate?
Meanwhile, I have to ask every time I come back from a week vacation who quit or got fired at the restaurant.
that's crazy
scrambler should be at 5% now
Though one server tried to put in her 2 weeks and got told no...and she stayed and extra 3 weeks before quitting in the middle of a double!
got told no?
....how does that even work
Right???
Someone thinks they can bully people into shit
at the end of two weeks, just leave
Till they decided to leave you in a worst place than if you had just accepted
you gave your two weeks
they can't choose to not accept it
I mean 2 weeks is just being nice, although execs typically give 1 month
I mean lets be clear, 2 weeks is so your boss and co-workers don't hate you.  It has nothing to do with the job
2 weeks is to not burn bridges
Yeah, well people burn a shit ton of bridges in the restaurant industry. Literally have had 4 different times where a bartender or barback quit mid shift and gotten left to the dogs as a result that shift.
that's unfortunate
is it because of poor management?
or impolite employees
I would imagine both, on top of poor pay
Both. I think the problems people have with our management are extremely on point. I also think these people are super impolite.
The poor pay is a weird one. You're technically correct, but not for the reasons you might think.
what are the reasons?
Tip split bad?
what sort of problems do employees have with management?
short staffing shifts to save money?
Basically. The only incentive a restaurant has to not overstaff is losing good staff due to poor split of tables, sections, tip pool, etc.
LOL
poor scheduling practices?
Well, we have one manager who's nice to guys...and an asshole to all the women. 
We have a regional director who just cares about the most minute details instead of how that affects the flow of the restaurant. 
Overstaffing. 
Shitty splits between servers and bar. 
Etc.
shitty splits in favor or servers or bar?
Our GM just started referring to one server as "Pamalama-ding-dong" and just hasn't stopped.
:wat:
what's her actual name?
Pamela
that sounds like my retail days
was gonna say, none of this surprises me
Oh no, not at all. The people quitting so often on the spot is the one thing that has me thrown off. The rest seems par for the course.
Even that. Service industry is where I would expect that to happen the most
The shitty tip split is when you have a party come in and do a cash bar. Tips are pooled between bar and servers assigned to party. 
It's a cash bar though, so 80% of the work is the bar making drinks, taking payment, clearing dishware, etc. The servers take the occasional order and pass food around. 
Each server gets 35%, the final 30% goes to the bar. Which gets split amongst the 2-4 people actually working the bar that day.
That is a shit decision, you did all the work and get none of the funds?
bartenders probably have higher base pay
Nope
interesting. I would have expected the servers to get paid way under minimum, so they gotta give a large percentage of tips to make sure they dont pay out of pocket for not hitting minimum
guess they just short everybody
at least you get to underreport your earnings
Not really. The tips on credit cards all get reported
oh, I read "cash bar" and thought "cash only at the bar"
so it is cash only?
your reaction confuses me
Sorry, it's just everyone pays for their own drinks. No actual cash has to be involved
oh that sucks.
so much for under reporting tips
This wasn't trying to be a complain about my job thread. Was just answering questions that came up.
didn't think you were complaining. this was a thread for ME to complain
And you certainly have a lot to be upset about!
Actually I am not upset at all. I am amused by the absurdity of it.
Yeah, you're kind of in a sweet spot where if they disolve the team they'll just transfer you. And if they don't, you're an engineer with a steady promotion history. Short of them committing bodily or mental harm to you, you're fine!
Asked my mama get, got to see it without waiting the weekend. Nice to finally see what my promotion raise was. 
Manager. 
:typing:
Talking forever
While we're in how different jobs are going, how's your "new" jobs been going <@UDD45P5A9>  and <@UDBV9N1E0>?
wait promotion?? you got promoted?
While we're in how jobs are going, how are your "new" jobs going <@UDD45P5A9> and <@UDBV9N1E0>?
Killlllllling it!
Yup. :)
ooooh congratulations!
I just it L3. 
are you L4 now? :open_mouth:
ah! big deal still!
that deja vu almost had me
I think it got drew
It did. No reaction emoji
Umm, my contract ends on Wed, so looking forward to being unemployed and searching again
Oh goodie...
Sorry to hear that!
it was on CJ's post before it got deleted and replaced by the bot
Next level stuff there
All good, it was my decision to not go full time at the end of my contract
Makes sense. If it isn't worth continuing, why do it? This seems like a pretty clean break too
Yeah, the contract has been great, but the job offered was different from what I've been doing and too much of a deviation from what I want to do
my job is pretty fun. just have everything blowing up half the time due to no fault of my team.
hubot decided he didn't like VPN. Emojis updating now
Awwww boooooo Victoria, I hope you find something good
I'm not worried, I'm currently abusing all my connections to find something good
NO TURTLES TODAY!
there is 1
NOO!!!!!!! I MISSED :hypereyes:
:zach-sleep: is my coworker who fell asleep during our retreat
Ummmmmm ok.....
what retreat/ why werent we invited?
Aysh, asking the hard hitting questions
comp intel retreat
you weren't invited because you're not part of the STO
Yes but what did you retreat from, our competitor?!!?!? YOU NEED HOLD THE LINE MAGGOT!!!!
We retreated from the mandatory hackathon
:smile: :smile: :smile:
'mandatory'
nice!
if you want a referral to Wayfair :finger-guns:
Tempting, but I escaped once and really don't want to go back
you laugh; I didn't find it amusing
though I did get a week of PTO out of it
so I suppose I shouldn't complain
you shouldnt complain.
:stuck_out_tongue:
But if you come back, you could escape again!
Seems silly to make it mandatory
*YOU WILL LIKE THIS YOU HAVE NO CHOICE*
I agree ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I could...but I'm not gonna
Furnishing your secret Canadian love pad?

Seriously though, those are some crazy numbers. like absolutely nothing there adds up.
Ummmm yea, I'm confused and concerned
plis do halp
No help only pain
can anyone tell me how that relates to the prompt I gave?
Ummmm.... no...... and..... soooo much wrong
oh, perhaps throw up?
I guess
yeah, I can't keep watching that
:del:
Just gonna leave until that goes from my screen
Need some r/eyebleach
what was the original prompt?
BOOOOOOO
no take only throw
try using quotes
didn't really help me find what I was looking for
but thanks for the attempt
take 3
take 4
three in a row, not bad
what is the percent for your dash bot? it happens a lot
10% supposedly
10%
thats a 1/1000 right there
though it really depends on how python seeds random. I would hope that the three calls to random returned different values
that's what I was referencing with that giphy search
I don't think there's a giphy of it
Lazy good morning!
Summon the Silent
Well that's realistically dark, what a great morning greeting
You can thank Doug
the sweet silence of mondays
It would be interesting to see the average post count over the course of a week
I was playing with hooking up prometheus with AWS to see what I could do there
never got further than creating the account, but it might be possible to do some cool stuff
a front-end config could be pretty cool as well
Wait what???
You mean getting Prometheus a real server to sit on?
can you AWS without paying?
seemed like the benefit of glitch was that it was free?
yeah, thats why giphy can trigger dejavu
it's free as long as you dont use it too much
oh wait i got tricked by dejavu
lol
Good to know
Yes, yes you did
you didn't see anything
I WILL LEAVE THIS MESSAGE AS A MARKER TO YOUR FOOLERY!
its like looking at a picture of Stalin
I SAW AND I SHALL REMEMBER
it can also be pulled by future dejavus
since deleting  a message does not delete it from history
True that
that seems ripe for abuse
if I were to create a thread with hundreds of message containing offensive sayings and then delete them, I could make :dejavu: quite the asshole
Yup
though there are currently 10k + lines in the history
so even a couple hundred would still be rare
18k infact
you would have to do it in this channel though, since each channel has its own DejaVu history
All I'd have to do is scroll way up, start a thread on an old comment, silence Chaos seed, and post lots of stuff in said thread
true
is it worth the effor tthough
in fact, old threads cannot trigger Chaos Seed, so you wouldn't even have to silence it
To do it manually? No
I mean you can always just go into Prometheus it's self and just add stuff
_if_ you can find the file
I mean I know how to do that
is quiet
Yup. 
Is late
Today was just a quiet day overall
Have a good story Aysh?
nope. i did eat a pint of the best ice cream ive had in a while. in pittsburgh ,
Good Morning <@UDC4QL95G> <@UETS9HTSS> <@UDC03KCGK> <@UDBV9N1E0> <@UDD45P5A9> <@UHQD9J1SL> <@UJTEHPEPL>
Because it was in Puppy pics this morning, our SKUs are also named, `Aggressive Dogs`
I feel like the person in charge of naming SKU's needs to be fired, and replaced with some sort of randomizer algo
lol, really? aggressive dogs
Yup
That’s a pretty bad name. 
This why we should have a walkout around the SKU namer!
That's where our real power lies!
They used to be named after marvel characters
You just need like 100 syllable sounds and randomly organize them
You'd sound sophisticated and probably not piss anyone off
But nooooooo.... We have to name them after trade mark things, employee names, and things that will get pet owners riled up!
So fun story, most skus are named by the offshore vendors and thus need guidance because English isn't their first language
That's my point, for a tech company you just make up some words and call it a day
Make it phonetically obvious and we don't need offshore anymore
SKUs are random and alphanumeric, right?
That's possible for naming, but offshore will always be needed
there is a 'formulaic naming' thing thats underway
A sku identifier is random and alphanumeric, but the descriptor for it needs to be real words
Eventually the computers will learn to do that too. 
Yea, but what i'm saying is we can do that now, they're just building some random ass word in front of a real descriptor.  At the point make it a truly random ass word and stop having people be annoyed at our naming convention
`IVYX2489` is the SKU identifier, `Kirtley Upholstered Standard Bed` is the name/description.  But if you notice the things people are complaining about is the `Kirtley` part of the description That's where our names are being used
You could just make `Kirtley` complete random gibberish and it would still accomplish the same thing
So the formulaic thing is being tested in EU, and the Kirtley thing is the collection which will be difficult to remove from all skus and I don't think would work as gibberish due to seo and branding needs
But to your point Victoria, we just create a randomizer branding creator, rather than employee name branding creator.  Maybe they're already doing that in the EU
I agree employee names shouldn't be used, but not sure how easy it'd be to create a generator
I think using last names is an easy way to make our in house products sound legit, since designers label their crap with their last names
And doesn't "Kirtley" sound like a designer bed :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://infohub.corp.wayfair.com/display/MPE/White+Label+FAQ> everything is renamed anyway
aww i cant see the white label faq :stuck_out_tongue:
haha so basically no matter what suppliersubmits, we rename and add it to our exclusive brands
Oh yeah for the old wayfair people, infohub has now replaced the KB
except it's worse
cuz the search functionality is garbage
though the ui is nicer
they claim its for a cohesive experience but its so that people cant use things like camelcamecamel to check prices on amazon
so did they transfer all the kB articles over?
yeah, but not all of them
activism is active
oh, looks like today is voting day for primaries for city council
active in a good way (drama) or a boring way
Boring way
I was disappointed
:sadpanda: Oh no i can't vote cuz i'm not registered
what a sad day
register to vote!
you've been in Boston for years now
I'm not registered to vote cuz I have no interest in voting
I am not at all well informed politically, so any voting I _would_ do would be effectively random
and I am not willing to dive into politics
I prefer to watch the world burn
actually the 'politics' channel is ok ok drama-ish active
unsurprising really with a the news coming out with more and more "impeach trump for X" every day
Person A:
Okay...take as much pleasure as you want, go to parties just to celebrate somebody getting shit for something they did, make it a public holiday if you will, but that is still not okay in my book

Person B:
Okay.
OH man, its been so too long. politics is really scratching that itch
I feel like you just need to watch Survivor or Real Housewives or something, get your fill of drama to consume.
Nah, I think its the fact that it is happening in a plublic space in the workplace that makes it enjoyable
How is rachel still employed?
Thanks for the heads up <@UHQD9J1SL> this was fun
is that dude's argument that schadenfreude is wrong?
jumped in in nonwork politics
to ask that question
I think his main problem was with people celebrating the dudes family "turning on him"
Since a family turning on one another due to their beliefs is not something to be celebrated
at least thats what I got from the argument
ayyy found the word of the day again
THIS is what politics is all about
I enjoyed that response to my question immensely
:smile: :smile: :smile:
hyped for terraforming mars though
:terraform: :mars:
Did we figure out exactly how we are going to play
not really
I assume draft, and hopefully quick
and is <@UDDE5960N> playing
good question
if so, he needs to be okay with the late train
the 10:30 I believe
Well I think we were leaning towards no draft to finish quicker
with possible 1 income in everything start to speed it up further
sounds powerful
but those were just options thrown out there
1 income everything is part of the base rules.
what if we just do 2 corporations insead?
I've done that once before
it was interesting
I would probably just do prelude over 2 corps
why?
also I don't have that
OH i didn't realize you didnt' have it
doug has it
not me
I thought you both had it
Train is 10pm, which means I need to be finishing around 9:45
Cuz I liked prelude, and they pretty much achieve the same goal
Last time we played you guys finished up and tallied after i left for the 10pm train
So I would definitely prefer something faster
on the games channel we talked about no draft.
that is the easiest way to speed it up
Yeah, we wouldn't be playing the same variant we played when you had to leave early
I'm okay trying out no draft
I've never done it before
Same
sounds good
technically no draft is the normal way to play the game
So do we want to do anything else to speed up the game?
With no draft, how long do we think the game will take?
you can start with production at 1 on everything and take out the corporat era cards
technically that is also base rules
I want a corporation!
I think drafting takes up a good deal of the time.
A second corporation?
corporate era cards are low cost small income cards
what are the corporate era cards?
they have a red mark
oh
interesting
I didn't like prelude
they tend to be like "+2 energy" things. the bread-and-butter cards without flashy effects
I felt like I didn't have enough time to get an engine online
too few generations
I'd consider it
I've played that way before. it certainly speeds things up
you can do the game in less than 2 hours
1 income on everything is just so powerful, since you have titanium and steel from the start
and everybody gets plants + heat + energy
I'd prefer not having 1 income on everything
my vote is 2 corps over that
its like +6 income to start, on top of faster forests, and passive heat
So my take away
&gt;no drafting
&gt;2 corps
&gt;corp era cards
and time to completion is ~2 hours?
No draft + Base income = &lt;2hours alone
but base income = too powerful
base starting income might also make sense without the drafting, since you have so much less control on what you're doing. you may just need the generalized economy or risk having cards that just don't mesh together.
hmmm makes sense
That was prelude with 5 people though right?
where generations are already greaty reduced naturally
:are_you_sure:
what does it say!
Not interested in 2 corps. Fine with picking your Corp as usual from a couple options. 
I'd go just no drafting. We already have 5 people and will thus speed things up considerably. 
1 to everything seems like a way to skew how we approach no drafting.
soooo tiny!
the context helped
:smile:
:slightly_smiling_face:
python question for you
regarding the last line
why loop?
wouldn't we break out of the loop the first time return gets run?
There's no loop here?
I would love to know the context on that one
Don't remember that at all
Are you straight Dakota?
Because your opinion on are words violence doesn't matter if you are
That was the context
Oh yeah!
Good times
I was just extra confused since I went by Cody most my life
Hmmmmmm, I can't imagine calling you cody
We should bring that back
Lol some people do accidentally
I can, we'd get the D names confused less
Call me Andrew, call Dakota "Cody", and then there's just Doug
there is one dude on my team that calls me cody since he knows other dakotas that go by cody, and he did on accident
Or Carleton. Spent most of high school going by Carleton
Every time
You can't add syllables if you want a name to stick
Well, it did...so not sure what to tell you
if you call someone by their last name in high school it sounds like you're about to tell them to run laps
Suicides for hockey
"Seriously, what the fuck are girly laps?"
it was my first exposure to that syntax
apparently it builds the list on the fly
OHHH you're taking about inside the return statement
Yea, that would return the list of `["responses"] in flatten(response_request.callback(response))`
Dunno what flatten does
or really what any of that gibberish mean
<https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7479061/Mom-claims-Ukrainian-daughter-9-adopted-really-22-year-old-dwarfism.html>
ummmmm
That's dark
that article keeps flip flopping
how old was she?
She was either 8 or 22 when "abandoned"
Either way, the situation is messed up
You will be happy to know that my team situation as gotten even weirder!
My last remaining PM is now dedicating 50% of her time to another team.
my only PM does that.
but our team isn't as weird, so it works out
My team no longer has any full time people on the team
yeah, that's weird
I am givin 50% to my account, The labs guy is giving 50-70% to a team that doesn't even exist, and my pm is giving 50% to an App team
does 50% to a team that doesn't exist just mean loafing around?
its a good euphamism
No, it is work for a dissolved team that was never taken over by anybody
like it it ownerless code, but I am most familiar with it, so whatever team I am on gets the work
Your team is just "Miscellaneous"
Pretty much.
"what the fuck is this code?"
'Just give it to the Misc team'
feel bad for the labs guy though. Misc teams aren't the easiest to ramp up on, but at the end you become a source of knowlege of many useless things
You will be happy to know that my team situation as gotten even weirder!
and a lack of a rigid process isn't bad imo
I would stress "imo"
Personally I find process and structure helpful for ramping up quickly
I prefer being thrown into the deep end while everything is one fire
Need a perspective check: I got a drink onto the menu at Park that I had originally wanted to call "The Torched Imp" because it was a smokier and spicier play on a drink called an "El Diablo."
Both Sam and the person who had final say on the menu thought that "imp" wasn't a good word to use because it is derogatory, both citing Game of Thrones (a la Tyrion Lannister).
But I thought that was the whole point of it being an insult in GoT because it was a fantasy novel, harkening to imps in DnD, Warcraft, demons, and other fantasy tropes. I've heard little people be called things like "dwarves" before and how that is obviously in fantasy. Obviously other terms for little people that are offensive. Has anyone heard of other media or people using "imp" as a derogatory term outside Game of Thrones?
not personally, but if two people said it, then I might not release it to the world
The Torched Goblin?
That would have been a good way to keep the name. They instead went for "Diablo Picante" which works. I'm just curious on the offensive part of the dialogue. Is this a real offensive term, or just perceived offensiveness when the term has no history or use outside of a single popular fantasy series?
its certainly possible that GoT made it real. Nimrod wasn't an insult until Bugs Bunny said it to Elmer Fudd
Its a reference to a biblical hunter, but the kids didn't realize it
That's a fun bit of trivia. Is nimrod straight up derogatory though? It's an insult sure, but I always put it in the same category as calling someone an idiot
just an insult. the point was more that fake insults become real ones
Yeah I would see it as an insult, but not to the point of not being PC
"Diablo Picante" sounds like a salsa
like a good salsa, but still a salsa
Yeah, wasn't my name. This same bartender also called a drink "Tequila por mi amante" and Sam instantly went "shouldn't it be 'para?'" 
Had a whole discussion with the bartender from Ecuador and he basically had a long winded way of saying it could be 'por' but it meant something weirdly different than what the original name was supposed to mean.
Note: the bartender who was making all these decisions is not the one from Ecuador
As someone who hasn't watched got , imp sounds cute to me, like a malicious pixie
malicious pixies are not cute, they're scary
they can cast polymorph
Lol but they're also calling a drink that, not a person. I don't think it's offensive.
I agree
but Karen might not
I'd defer to the path of least liability.
Torched Goblin wins
Doesn't sound like salsa, and isn't taken as a newly offensive term
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UK7V13DS7> has more answers like that if you want them
<@UDC4QL95G> hope you didn’t get too burn
So enjoyed TM despite the lack of drafting. Still very fun, just feels like Sealed instead of Draft which in non MTG terms simply means a little more luck of the draw based and less manipulative than draft. 
Sherriff is always great, full or shortened, after drinking. 
Bloodborn is an easy fun game to pick up at the end of a game night. Would play again
After thinking about it, I think the only reason I won TM was because my economy was so much greater, I was 1 MC away from playing over 80 MC in the last round. Steel, Titanium, MC feed into your ability to produce more stuff
Where as plants are only ever useful for VP
yep, that certainly helps
granted, I wasn't far behind and I only had 20-23 income the whole game
and 1 steel income at most
Ohhh I totally expected you to win, I was trying to figure how I won without feeling in the lead
And the only conclusion i could come up with is because I had a little bit of everything being powered by my ability to turn out a lot of stuff
GOOD MORNING!
Reading rules of Blood Rage: the round ends when all the villages have been pillaged, regardless of remaining rage
Interesting. does Yaggdrasil count?
It's a remaining province, so yes
Good Morning!
CJ's bonus strength to his warriors also meant he had to pay 2 per warrior instead of 1
WHAT!?!?!?
That's a total ripoff
By upgrade we mean fuck you
Well you do get one free invade of a warrior when you play this upgrade
Also can confirm that if you pillage a province with a blue axes upgrade, you get the bonus to your glory before you actually calculate the glory for winning that battle.
Is that how the card read?
ending the round when people still have rage is a crazy twist.
I thought it was more along the lines of "your warriors count as 2 power each"
power and cost are the same thing usually
It's how it says it in the rules. You pay for their strength and calls out a warrior upgrade specifically for that situation.
Ah interesting
How does that not make the 2 warriors have bonus strength not strictly better?
I don't think that card exists in that reading.
you gotta have 2 warriors on the field. There aren't necessarliy enough slots on the region for 2 warriors
Still feels more powerful from a rage utilization stand point
Plus you can be blocked by people invading from adjacent regions
Though that card pairs well with the one that gives you a free invade every time you invade with a figure.
Read the rest of the rules. It doesn't say anything different about winners lose their cards while losers keep theirs, and you can keep a card age to age.
Additionally, it does call out how winning battles can be a path to victory, but so can being a suicidal clan. Even points out the card advantage as part of the suicidal route benefit.
So I still think you have to very deliberately make sure the Loki player is neutered wherever possible. Destroying Loki's Trickery any chance you can, and hate drafting Loki upgrades when you see them
Or we need to make some Homebrew rules to balance the game for future play throughs.
But does it call the cards I need to win by murdering fools?
No
Exactly because it's a shit strategy and they want you to think differently!
:tinfoil_hat:
No there's no turtles!
Now's there's no turtles!
Man, I feel like emoji enthusiasts stepped up their game the last few months to make way more emojis per day than they used to when I was there
But there are turtles
OH GOD DAMN IT!
How did you miss them this time?
I think posting each day's emojis encourages people to post more
You've created a monster
But like, Frankenstein's monster, who has a heart of gold, and really it is frankenstein who is the real monster
...so you're a monster, Dakota?
Next I just gotta start posting emoji highscores
that'll really get'em going
Do it!
It was brought up in the past, however I think people said no. It would encourage people to spam out poorly made emojis to get their numbers higher
Hmmm though It would be pretty funny to crown an "emoji king" as the person with the most emojis
Add it to the top of the post along with their emoji count
Silly people don't want the emoji floodgates to open
WE COULD HAVE SO MANY MORE EMOJI'S!
cuz 21317
It's never enough Dakota

Good news, a major spam detecting company has blacklisted wayfair IPs due to too many reports of spam from our emails
We are now getting a good deal of our outgoing emails bounced back!
LOL
Hola :)
Wow, you guys have finally made it. You're in the same ranks as GymIt
Turns out, we basically can't send an email to anybody with a microsoft email address
hotmail, outlook etc
HAHAHAHAHAH
There was an integration a while ago that didn't want emails, but it was difficult to suppress sending them, so their suggestion was to purposely send to a fake email they knew would bounce. We had to stop this plan a while because we knew it would make wayfair look spammy.
LOL!
We should totally look like an illegitimate company so we get caught in spam filters, this couldn't possible go wrong!
Summon the Silent
Lazy good Morning!
Summon the Silent
Hm, clearly I missed a space. 
lol
I really like Drew's
Good morning :wave:
There is a little pronoun confusion. I’m going to try and take a crack at that next. 
what?
uhh
where is the pronoun confusion?
It’s most obvious in Dakota’s. 
Dakota's what?
I lack any context
the SoS messages above
oh
ah
that makes infinitely more sense now
we you you them me
I think it makes the through-line harder to parse
but its my fault anyway, since I was trying to find new ground in these fragments.
Doug is really into the `Summon the Silent`
although this may very well be my favorite line of code I've ever written:
`creepyNouns, creepyFacts, creepyActs, creepyEnds = event_constants.STATEMENT_GENERATOR`
lol
at its core you're talking about the intersection of natural language and programmatic. Its a really cool problem space that in other contexts people are throwing a ton of money at right now. this is a very simple introduction into the field, of course, but still has a lot of possibility.
True, my favorite though is vectorization of the problem cause it's just a neat and novel idea
DAMN IT I DON"T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT I SAID!!!
I don't think this application is complicated enough to benefit from vectorization yet. If we had a firm feedback method, then possibly.
True, i was just saying for NLP I always thought that was the best way.  Requires a ton of data though
Howdy
Glad to see the emoji isn't ruined by the underscore replacement bot
You could have it scan a Lovecraft corpus or something, but even creepy books have plenty of sentences like "he walked into a bar". I know Amazon has been playing around with emotion identification from text. I wonder if they've looked into 'creepy'
oh, its not a space issue, Drew got two ends instead of one. weird.
ah, missing commas. python is annoying.
I just didn't realize you could Summon the Silent in the main channel body
I didn't think you could either
Howdy 
Howdy 
you can say that again
hmmm did default profile pictures change, or did you change yours?
We playing chess with emoji?
Seems inefficient
you could build it into prometheus.
Oh, you know what you could
I'm just not that desperate for that functionality. Would be much easier for us to just sign up for a chess site
easier? yes. better? yes. faster? yes. more powerful? yes.
...but could use it for making Penultima
That's weird.
Moving on, could make a Penultima simulator where you can upload a rules set and thus the slack channel would tell you if your move is legal or not and then you wouldn't need a judge
Found a python project for me!
Also fantastic we get :hiei_glare:
:yusuke_power: is the only other one? Weird. You'd think we'd have a Kurama or Kuabara one
I used to have a torical checkers sim on the web, but I'm pretty sure that domain lapsed a while ago.
I had to write a chess game for a project class in college. I used those same assets for my pieces
I see this in the emoji channel, and I'm trying to figure out if i should tell them about
<https://flame-mine.glitch.me/mega/`[[INSERT> PARTIAL GIGA EMOJI NAME HERE]]`
eg: <https://flame-mine.glitch.me/mega/depresso>
Can you give Wayfair people the power of Prometheus?
Give fire to man
security will not be thrilled
Security doesn't need to know Doug
they control slack integrations
Ohhh I thought Dakota was just going to give them a website that gave them their emoji back in correct text
We'll never get them to allow us to integrate :disappointed:
oh, then sure, nevermind
Yeah, I was talking about the link to the site. Security doesn't like any integrations that need to listen for an action
Good morning peoples!
Summon the Silent
Prometheus wakes up slow
At least it’s working. I accidentally took it down for like an hour yesterday. 
:wave:
lol
did slack update?
No.....?
I"m seeing sidebar font changes
and missing characters
and bold channel names
when unread
that makes the text much wider
Wheres you # why do you have weird little boxes?
The bold Channels names have always been around
See NORMAL
it was a bug
Ctrl+R fixed it
hah; two bot responses
Booooo we're not suppose to have the same word back to back days
So no update just broken

I was seriously on the struggle bus this morning
I think I had a mild case of the spins at like 4:30am
how come
better now?
Thursday was beer night wasn't it?
Brenden drank a lot of alcohol last night
yeah, last night was monthly beer night
I got home around 9:30pm, ate something quickly, and passed out
Sooo beer drinking for 4ish hours with no food
forgot to chug a glass of water and take an ibuprofen
Can't say I'm suprised
I went to Boda Borg yesterday. We spent like 30 minutes figuring out a quest, then right before we do out final run, guy in front of us bloodies his face in the room, so they had to close it for cleaning.
:open_mouth:
oh no!
what quest was it?

oh yes, love that one

There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing

Is it raining, is it snowing
Is a hurricane a-blowing

Not a speck of light is showing
So the danger must be growing
Are the fires of Hell a-glowing
Is the grisly reaper mowing

Yes, the danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
And they're certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing

Im moving apartments today/ tomorrow and the electric company's website is messed up and they have had me on hold for an hour too
that's awful
it issssssssss
What god did you piss off in a previous life
this life. My Mom.
HAHAHA
you mom curses phone calls? That's pretty awesome. Mine can't do that
you just dont know. All Moms are angry Goddesses.
No her mom brings down electric companies when she's trying to move places
WAY MORE POWERFUL than a simple phone call
SORTED!
WOOT!
You'll have lights tonight!
So what do you all thing of all the crap that has been going on with trump lately?
Someone wants to get a spicy conversation going. 
Are we talking about the civil war stuff?
Politics is being too normal about it
lol
i was talking about constant "OMG trump did X" stories that have been coming out over the last 2 weeks
of which the civil war was one of the latest
Isn't that like everything that's been going on since he took office
Every week is some sort of new outrage (most of which are justifiable)
True, but these weeks seem like they are actually gonna do some damage
I feel like we're approaching the culmination of lots of stuff
But I mean the whistle blower and Civil war tweet are edging out of, shenanigans and into the realm of stupid Hitler
what hurts is that I can't rule out this leak being intentional just so that trump can call it a witch hunt to help himself in the next election
it seems too smart, but a lot of his managing of the media has been stupid, but also smart in some weird way
I mean the American Monarchy stuff is getting concerning to me
I mean I agree with the people that Trump is nothing but the puppet that everyone is watching.  The hand up his ass is the scary part
And is it the true world elite, or just putins
Wait, so is the general consensus that trump is being controlled?
Never actually got that impression
Did you ever see Die Hard with a Vengance?
I've never heard that until CJ just said it
but I also don't follow this kind of stuff very closely
I.... don't know what to think about this
You guys have at least heard Moscow Mitch right?
I consume too much news as it is. Looks like I’m not going to be able to disconnect while on vacation. 
Ohhhhh why?
Because more exciting things are happening in the news. 
I mean it's just been building and building
That’s not really how it’s felt to me. 
It has seemed pretty static for a while. 
Really? The impeachment drum has been beaten for a while
They just finally acted on it
Not in a way I considered serious. Especially once the primary started there was a real chance that things in general would just fizzle down for a long period. 

Even now all the Russia stuff has pretty much been dropped. 
USA today has an article speculating that trump is desperate for a 2nd term so that the statute of limitations will pass for many of the crimes he committed early on
I’d call that too cute by half. You don’t need a reason to be desperate for a second term. 
Beyond the normal reasons. 
You say this like he's going to stop doing dumb stuff that will start new inquiries
I'm with doug he wants a second to keep doing more of this shit
Although, that is a big part of why Julius Caesar took the steps he did. He was constantly on the hook for criminal charges if he left office. 
Good Morning Everyone!
Summon the Silent
Good morning! I have almost finished moving apartments!
yay
moving sucks.
WOOOOOOO!!!!
And the lights are on?
yes!
#winning!
Mine's short, but sobering
either doug has invented some mechanism to make some parts more likely to join, or the increased pool has higher quality parts that just seem to flow better
Yeah moving is just never ideal. You find all this crap you should get rid of, but more often you take care of throwing it away after you've moved it with you than before it goes into a box :(
Word of the day is the same?
it
Yup
it
There are 2 words of the day, I think only one has duplicate prevention
Mine
I don't know what to think of the latest. There's definitely a real fatigue after all the things he could've been impeached for have been brushed aside time and again. The latest doesn't even feel any more blatant.
I think doug has just been playing with it
:ghostbusters:
I contributed :cursed-hamburger-helper:
It's so quiet today
busy busy
Got to airport early. People weren’t there yet to check bags, so I’ve been sitting on the airport floor. 
What airport did you go to? Logan has people like 24/7
Not TAP Air Portugal. 
They.... are not the most organized airline. 
Apparently
They might not have flights in the afternoon today, so they let the front desk leave. 
Soooo... uhhh what flight are you waiting for?
Doesn’t take off until 6:20, so I know I am pretty early. 
Oh, baggage people showed up. 
So like no flights between 12 and 6 and they send everyone home
suspicious!
Maybe they only have like two flights a day from Logan or some other small number. 
interesting, I wouldn't say that you're pretty early for an international flight
They say arrive 2 hours priop
so you're a little early!
It’s in the domestic terminal
Really????
WHERE ARE YOU GOING!?!?!?
Yup. 
Direct flight is Lisbon. 
Why is a direct flight to Lisbon in domestic? :exploding_head:
There are a coupe airlines that do their international out of the domestic. It’s weird. 
Like how there is actually a US immigration station in the Dublin airport, so technically flying from Dublin to Boston is like a domestic flight, security-wise. 
And then when you land you immigrate then?
I DON"T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS!?!?!? I've never gotten to fly domestically when I land on a different continent.  They always make me do that shit here
I did that flying from dublin as well
I basically went through customs and whatnot while in ireland
I had brought a large, hefty shoe horn in my bags that in hindsight could probably been used as a bludgeoning weapon
and they pulled it out of my bag and looked at me like "what the hell is this?"
the fact that the handle was wrapped in paracord didn't help
You brought a shoe horn? You must have fancy shoes. 
I was breaking in red wings
which was a mistake to do on vacation
alternately, I dislike using my fingers to wedge my feet into my shoes
lol!
Well, breaking in shoe's on vacation sounds like blisters to me
And I can't get out of my head a thug like Brenden with a billy club
preferably improvised
do I get proficiency?
Yes but only +2 because he's level 1
Also Variant human with `Tavern Brawler`
well that would be the only way a level one character gets proficiency with an improvised weapon, so that makes sense
Good Morning Monkeys!
Summon the silent
:party_poop:
Summon the silent
black helicopters still seem out of place
what are the chances of that?
Not a clue
not I just want to see how far I can take it
You're triggering everything
I'll count that
oh well, it's over now
By the way to follow up with you fools, the accepted narrative is that Russia actively was involved in the 2016 election and they were backing Trump
that part I was aware of
this is getting ridiculous
did someone program a higher probability when I post?
So there's pretty much 2 logical conclusions:
Either Russia thought trump would be a destabilizing force
or
Putin has his hand so far up Trump's ass Putin uses Trump like a sock puppet
Nope
You're just lucky today
The later is more likely given the Russian connections that conservatives have
Especially given their complicit backing of this nonsense
lol
hmmm banned word still hasn't changed
Ban word is broken
turns out copy-pasting emojis doesn't do well
????
the emojis dont actually copy over
yeah, it just copies the text
I should buy a lottery ticket today
I feel like I should split a ticket with you
Only 60 mill, not enough for a good pool split
i think i heard about that
they had amazing engineering
Or... they were aliens
Yea, a lot of European stuff had hot water heating
Yeah, it's why I'm so weirded out that this is the thing finally sticking, because the Russia stuff has already been laboriously spelled out in investigations and Mueller's report. Why is this suddenly what gets people stirred to action? Upcoming election interference is more legitimate than previous election interference? My impression is that is what Watergate was about, what Nixon did about the election he had won. Why is Trump different?
Does this effect the import from Jenkins at all?
Why are we talking about European stuff
Is there supposed to be a picture of him in the background in the original clip?
It's meta
Romans having heated floors
Because Doug is European
Summon the silent
Summon the silent
Wow... mine is dark
I don't ever remember that convo
Why does prometheus keep pinging in channel. That was a script i posted a while back for doug and brenden that would automatically open up Push Requests based on the git branch they were currently on
dejavu splits via newline characters, so any multi-line posts get counted as individual lines
why does summon the silent keep posting in channel?
Are you seeing something different than I am?
I only see those as threads
I kinda wanna change `You witness the sunset` to `The sun has set`
WTF Mate
I agree with this sounds better
but, it's not even a copy of the one in the thread, its a whole new set of phrases, and ther eis an extra person
HOLY SHIT!
You're getting an individualized posting of this?
<@UETS9HTSS> Who's copy of slack do you see?
I only see the thread
So basically Dakota, Prometheus is sending you a specialized message, and probably only you
Ctrl + R
I’ve been seeing SoS in the channel as well.
Talk about a bug
but on whose side?
Slack or us?
I’m pretty sure my messing with SoS should only have changed the text, not the event itself. 
Dunno, I'm guessing Prometheus, on the plus side, if we figure out how to exploit this, we can make Prometheus send messages that only some of us can see like you originally wanted Brenden
Oh man, this is going to get so confusing if we all see different slack histories. 
:chaos:
Wait, I'm confused is everyone not seeing the double summon messages?
Alright, I guess brenden and I are in the miniority
3 for double 2 for threaded
NO TURTLES TODAY!!!
also i'm concerned about the :quagmire:
:he-bring-you-a-sad:
I'm ok with mine. Cheers!
I see double posting
:he-bring-you-mixed-feelings:
how many times did you look over the list to confirm
Uhhhhh 6 but it's a short list
Sooo basically the people most likely to call it are also the people who don't see a double posting
how... fortuitous for us
I'm enjoying the free booze in an airport lounge this afternoon
Why don't i get free booze?
How... suspicious for us. 
I think I get a guest with my priority pass
Come join until 3:30
I WILL TAKE MY COMPLIMENT THAT I DID THIS SOME HOW!!!
Stupid meetings getting in the way of free drinking
I’m eating Wiener schnitzel right now. 
summon the silent
Yea I still see doug as the last message
I only see it in thread this time. 
Yeah there was a bug in the code, honestly not sure how it was working
You know what's really funny, I'm not even getting the pings Prometheus is sending out
cj is this not what you see?
I see it in the thread
yeah it is only in the thread thist ime
Ahhhh ok
now to figure out why bans are not resetting
it
alright expiration logic still works
You know you know a bartender who can hook you up with free drinking right?
True, but I'm being lazy
You'd go to the airport as easier than Harvard Sq.?
Getting booze from you is too "normal". It's the unusual cirmstances of getting free drinks at the airport that make it appealing!
Don’t you have to go through security to get to the lounge?
Maybe CJ likes the TSA. 
I was more thinking of the times Mei made me fly and I never go free booze, than today I want free booze
FOUND THE NEW WORD!
Wasn't hard
I I I I I
:bug:
The banned word is usually quite common. Have you ever gone a workday without finding it?
Yeah actually
The bug though is in reference to how it still shows my original message in addition to the redacted one
Words that are used a lot are statistically more likely to be picked, as it uses the channel's entire history to pick a word
kinda interesting
UDC4QL9SG?
Likely a user id of some sort
@UDC4QL9SG
Also props to <@UHQD9J1SL> for being the only person who's name gets said as frequently as the 3 people who started this slack
Thanks..I love praise.
UDC4QL9SG is in fact ME
I'm sad that we use "lol" so much
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UDC03KCGK> 
That isn’t mana!
lol
That’s the untapped symbol. 
Which is often written q, so that’s right at least. 
that means it is wrong in wayfair as well
:mana-q:
Weird, I don't see that symbol much. Usually just the tap symbol
A curse upon your house!
It was only in one block. 
I think Shadowmoor 
Will it read from snippets? Can I make a snippet of the same word 100k times and affect the odds?
Not sure if that will be applied as text or an attachment in the event
I assume it will not
though you could just do somethign like:

stupid
stupid
stupid
stupid
stupid

and now stupid is much more likely, since it splits on newlines
I was trying to think of a way without polluting main chat. 
a single thread should do it.
just type: `Silence Chaos Seed` in the thread to avoid pinging other people
you will get a :salute_cap: reacji if it successfully silence the thread notifier
Two thoughts on why this is different. 1) Russia could like sore loserdom because it looked backward. Ukraine is about securing the 2020 election. 2) the Russia investigation never proved Trump directly talked to a foreign leader about an election. Ukraine *starts* with that. And it’s not contested, the White House admits it. So it’s less about fact finding. 
who's a good boy??????????????? YOU ARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wat?

The Ash bot broke again
Who you calling broke, chum?
Unrelated, I managed to pick up a what seems to be an unused copy of Carcasonne yesterday for $3 at goodwill
The tiles haven't even been popped out of the cardboard yet
Woah
A steal
The store is on my way home from work, so I typically stop in to see if there are any new boardgames or other cool stuff
First time I found anything so far
So we’re just glossing over Aysh’s madness?
Don't we always?
I'm with Drew, I've given up trying to understand her entirely
She's the Chaos Goddess
Goodwill should bottle the scent of their stores and sell them
its smells like grandmas
I am a big fan of goodwill. Mostly cuz they don't look up the value of ANYHTING they sell
they just wing it
Good Morning!
Summon the Silent
Hey no double post!
Did you change something or did we just get lucky?
He changed something
the `messageIsPartOfaThread(data)` before the call to summon the silent was missing the `(data)` part.
Ah
I have no idea how it worked to begin with, but it seemed to post twice rather than erroring out
thanks programming
Part of why I want us to upgrade to python3, it has good type hinting to catch that kind of stuff. 
I haven't used python enough to really know the difference.
I know my import emoji job is python3 and thats about it
<https://imgur.com/gallery/nDSWamg>
<https://giphy.com/gifs/baby-gollum-vCtGKpWr1jGhy>
I was just excited that Dakota got us python cause he was using JS (I think)
Yup, original bot was node js.
I actually like node js 
I spun up the python one just for cj to play with
Too much effort to learn a new syntax
<https://glitch.com/edit/#!/join/04c45f39-024f-49a5-9312-4ac4fd266d79>
Also I like writing pseudo code and just having it magically work
Node JS server if you care
this one is HORRIBLY written. it was abandoned as soon as the python server went up
Its.... even more chaotic than Prometheus
I have also added you as a collaborator in both slack apps over at:
<https://games-club-external.slack.com/apps>

if you want to add additional slash commands and stuff
You say this like I know what that even means
It's basically all the place where I linked the servers to slack
all the config and tokens and crap
`i did this`  and `was that me` are the same :confused:

This chat is slowly becoming a home of all the HR'd wayfair emojis
they will not be forgotten
:feelsgoodmann: :sillypepe:
the aliases do not update if they are deleted in wayfair
Interesting
That is interesting. Would not want to see them survive, but I don't also anticipate it really mattering
Correct me If I am wrong, but I do not see any of us complaining about a few `:pepe:` emojis.
I can (or most of actually) can remove them if anybody prefers
Symbols are symbols, gay use to mean happy, the swastika use to be good luck.  These things evolve over time
Prometheus thinks you are implying somebody <@UDDE5960N>
What was the one that 4chan turned into white supremacy to see if it could?
LOL!
I think that was :ok_hand:
I don't like them and what they've come to represent. I feel bad for the original artist watching their work get turned into this symbol, but what can you do
I mean I'm with Drew, but I'm also of the opinion that banning things just makes it go underground
A clear example is all the white supremacy rhetoric we hear now.  It was always there, we just tried to suppress it.  Well ladies and gentlemen this is what you get
So what should have been done differently in your opinion?
Ohhhh I totally think you should allow them out in the open.  No one shows up the new generation starts asking questions around why no else cares
People should just care less
If you hide it, then you make it a pressure cooker
These things wilt in the sun, and thrive in the dark.  Forcing it into darkness is the best thing you can do for it
Racism tends to fester in places where you don't get exposure. The more exposure the better it is in the long run.  Is it painful in the short term, sure you have to deal with dumb ass racists
I'm also of the opinion that for the US to continue as is, we need to figure out a way to remove the republican party and replace it with something more... Patriotic
:lol:
you and the rest of the internet
Yea, but the rest of the internet wants the secede.  Which I will vehemently argue is the lazy short term answer.
Those people need to do a little history lesson around "There will be peace in my time"

There is a good chance. Nobody has left let, though I am tempted to duck out early

whats wrong with the pepe emoji?
not asking rhetorically, i am just unaware
He's an alt right mascot now a days
Very heavily used in the 2016 elections by the MAGA crowd
um- thats appropriation :confused:
Correct!
How did SV go today?
we only played on round . i figured out who was who but no one believed me :confused:
Bummer did you lose because of it?
no but were in the last round
it was ok ok
well that's good
Winning despite the frustration
Tagline for my life? :stuck_out_tongue:
not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing
What are games good for ~8 people who don't really play board games.
All I have currently are SV, Avalon, Spyfall, Decrypto, Codenames
Those things pretty much
why?
<@UDC4QL95G> what's going on?

Too bad I have it already. I'll donate it to the games club or something
Donate it to me!!!
Which goodwill are you finding this gold in?
Podcast?
Yeah. There is an arc where the city is getting consumed by evil and the hallmark of the coming evil is the question “who’s a good boy“. It’s pretty unsettling. That’s what your comment made me think of. 
Excellent....

OMG I HATE LIZARDS
HAHAHAHAHA
Ayshu, how do you feel about legged snakes?
I had a nightmare as a child. A lone barbie doll sits at the top of the staircase in my paternal grandfathers home. I am at the bottom, looking up at it. Slowly, its head tilts to the side. Out  of its neck, a swarm of a 100 lizards crawls out towards me.
I HATE LIZARDS
you mean dinosaurs?
That is an oddly specific dream Aysh
I'm thinking crocs or alligators personally
i grew up with house lizards as normal pets at home
That is a horrible nightmare
Alright, now I'm more confused not less.  You grew up with them as pets, and you still hate them?
ugh i meant PESTS
Ahhhh, this makes more sense. Lizards don't do well here so that's less of a problem
Good morning, from the bottom of my heart :heart:
just google indian house lizards
theyre the same color as human (indian human) flesh and sort of translucent so you can also see kinda through them (especially when the crawl over light fixtures)
and they move so weird
Good morning from my own apartment!
So ended up playing Hyperborea yesterday, which was a game that felt like a cross between 7 wonders, Lorenzo, and Civilization
Felt like there were a lot of ways to play it, and I'd be interested to see all the different strategies people could develop
I have a suspicion that it is going to end up being a game like tzolkin where there are lots of things you can do, but only so many of them actually get you enough points to be competative
Aww 
I like all three of those things. Putting all three together sounds like it could be complicated. 
Unrelated, I need an eye exam, anybody have a place they would recommend?
No, so I'm going to listen in on what other people recommend you
<@UK7V13DS7> this is your area of expertise
preferably somewhere in the city
Well, it is quite literally complicated, but not difficult. Just a lot of interlocking pieces
Maybe sub out Lorenzo for Azul. You couldn't pre plan subsequent turns with much certainty because there is a bag mechanic, and a probability of not drawing what you needed or wanted.

btw
just got Capitan Sonar for $10
<https://www.target.com/pl/364322228?facetedValue=m4r0p>
also this. Spend $100, get $25 off
Captain Sonar was well worth the time. Hard to get a group together, but considering you need 8 player games for Fridays, that's a good one
I don't even seen captain sonar
I may have picked up the last copy
It's just labeled "Sonar" on page 2
Would anyone be interested in Axis and Allies Zombies?
The original axis and allies is great, I don’t know why you need zombies. 
:moneybag:
Because zombies????
This saids 2 to 4 where'da get 8?
WTF????
Nevermind the old game required 8
Lol I went in looking for drama, I think this tweet is better
`in my great and unmatched wisdom`
The language is crazy, but it’s actually one of the few times he’s show any consideration for the Syrian Kurds. 
I mean..... that language is the definition of insane
I assume this is about the upcoming Turkish military action in Syria. 
Stable genius. 
I mean that basically throws shade at all of our european allies
Yes. 
Bonus is he's destroyed economies before? HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT?!?!
And Turkey is in NATO. 
:facepalm:
destroy AND obliterate
Don't we have like nukes and stuff there?
Also I've never played the original A&amp;A
I haven’t played since Boy Scouts, so it’s possible my opinion is just nostalgia. 
that was an ACTUAL tweet? this is pompous even for him
I don’t know about nukes, but there are US missiles in turkey. 
But yeah, there’s an impressive number of things wrong with this. It’s basically poetry how dense the meaning is. 
This a different game then?
Sounds like a simpler version of the game
This is just off the chain crazy now. Said that about a lot of things in the past now, so who knows what will actually happen
Shame, I really liked the 8 person version. Curious as to how this one works
Why do you need 8 people to shoot torpedos at each other!?!?1
Eventually WW3 has to occur
Well, now McConnell is telling Trump not to leave Syria, so that complicated things. 
Man... I'm sad I know who that is...
HAHAHAHA
I have been far to invested in all this trump hate
Dakota is learning political just to follow the insanity
This is like, not normal political insanity right?
Knowing the Senate leader is a reasonable thing, even in non drama years. 
what emojis are those?
ds-yay ds-meh
something like that
No this not normal, although we could be seeing the start of something new
Something that'll probably only end in bloodshed
history being made before our eyes
Quite possible
not for somebody who often doesn't know the vice president
Generally I could name my senators, and Pres/VP
Never was good at tracking Senate/House
I have never known the name of a single one of my senators
nor the senate leader
nor the speaker
I typically draw the line at the president
I would never pass the citizenship test
Clinton Gore/Bush.... Chenney?/Obama Biden/Trump Pence
Also I would really prefer for it not to be made before our eyes, it tends to be messy
Good Morning!
Summon the Silent
Today's are basically
Brenden = Anti-Christ
Dakota = Insane
I kinda like it
Good morning!
Good morning~! Today is the day of a Hindu festival  where we pray to the Goddess of Learning.
We would leave all our books as an offering for a whole 3 days and just not study or do any homework the whole time.
my mom wanted me to do it with my laptop this year....how I wish.
Good morning; I'm on ops/criticals this week and next, so I'll be quiet here as I have no idea what I'm doing :finedog:
that means you need to spend more time here panicking about not knowing anything
These are flowing suspiciously well
:circus-peanut-explosion: is oddly specific
Those are nasty
They really are. Candy corn isn't my thing but I at least see the appeal
really
definitely
trully
ah ok
Can I just say today's news in pretty depressing
White House blocked someone from showing up at congress
And Blizzard went off the deep end
what news is this?

it sounds like this wasn’t a subpoena yet, so this is more annoying than criminal. 
Yea but it's totally a game of brinksmanship which becomes a question of how blinks first
??
found it
Oh yea
Does this help you with the crazy with HK vs China Dakota?
Trump and HK are the only world events I am following
I would probably add Brexit to that, but other than that you got all the really big world events
GOOD MORNING!
IT'S A NEW DAY!
Good Morning Aysh
<@UDC03KCGK> how does it feel to no longer be an employee at park?
It's a little weird. Leaving on a pretty good note and unsure if the next place will be waaaaay better or actually a little worse. That all strikes me as a good thing, but an unusual one for me.
Well best of luck
At the very least, hours will be better
Man I love finance, people have no idea the level of shenanigans you can perform with money
Finance is a lot of people taking something simple, and making it very very complicated. It's like an unraveling argument in "What is fair?"
If you've ever been on the subreddit WallstreetBets, those guys are hilarious
That they are
Someone just realized that American Options can be called any time, not just at expiration
They were then telling this same person, that you don't even need to buy options in order to sell them
And he was like "WHAAAAAA?"
Also I'm not even referring to your stuff Drew, I'm referring to the really complicated stock market stuff you can do
Oh yeah, it'll be better hours, almost guaranteed better pay (per hour or just straight up overall), and an easier commute where I'm not trying to avoid Uber expenses on the daily. 
I'll also have a proper bar manager. Also potentially benefits. Hell, a TV or screen showing the big game of the day. 
I just only have Park as a comparison point for restaurant work. It also gave me a lot of freedom to do what I wanted, and I was clearly valued.
Oh I know. This stuff just shares the same core open field rules jiggering that interest rates and annuities have going on too. 
Simply put: you could make Finance super simple if you locked in a couple wide arching tenants. Same with taxes. However, we don't, and as a result things can get super complicated in a hurry and all come down to "Can I make an argument for this? Yes? Let's do it!"
This is what makes the movie "The Big Short" so much fun to watch. It's visually trying to depict the ridiculousness of some of this stuff. 
Christian Bale's character was literally shorting an entire market. Created an entire product for people to bet on.
I'm aware of this, but only vaguely. Got any link to any logistics on that?
lol
I think in this case you're just the originator of the option.  Remember options are 2 party agreements, you don't need to buy any in order to sell them
In short: I'm used to leaving a job where the next thing is clearly better. Usually pretty negative about the last place. Here, I still have goodwill toward Park. I don't think I'll ever go back to work for them, but it was a fun time. So even if Time Out is better in every way, it's still an unusual place for me to be.
Understandable, I've also never been in that position
I usually leave for a reason
I think it's more the fact, that in finance you can build a vehicle to do what you need.  And you know it involves money and math so people get really dumb really fast
Oh, yeah that's kind of a no brainer to me. Someone can call the option at a way lower price and you'll be like "Sure, I'll sell you 50 shares at $75 when the price is now $35 a share."
It just sucks if you sell an option like that and someone goes "I'd like those shares please!" And you're sitting there with no shares on hand and paying out $175 a share on the spot
People get dumb just about the money part. The math can be stupid simple and people would still freak out and make dumb psychology decisions.
You wouldn't call the option out of money
But yes you can sell it out of the money
Like how we don't value a $5 bill and 5 $1 bills the same way.
My favorite is that phrasing things has influence. If you roll a 6 sided die, you can win 5 dollars for 1-5, but if you get a 6 you'll win 10 dollars.  Vs if you play this game, you get 10 dollars unless you roll a 1-5 then you only get 5
:justmonika: :just_monika:
Clearly someone is enjoying DDLC
I think one dude has created like 90% of wayfair's anime emojis
Really? That's hilarious
Yeah, that phrasing can be very confusing for people. Though I would argue the second way is intentionally obfuscating.
I did a bad job of describing, but people are risk adverse.  By stating the same odds going lower to higher you have higher participation than going from higher to lower rewards
Good Morning!
Summon the silent
Mine seems a bit too close to home
THEY"RE COMING FOR YOU!!!
Ohhhhh question
How's the job search coming?
whats the backstory to that Victoria?
Victoria’s is the plot to Batman Begins. 
@ayshu back story is I left wayfair to work a 6 month contract which has now ended, so I'm job searching again
<@UDDE5960N> job search is going
Booooo, best of luck!

Guess I should have shared all the slack shortcuts they had
I'm playing `Twilight Imperium` on Sunday :hy::pe:
(#7)
#nonwork-bos is having a day
Are you telling me there was candy in the snack wall? Whattt? And I’m not there to enjoy it. 
snickers, 3 musketeers, milkyways
smarties
Some good options there. 
I'd prefer they weren't there
:get-the-popcorn-ready-this-is-gonna-be-good:
I needed this
yup it was a good one. drama, but it's not at the expense of anybody
that's my former team's coop
TWIX
Is that Welsh?
yep
I’ve never been to Wales. I’ve been to Bath, which is kind of close, like 50 miles. 
Brenden be spreading our gospel
Goodwill has Clue and Balderdash in good condition
And Axis and Allies
Which goodwill did you see them in? I need to snag some of these steals you and Dakota are finding
"The Goodwill Store" on Commonwealth ave
Do you want me to pick up any of those 3 for you?
Hey that's my goodwill hands off
Been going there longer than you
Sorry, just saw this. I'll pass on those specific games, but will need to make the trek out there sometime
Good Morning!
Summon the silent
Monday is death
played Twilight Imperium (4th edition) yesterday... all ten hours of it
`<https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233078/twilight-imperium-fourth-edition>`
And the verdict is worth the 10 hours?
It's a good game, but I'm not sure I want to do another ten hour game
perhaps fewer players
perhaps when less alcohol is involved
perhaps when there's no first-timer in the game
How many players? And does player count decrease game time?
I played with 6 players
Only 2nd timers and above?
I was the only 1st itmer
timer*
No i was busting your chops because you said you'd be more interested in another with no first timers (like you were this game)
yeah, I think I slowed it down a bit
but I think alcohol did worse than I
LOL!
The ban should be the random one
I that
Told you
I cleared `that`
Ahhhhh
I can say I've always been interested in playing that game, but the time sink on it seems... unattainable
I hear that it can be done in 6 hours
assassination
Also you all don't get Columbus day off, right?
Nope we're here at work
yep, wayfair doesn't give us the day off
It's a bullshit holiday anyway
Sure, but how likely are you to find people that will dedicate 6 hours that also won't dedicate 10 hours.  I think once you get over like the 4 hour mark you're in all day territory, and I haven't met a ton of people willing to do games more than an hour
I was invited to play, didn't form it myself
true
I just ran through an airport. They didn’t give me a boarding pass until the time boarding was supposed to start. Got through security, ran to the farthest gate, boarding hasn’t started yet. 
Other than you, no one I know plays it
I'm up for any holiday where I don't have to work
Well you made it doug
That's all that matters
I think it would be cool to have a digital version that you could play asynchronously like race for the galaxy
That sounds fun, I don't mind sinking 10 hours over like 2 weeks
Not on the plane yet. 
Too soon to celebrate
Yea, but it's not like it took off without you
You're there so even if things go tits up you still get taken care of
Do we not get today off? I’m wondering if I knew that when I signed up for PTO. 
Eh, workday probably told me. 
<http://www.astralvault.net/games/SA/>
someone did just that for 3rd edition
and made balance changes
for tabletop simulator
But does Tabletop Simulator handle asynchronous gaming?
Also I really do like having it on my phone it's much more convenient to be playing it during my commute
Well, either way your boss should probably know you weren't going to be around today
Are you flying back today, and working tomorrow?
I think I took tomorrow off as well? I don’t entirely remember. I will be in Boston around 18:00
yeah fair
looks like it doesn't technically support asynchronous gaming
but you could do it
Booooooooo
just have someone with a desktop host the game and leave their computer on for a month
lol
take turns at will
That is expensive power bill!
Local time?
I guessing local but that makes it like 4 am your time?
Well that would be why he was running. Probably overslept
Is it? The computer usually isn't a huge suck on my power. The AC is
No silly he's going arrive in boston during sleepy time in Europe, not the other way around
Do you leave your computer on full running as much as you run your AC? I generally don't
I used to back when I had a piece of junk with little battery life
as it was always plugged in at my desk
But plugged in vs running is different.  Yes plugged in uses Juice, but not nearly as much as running
Some good anime in this last batch
:boruto's-dad-run: makes me sad
Lol i didn't even notice that
In the show, they always reference naruto as "Boruto's Dad"
Not even as the hokage?
Nope, I was running because the first leg of the trip got delayed. 
Wasn't he Hokage for like, the last episode?
It's in the future he's still hokage!
I guess? I didn't bother to get into Naruto, and 300 episodes later I think that was the right call. 
Too bad One Piece is so damn long, I thought that one was fun for a season
It’s only 1am Vienna time now. 
So not too bad. 
Worse on the way out since I basically lost a night. 
Good morning! I’ve been up since 4:30 because time zones suck. 
Did you fight to go to sleep at 10?
Perferable midnight really
That first day back, gotta suck it and fight the suck
Good Morning!
Summon the Silent
Alright Dakota, I don't know what you did, but I would prefer you stand far away from me
Yeah, I managed to stay up until a decent time last night. 
Stars with unnatural power and teeth.... that's nightmare level stuff
Couple more day so of that, and you'll be back to normal
I have fight with Mei to get her to stay awake
I didn’t mean to send that to the channel. Oh slack mobile. 
good morning
is it friday yet
DUN DUN DUN!!!!\
Nope Aysh
You got almost the whole week to fight through!
why should i fight, cant i just curl up in a corner and sleep?
Because if you sleep in the corner you get beat
depends on the game. a sleeping snorlax is a heavy hitter.
snore has power 50, 100% accuracy.
?
annoying questions are annoyin
Thanks nightmare bot, you truly are delightful
I don't even know what Friday means anymore. I have a great schedule this week, where I work a day, then get a day off. We'll see what next week's schedule turns into, but it is a nice first week in.
Plus shifts are now about 6-7 hours for me where before they were 8-11 hours
People are super dumb Aysh, some days you just get use to repeating yourself
why is everyone so quiet?
CJ has been abducted by his evil clone. 
Evil-er 
I'm pretty sure that goes all the way around to `Good Clone` personally
Just a lot of meetings lately
<@UDC4QL95G> Are there still cookies up on 10?
dunno im wfh
Um. 
The internet is a great place, I have no context or understanding of that gif, but it makes me laugh and I need to share it
I was going for this, it's in the thread above for dakota
But that's the only gif that comes up with the way I did it
And..... it makes me giggle uncontrollable so you all get to enjoy it
Ah, home sweet cannon. You miss the comforts of home. 
Nice! Home is great!
nice, turns out my desk is still here. I'd like to say that's always the case when I get back from vacation, but sadly, it is not.
Ummmmm..... that sounds weird.....
first time I went to Europe, the whole team moved to the other side of the floor. and totally didn't mention this on slack at all. so I get back and not only is my stuff gone, but I don't see anyone I recognize either (I hadn't been at WF all that long)
it was a waking nightmare.
At least you were clothed
thats not good team communication
Unexpected desk moves are the reason I'd always check my email the last day of vacation when I was at wayfair
That is.... concerning and hilarious
I came back from a vacation once and it turned out i was suddenly on a different team
they didn't move my stuff, but they made me move it as the first thing I did when I got back
Akward
It was a team half made up of people on my previous team, and my manager didn't change, but the area I was working on was suddenly storefront
It was interesting
My last week, I came back from lunch and my team had moved. Apparently it was a last minute thing, but no one told me
Wayfair was _so_ much fun
:sideeye:
that seems passive agressive
Ummmmm..... I like my team better than whatever you guys deal with
i like my team too
my current team is great
I've always liked my teams. My "issue" was more of a coincidence of timing
:stevenuniverse:
Im interviewing someone today who started coding when I was 4
oof
jeez
I didn't start coding till college
Unless you count my Ti83 Calculator
oh, right, I did so much on my ti83
I made blackjack (though i never quite got retroactive Aces working)
My Ti-84 got wiped because my teacher fixed a setting by just wiping the ram. So I didn't feel super inclined to play with the software much after that
I think I made rock paper scissors, and started tic-tac-toe
coding was so tedious on that thin
wait...when *I* was 4- not when they were 4
I got you. Not sure if they did or not. Still, that must be intimidating. "Uh, not sure you're qualified for this position. We don't use Perl so your skills there aren't helpful. How do you feel about Labs?"
i just feel silly telling them 'write a query to find movies with Tommy as actor AND director
also, im aware this is a bias and i shouldnt go by numbers
oh whoops. i'm less impressed now
I mean, 20 yrs of experience is still 20 years
If you're still coding in 15 years, I'll still be impressed with what you can do
he's been a mangaer/ director recently
recently = 15 years
hmmmm something diesn't seem right here
The package is lost, but we got a week of use out of it?
:thonkang:
Also sounds like they straight up had really hard sex and broke the middle of the couch
Or they are very large people and both sat right in the middle
their email address
I think they are just pulling keywords trying to get free stuff
Yeah, this looks fradulent
Love it, "Also my leg is hurt"
Casual...
I thought it was a 'Summon the Silent' prediction at first
```In addition, I do product reviews and this situation would not fair well on my social platforms. Please escalate this case if necessary to ensure there is no charge to return the chairs.```
lady has 66 followers.
Hahahhahahahaha
....chairs?
she ordered $200 in chairs
but its the sofa that broke
oh that's a different person
s
should have made that clear
so- i just ordered a coffee table (open box) - one of the hardware things was missing  (sticky pads that keep the glass top in place) and theyre giving me a full refund for that
granted, its like $40, but
and letting you keep it?
yeah
i didnt ask for a refund they just gave it
i feel weird
That's all they can do with open box
Having been the person trying to optimize merchandising sofas and sectionals, this happens to these products a lot if they come small/medium parcel because they're shitty and people don't know how to assemble them.

But that is def fraud
is that a _Fraud Gurantee_?
typically they do not stock parts for open box stuff
I think the default resolution for cheap items is just to write it off
please indicate youre speaking about  the person Dakota was referencing and not me :cry:
im not a fraud \
<https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a29471656/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-henchman-fraud-guarantee/>
No the customer's are trying to fraud, not you ayshu
oh
thank you, Victoria :slightly_smiling_face:
Aysh is most likely scamming us right now, we just don't know how yet
I mean I wouldn't be shocked, but I would be disappointed
why would that be disappointing? why else do I exist?
Aysh is just straight chaos, no fraud to be found
why , thank you
everyone should have a grift or heist going at all times
That seems like a lot of effort
I like just adding chaos to the mix
I mean sure, scam a company or a stranger, but not this slack group. This is the group where you find accomplices not victims
This is very true
in a similar vein- i received an amazon package that was wet and covered in a plastic bag and smelled of trash

Got a refund for that since it was deemed 'unsafe to return'
*yesterday
lol
it was stinky and i threw it though
You have the most interesting stories Aysh
I can smell sarcasm :@
That’s a great minor super power. 
No sarcasm, literally you're stories are always amusing
I have never received a wet packaged wrapped in a plastic bag that smelt like garbage
Nor any of the other terrible things you tell me about your life
Yeah Aysh is the real embodiment of chaos in this group. The rest of us are just posers
I always thought I had the best stories, but even I can't keep up with Ayshu
I have mastered the art of complaining.
It's called story telling, and yes you have
I just saw a new orange line car!
At back bay, going the other way. 
Sounds like a mirage to me

Good morning all :wave:
Good morning!!!!
Hello- Once upon a time I made a joke that no one understood until I explained it. Since a joke is funniest when it requires explanation, I am going to say it again.
We were driving through a town called 'Fancy Gap' in Virginia and someone pointed out the name. And I asked 'Oh, Banana Republic?'

get it? get it?
it was funny in my head
That requires knowing the relative status of various clothing retailers, which I don't, but am now picking up from context.
still, pretty quick to get that as you're driving past a road sign.
Same company owns Old Navy &gt; Gap&gt; Banana republic
All I know is that Banana Republic is just the absolute worst name for a clothing store.
Good morning!
Why are there no emojis to accuse someone of being racist? :hr: ?
Nah i think Banana Republic is pretty spot on for a clothing store
In my pathfinder game last night, someone said something like 'that's what makes the world go round’. But we had already established in the lore that the world was actually flat. So another player derisively calls out “so you’re one of those round-earthers.” It was delivered so seriously, it ended up derailing us, we laughed so hard.
no its got some racist implications- the phrase itself
not even implication.
thats funnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
its pretty direct.
I mean yea, and I would argue that clothing companies are just as bad as the banana companies
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
That's pretty great
Also becomes a question of who banana republic is pointed at
The company, the US, or the country
Ahh, yet another fake fishing attempt

FAVORITE EMAIL NAME EVER!!!!! `<mailto:crodriguez6+canned.response@wayfair.com|crodriguez6+canned.response@wayfair.com>`
I don't think I've gotten this email
Nah I think it's pretty clever. It will catch people who will click the unsubscribe link
it sounds like they are still rolling in
unsubscribe link hack. That is pretty clever
yup
unsubscribe link hack.?
putting the malicious link in the unsubscribe.
people want t oclick unsubscribe so badly
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
yeah it is clever!
what if you click'start reading'?
they are the same link
well one has a `?l=56`, and the other has a `?l=59` so they will know which one you clicked
`hapening`
I never quite understood why all these phishing tests had mis-spellings in them
You know to catch the dumb people
like, why not make it look real?
Because misspellings are really in the phishing attempt
`interset`
It's to eliminate the smart people who catch on
true, but training people to rely on misspellings doesn't seem productive
because good phishing emails won't have them
CJ wants to eliminate smart people. ok, we're playing Euphoria now.
and the email will have to be good to get through corporate filters for the most part
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'm not a red hat
ah, there is the phishing email. I see it now
man, somebody linked a chrome extionsion yesterday for bulk uploading emojis to slack.
we don't need more emotes in bulk
so many emotes
Nah, that chrome extension will allow the author full access to every slack instance of a user that installs it
ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
and it had like 18k installations
things like that make me realize how easy "hacking" can be
people are dumb
permanent tokens are not a great idea
for example. The token that that extension uses can use this link as well:
```<https://slack.com/api/conversations.list?token=[[your> slack token]]```
which gives a MASSIVE json with details on EVERY SINGLE CHANNEL YOU CAN SEE

good thing we don't have business secrets in our slack channels.
just people complaining about each other
not enough of :f-this:
lol
Alright today has a pretty great megamoji
show us!
oh we have to wait
it's uploading
windows background!
:bliss:
I had the bibimbap food truck for lunch today. now I'm munching on pistachios.
this is only the post lunch snacking ive done
also- the salt + pepper cashews are really good
you all neeed to check out #bos-cop-freefood
I caused a lot of chaos today
i left it because people were so annoying about the 'not free food' thing
i mean- if youre SO busy just buy food :confused:
could you clarify what you meant by that?
you don't like :this-is-not-free-food: ?
or you didn't like people hating on :this-is-not-free-food: for being "passive aggressive" ?
LOLOLOL I Love your idea though!
i dont like that someone could innocently ask/ say something and get told off :confused:
Ummmmmmm that was intersting
Sooooo many automated messages
I think a one and done would be good enough
that's not possible
That's what I was hoping for
Really how interesting
People are abusing the toggle feature
And this children is why we can't have nice things, because people are assholes
I'm still really sad about your bot brenden
Chaos cannot be handed to just anyone
why are you sad?
because people abused the power?
yes
So we had to turn it off
well, I turned it off
but yeah
We could have brought a little <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> to Wayfair, BUT THEY CAN"T HANDLE THE POWER!
clearly
the admin that reached out to me regarding the workflow
LOL!
was it because you were bringing slack to it's knees?
he received many complaints about it
I mean it was well meaning slightly passive aggressive hilarity
yessir
I'm not surprised
There were defintly some people who even before the abuse were like `This is a terrible idea and I'm antifun`
Bot?
it wasn't a bit, it was a slack workflow
Check out the mayhem in cop free food
I see
I mean you have access to slack api with your personal token. It wouldn't be hard to spin up another glitch server that monitors that channel
and posting messages with hubot is easy
now set one up for :did-you-mean-folks:
Wait what was the complaint? It wouldn't notify anyone but the poster
The fact that people made 700 length thread with it
And the only place to discuss in that channel is in threads
What did the workflow do to #freefood?
Posted a message every time a specific emoji was added/removed
It was basically a repeat of what happened when when bots could trigger eachother
No, the problem is it messaged the thread everytime someone added an emoji.  So someone sat there and added and removed the emoji over and over again
Like the announcements-bos fiasco 
Pretty much!
good morning good morning!
Good Morning!
Good morning chaos!
What is a movie/ TV show that will be releasing soon that you're excited about&gt;
Morning
most of the tv shows just started up again. excited for the last season of The Good Place.
movies, idk. I should be Joker eventually. I know Jyo and Deep saw it while I was in Europe.
Joker is totally worth a watch
I watched the first half of Chernobyl on the flight, I should get around to finishing that. although I don't have HBO
After endgame, all movies seem empty and without meaning Aysh
Doug that seems like a poor decision
I'll probably see joker at some point as well. I don't really follow TV, but I have some friends that are pretty pumped for some of the new anime that have started.
Joker's reviews made me feel Meh. Agree about the good place though!
Maybe Ill watch Joker at home sometime
If you do watch it at home, you have to turn out the ligths and be focused
The movie won't make sense if you're doing something else
can do!
One of the reasons i watch anime when I do, is because the subtitles force me to concentrate on the screen and not look at my phone
I play anime on my phone so i can do both!
i resent your logic
Rick and Morty season 4 is supposed to start soon-ish
lot of destiny ones today
density is my destiny
Good place is great, and I have plans to see Joker tomorrow morning
imagination

small price to pay for the 'gram
I really dislike instagram for personal use
Which is why I don't acutally use mine
It represents what I dislike most about my generation (and nearby ones)
Validation through social media
GO WATCH
I use no social media except linked in, you know for jobs and stuff
Same, minus linked in
you are all too comfortable in your own skin. Join me on the dark side.
Eh I don't like taking pictures of mysefl
Too much effort Aysh
I have to care.... and I don't care
exactly why its the dark side :@
I also just don't like Facebook or its derivitives
you are all so self assured
HMPF
that is the charitable interpretation. :slightly_smiling_face:
Hold my pony's flagon?
I'm pretty sure you're confusing self assurance with sheer laziness
I think you missed the clever joke
I think it's suppose to be more like hmph
Hydrophobic Monkeys Performing the Flamingo
*flamenco
Some days you worry me
TIL
Ohhhhhh?
Yeah really not sure why that was the first thing that came to mind
I go with what Aysh's gives me
ba dum tish
it was SO clever that I didnt get it

Toronto Is Lies?
I've not been, so quite possible.
Oof, Orange line is running shuttles between Sullivan and Haymarket today. Guess I have to use the green line. 
Good morning!
Summon the silent
At least you have other options doug, although i imagine that's gonna put a strain on all the lines
Yeah, I don’t think this will affect just me from this group. 
We're suppose to be doing Boda Borg tonight, we're going to see if we can reschedule
Yeah, its unclear if there will be regular service by the end of work. 
I'm gonna go with a no personally because they were suppose to be done this weekend
Yup. 
my team was going to go to boda borg this month. Then the higher ups decided to have a STO floor party and take away all the pod money
what?
I didn't even know people could do that.

^ turns out not everyone is Blizzard.
Bold move by WOTC/Hasbro
yeah. We even rolled over last month intentionaly to have 30 to cover the cost
they were just like "nope we take the rolled over 10 too"
League of Legends Wolds is coming up on its final stages. it will be interesting to see if they have to deal with anything like that.
Though seeing as Tenicent has a majority share of Riot games, I cannot see them handling it well
I thought there were already fucked ups by riot given the whole Hong Kong thing
Wow, dick move
Someone has a hard on for Final Fantasy Paladins
I never played FF 11, that's the MMO, right?

thinking of JRPGs, I just started Dragon Quest 11 on the switch.
I think anything beyond 10 is MMO, this one looks like 14 personally
15 isn't
which I think is the newest one?
15 isn't???? I thought all the new ones were MMOs
no
12 also isn't
oh, and neither is 13
or 13-2 or 1303
I think only 11 and 14 are MMOs
guys I hate dynamic sql
but it's unfortunately necessary
Yes. 
I'm trying to refactor our scheduling stored procedure to use dynamic sql, and it's a large undertaking
Well, dynamic SQL might not be needed. You could use an ORM. 
could you elaborate on this?
that's what I'm trying to do
WTF is dynamic SQL?
sql that writes sql
depends on exactly what you're doing.

ORM in general a strategy to represent tables and such as code objects.
basically this couples with the idea that sql is a query language, so it should not be making decisions itself.
so you're storing objects instead of records?
and fetching objects that have built in methods?
so here is a simple example:

composing sql yourself
```
'INSERT INTO csn_switchboard.dbo.tblDeadEvent ("topic", "message") VALUES (' . $value . ', ' . $value2 . ')'
```

ORM
```
deadEventTable = Table("tblDeadEvent", metadata, autoload=True)
        insertCommand = insert(deadEventTable)
        insertCommand = insertCommand.values(
            {"topic": topic, "message": message}
        )
```
its possible to let the code handle joins and such as well.
note, I set this up in Python, I'm not sure how to make an ORM work simply with PHP-PDO
but you could write your own query objects.
SQL reads, code decides.
interesting option, but that kind of refactor likely wouldn't be allowed at this point
we're looking to migrate infrastructure at some point
they just want me to optimize the current system
that's probably good.

In general, the thing I think gives people the most grief with SQL is that it is powerful enough to do anything, so they use it for things its not meant for. A larger refactor would hopefully give your team an opportunity to pull out from SQL a number of things.
we're looking to migrate to GCP IIRC
so yeah, we don't want to stay in SQL
but we are doing a bit much in it
GCP is just a location. you can still have SQL there.
I believe they want to limit the scope of the sql as a part of the migration
ah. that is a good thing
At that point why don't you just use a normal programming language with a sql package?
depending on the size of the sproc, that can be a big undertaking. Its really easy for undisciplined coding to produce giant sprocs. WF has many of them floating around.
That is a dick move, you lost more money then other teams because of something you intentionally oldness
You should have $30 per person next month instead of $20
this one is around 1500 lines long
:luffy_vomit:
that will take a huge effort to get that into a reasonable state.
yep.
on the bright side, I'm really only looking at the first 1100 lines
:fainting:
:finger_up:
:finger_down:
<@UHQD9J1SL> I read your release note!
Woot!
You clearly care about consolidation
I have NO IDEA what any of it means
But I know it's from you!
<@UDDE5960N> looks like the orange line is back up. but if you end up going to Boda Borg on a Tuesday-Thursday you will end up needing a shuttle from Malden Center to Wellington
only 1 stop, not so bad.
yeah
3 people on my team are also on vacation, so will not be able to attend the party either
We switched this evening to Max Brenner
This is like something you announce earlier
chocolate!
Yes, good to know doug! I think the other manager and I are going to push for a during the work day start time
why max brenner?
today is monday
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
IT WAS CHOSEN
lolita has all you can eat tacos with a drink
turn your pod outing into Captain Sonar
Our pod is 1 short of having enough people
there's only 7 of us
`On most Monday’s, you can get all you can eat tacos at Lolita for only $9 a person plus the purchase of a cocktail.`
tacos!!
Doug you seem very distracted by food
I'm just trying to be excited for you CJ.
also, tacos.
tacos are always exciting.
lol
I spent the whole day just heads down coding. It was glreat.
Same!
I'm almost done refactoring
I did zero coding today. Mostly reading documentation. 
All coding days are generally good ones. 
LOL!
What did you write?
The js is super lazy, but the back end required some interesting API work
I also hadn't touched JS in a super long time so that is always fun
WTF DOES IT DO!?!?!?!
just to clarify, do you see the video?
hmmm that thing is blurry as heck, interesting
I mean
I watched it
Effictively allows users to toggle on/off emails being taken in and processed via the gmail api.
But I don't know what it means
What's intercept
Uhhhhhh I feel dummer
We have a third party that has a program that sits on the <mailto:Service@wayfair.com|Service@wayfair.com> Email box.
this turns that on and off?
by pushing a button?
The interception process grabs the emails before the third party can, messes with them, then decides whether or not to allow the third party to take them
Thus intercepting the email
If shit hits the fan, we need to turn off interception, and the only way to do so is to delete a filter in gmail
Awkward!
That page automates creating/deleting the filter and gives a count of the backlog of emails stuck in the box
Huh what video
Video in channel above this
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooood MORNING VIETNAM!
<@UETS9HTSS> <@UDDE5960N> <@UDC4QL95G> <@UHQD9J1SL> <@UDD45P5A9> <@UDBV9N1E0>
SUMMON THE SILENT
SO MUCH PINGING!!!!!
is today a game night?
that's a lot of @mentions
Manged to avoid one of them
Tonight is game night I totally forgot
I have the new century
so there's that
Good morning!!!!
I am not awake enough for this. *hits snooze*
HI <@UDD45P5A9>! Good morning <@UDD45P5A9>!
Aysh, the hero we don't deserve, but definitely the villain that we do.
Hits snooze again
<@UDD45P5A9> you cannot snooze me, I am awake!
I can do anything I put my mind to
<@UDD45P5A9> I challenge you to try making me go to the gym everyday!
<@UHQD9J1SL> I TAKE UP THAT CHALLENGE!!!!
so- should I go to the gym this evening? or play games with you all?
I'm clearly going to just message you at 7 every morning to go to the Gym
ill be asleep then
EXACTLY! So I'll ping you awake so you can go to the gym
Fat chance
what does everyone here do for thanksgiving?
Dinner with Families
um, hope a friend organizes something, otherwise ignore the holiday.
Jyo's got you covered dont worry :smile:
nice
like- a traditional thansgiving meal, holding hands, saying what yorue thankful for?
like in cartoons and movies?
My family does the big meal. I was always annoyed that Thanksgiving was the one day a year people decided dinner was at 2:00
then there was a lot of extended family hanging out watching football, which was sooooo boring.
so I did not grow up much of a thansgiving fan
My mom's family does a mediocre big meal
I like the people, but the food is meh
Uhhhhhh, we generally do a pretty good food
Although there's been many years where we've gone out to eat too
yeah, I think some families use tradition as an excuse to keep serving bad food. thanksgiving food can be good
Sure glad they took away our pod money for this:
```Hope you're all excited for the Pumpkin Spice Floor Party this Thursday! Dress code is Fall Fetch - vests, flannel, riding boots, Uggs, Barbour jackets, etc. Basically basic. We'll have pizza and themed drinks, fall flower crowns (back by popular demand), and other fun activities.```
you've walked into my nightmare.
i really need to see everyone in those crowns
why would they expect people to have those kind of things to wear?
riding boots?
in boston?
what?
you have to make the crowns yourself, which people are not very good at
It was pretty dissappointing last time
what are fall flowers?
but it's back by popular demand Dakota
clearly everyone loved it
I also don't what what a Barbour jacket is
(please don't tell me, I also don't care)
its the thing you wear at a hairdresser's
70% of the money was spent on the flowers last time (only one of which even was a flower, the rest were just green plants)
25% of the money on 3 different kinds of bad wine and berries to make them look fancy
5% of the money was spent on sandwiches which ran out before everybody could eat (except for the bad options literally nobody wanted)
TOO LATE
:smile:
right, people don't associated FALL with FLOWERS
that's SPRING
well it was spring last time this group decided to hijack our pod outing money
FALL has LEAVES!!
just don't go. pod outings are optional.
but do be annoyed about the Boda Borg part.
true, but it starts at 4, and it is on my floor. Also there is no opting out so there is no getting the pod money back
I don't like Pumpkin spice, but I don't really get the role its playing in culture right now. like there is a PS-backlash, then a backlash to the backlash. There is too much significance placed on this one flavor.
like everything has to be a cultural battleground with a flag to fly.
Pod outings are three or more, so you can opt out
This isn't considered a pod outing. they just took the money to throw a STO party
Wow this evil
Thank god my director is a decent person
I also like how the fall party is just a lunch this year
Yea, it's only going to get worse Dakota
Soon the only real party will be the Winter one
The one I don't go to :sadpanda:
Same. I’m not going to dress up for a work party. 
I mean you guys could go as the bum brigade!
Also not willing to do that
I will be out of the country this year during that so I don't care either way
really only way i'd ever go is if I had a +1 who wanted to
sure, that would be reasonable.
I am mad for your team Dakota. That pod outing money was yours and you should not be forced to use it for something your team has no interest in.
If I still worked in Finance I would totally have messed with the PO strings to make sure it didn't get properly funded and your team got its money back
Have you asked to have your budget back?
I asked my manager and he said no
:same:
Me
*send email saying 'Register here for your ticket'.
Le Person:
Hi, Where should I register?
sounds right.
Oh, I have missed alot...
Anyways thought you guys might like this: <https://tabletopia.com/games>?
huh that is pretty neat
looks like it is either $5 or $10 per month. though it looks like for $10 you can have guests play with you without a preimum account
And 10 games at a time
<@UHQD9J1SL> did you go to the gym? If not, everyone is disappoint
I am now! Just got home
Riiiight after some ice cream
<@UHQD9J1SL> DID YOU GO THE T
GYM IF NOT DO SO NOW!!!!
I'm doing lunges right now omg
Success!
It's working!
Make a bot for it
<@UDC4QL95G>
No please noooo
Your safe aysh Prometheus only works off of events not timing, however we could program a bot to go off at a certain time....
That would be significantly less annoying though
I mean less effective
Silly aysh I'm up before 7 every day. If motivated I can annoy you everyday
<@UHQD9J1SL> Get up and go to the gym!
Eh it's work time!
Good morning!!!!
CJ you should sleep more
Those few extra minutes in the morning are everything
Sweet Bliss
I literally can't, because I have dedicated Schedules to hit
Good Morning!
Summon the Silent

:wave:
whats ideal snacking food for 2:30 to 4 PM? For an event
chips? pretzels?
at work so something we cant get at work
homemade dip?
like a good queso or something
ah dips with pretzels- let me see if panera has something along those lines
Pretzel go well with like a beer cheese
its at work and im not gonna make anything myself, for context
If Panera doesn't have it, Star Market is right near by, they probably have some good dips and salty things to dip into them.
Don't know if they'd have beer cheese, wikipedia is telling me its a Kentuckiana thing? I thought you could get that anywhere in the US. hm.
Star market is EXPENSIVE
im sticking with panera
:excuse-me:
panera is expensive too
usually grocery stores give better prices than resturaunts
<@UHQD9J1SL> you think it would be cheaper to go to panera than star market?
what are you buying?
actually no, but i can get it delivered and panera makes i much easier to order
just a fruit tray with star market for = $2 per person
fruit + *pastry tray* at panera for $5 per person
I feel like the Math just doesn't add up here.......
tell me more
well you back into and say you're paying $3 per person for a pastry tray, I mean you're not comparing like things here
You gotta control just 1 variable or do some normalizations!
Otherwise I have some great beach front property to sell you
im not but i wouldnt stop with just fruit anyway. a pastry is about $3 and they have delivery with panera so its easier
:shocko:
Somebody is feeling :salty: today, :still-a-piece-of-garbage: is kinda mean
I cannot parse that visual at all. I just see flashing colors. There are a lot of emotes that people didn't consider what they'd look like at size.
Pretty much
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZUcpVmEHuk>
ok, at that size it is much more understandable.
same dude who did <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs>
That is a very particular style. 
I WAS WRONG:
just a fruit tray with star market for = $4 per person
fruit + *pastry tray* at panera for $5 per person
but what are the quantity differences between the two?
turns out there is a fall fest on the ground floor of boylston. WF ID got us in. there is cider, popcorn, pumpkins, a band, and a petty zoo with like a goat and a rabbit and puppies.
I only found this out because the band was bleeding through to floor 2, so we had to find the source
Nice
Where exactly is it?
My team heard petting zoo and kinda lost their minds
ground floor, one of the hallways between 500 and 222
the hallway closer to the back entrance to Boylston
whoa
indoor petting zoo
like bunnies and puppies, not like a full petting zoo.
but you can pet stuff.
STILL!
how long is it open
don't know
<@UDDE5960N>?
We're here didn't check
Just says 1pm
So guess you'll just have to find out aysh
there are people just walking around handing out bunnies and kittens wrapped in blankets
that I did not see
there is a piglet in the petting zoo too
Did not see the piglet
The piglet only appears to those pure of heart.
:rekt:
So Dakota has a pure black heart, GOOD TO KNOW I STILL HAVE SOME WHITE!
Wait what?
? Did you delete a deja vu?
IT TOOK FOREVER TO FIND THAT
yes it triggered off a Giphy search
never got around to fixing that
Yes
that's correct
That is not inaccurate
Ummmmm?
did we discuss the lady who sent an email to nonwork advertising open positions in her fiance's company?

no

Just anted to make sure I wasn't reposting old news
Yes but I'm confused about why it's news
Cuz she also bumped the email thread again:
```Bumping this! Slack or email me directly if you know someone who would like to learn more about the role!```
Isn't that poaching?
like, "you all work at wayfair, what if I tell you there is a better place to work"
well, she works at WF
Is that not weird to send to a mailing list in your workplace?
yeah, its weird.
`Anyone's friends and Family`
Is how you get away from poaching
I mean it's also just a straight sales roll
I don't think Wayfair is the target audience for `High School Diploma/GED` level people
we have a lot of different roles at WF
I'm still going not our target market
But, wayfair hires a whole lotta different levels of people
what is wayfair target market?
College educated
Unless your in a call center, then we're just looking for a warm pulse
Or in a warehouse, then a strong back
but.. we have so many sales people here
and SSCs
which I think have access to nonwork
and usually hate their jobs
Do we? I didn't realize that
yeah we have massive turnover for SSCs
No I meant that they're here
I thought we got rid of them because costs are high here
we got rid of a bunch of them, but not all
I have some CAT people stitting behind me
ahhhhhh
Dunno what to tell you then
Ohhhh <@UDC03KCGK> did we win last night?
did you play the new spice road?
I've played it here at the office
But not with you guys
I won
Boooooo
We didn't play it last night
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
My roles were such shit for so early
Had a 2 cube turn for the win
your rolls*
I think you should have reconfigured
Did you get a card that gave you extra actions or some other way
I TRIED
nah, got a 2 action cube, and a dominance cube in the same turn
I ROLLED 1 3 out of 4 times!
Ahhhh nice
Good morning!!!!!
Good Morning Aysh!
There was zero line at security. That was pretty good. 
Security?
You have a line to get into our building?
Logan. I’m flying to DC. 
Ahhhhhh
Whatcha doing there?
Ohh DC, just came from there. The weather is really nice right now
My brother is running a marathon. Really just an excuse to see him and my mom. Took three vacations to be able to see my full immediate family. Of 4 non-Doug people. 
DAMN!!! I see my immediate family like once a week. Only my parents
Did your 3 vacations have any overlap? Like you saw your mom all 3 times?
No overlap this year. 
Like there easily could be, they all live in the same county now. But plans have been really dumb this year.
logan airport is *touch wood* my favorite
the lines move so quickly!
what are non-Doug people
He's a family of 5
4 non dougs and a doug
Yeah, I’ve never had problems at Logan. 
ah
I was trying to reduce ambiguity. Clearly did not succeed. 
i thought maybe Doug was your last name :stuck_out_tongue:
That would be quite the twist. 
There's just so much awkward around this statement
Like in Kill Bill. Seriously, why did Tarantino ply coy with her name? It added nothing to the movie. 
Douglass is a fairly common last name. 
NOOOOOO DOnt Asian (Chinese?) have that ? where last name comes first?
Yup. 
yeah, see CJ?
Well, Family name comes first. 
Last can’t come first. Unless you’re Jesus. Or playing Beasty Bar. 
SEMANTICS
Yes. 
Semantics are important. It’s a large part of my job. 
lol
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. 
I probably only see my parents a few times per year as well. Them living halfway across the country tends to make meeting up difficult
*cough cough*
Yeah Sam and I don't see our immediate families much.
Yea, but 3 trips to see all of them.... that's just mind boggling to an only child
college being 3 hours away was a good way to get used to not seeing family for extended periods of time ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I mean I see them once a week right now because I've been doing so much construction, it's not what I would call "quality family time"
all family time is quality family time
prometheus doesn't agree apparently
Clearly you haven't been standing  there asking where the hammer is!!!!

hey why isn't there a `:he-clappy:`
just she and they

Hey Brenden what's up with the b5n?
b5n
It's me commenting on this silly shorthand:

also, I made :just-like-the-simulations:
People are weird, now Natalie Moore's name makes more sense
le sheet has hit le fan on our teams

We have hired engineers (internally and externally) and are now being told we cannot proceed
story time
details?
why?
we arent  'high priority' as of last evening
But reality is a sudden budgeting decision, which they d dont want to call it that
We've been making referrals from our personal network and meeting with  people internally to fill these roles and now have to tell them' no can do, sorry.'
this feels wrong
are you rescinding offers?
I thought we didn't "do budgets" here?
or just telling them the position is no longer available before offers were made?
exactly- so they dont openly say its a budget thing
Not recinding, routing them to other teams
and internal transfers- i dont know what to say-im holding off
also- we NEED these resources
NOT ANYMORE!
You know what the corporate calling card is
"Do more with less"
Welcome to being a fortune 500 kiddos!
my team now has 2 leads, 3 labsters and 1 L2
Which team are u on? 
My team is four L2s, one L3, and one L5
Merch eng
We had 2 L4s, 4 L3s and 4 L1s that was fun
4 L3s?
who was the manager?
Each manager had just 1 L1
that's... not how teams work
that's like mentorship
And then 1 L4 had all 4 L3s and 1 L4 reporting into him
ahh, so you did have an L4
2 L4s
one IC, one manager?
For a little while, then the other L4 took over 2 of the L3s
weird
Fuck yea
It was.... awkward
So Marissa now has slack at work
Should I create a new slack instance to chat?
or invite her to <#CDBT6UTCL|game-night-schemes> for coordination of game nights?
Just invite her here.
Whatever you think will be handled
YOU HAVE THE POWER JUST INVITE HER!
Invite sent
Oof.

Good Morning!
Summon the silent
Good morning :wave:
good morning! :slightly_smiling_face:
Random thoughts: I've been playing Starcraft more lately and the ridiculousness of a few marines being able to take out a Battlecruiser or an Ultralisk with basically a big rifle, is pretty ridiculous.
Ummm ok.... I need your bnet name
The flavors is not all that. Gameplay comes first. 
15 squirrels vs Emrakul. 
I mean the other way to think of is it take 4000 bullets to get a lucky hit that brings down the BC
Well, BC should be able to bombard from orbit. 
I mean I imagine that if they have the technology for interstellar war, I would imagine their rifles pack a bit more of a punch than the rifles we have today.
They are Gauss rifles after call
You're basically flinging metal spikes at stuff
Hell, it could just be a metal shell for the electromagnetic accleration, with some sort of superdense element inside, probably also superheated
WITH LAZERS
There are probably other problems if you say that the rifles have enough power to launch bullets into space. 
At some point you have to accept the flavor fail. 
Which is why they have battle armor doug
No, like with atmosphere. 
Starcraft is a fully functioning universe
Pshhhhh, they end to fight in space anyway!
I like being on this side of the arguement
<https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BlQ2tMQzg80>
I know gameplay wise that can happen! That's my point.
And.... it's a hallucination!
Because you use the thingy to make her human at the end of WoL
Premonition. She totally does that at the end of HotS when she kills Mensk. 
Also my analyst had a lot of fun watching that cinematic
That cinematic illustrates just how ridiculous it all is. That battlecruiser is 10 times the size of an ultralisk
Yup 
oh lol hadn't seen that cynamatic before. The Battlecruisers in game are a tad smaller
I think you are supposed to see each individual unit as like an entire army or something
Gameplay just trumps flavor. 
MtG calls it the elephant in boots problem. 
How do you put an elephant in the refrigerator
I didn’t know slack could do spoilers. 
lol I made a bot a while back that put everything drew said in a spolier
we have it on Wayfair as well
Oh, it doesn’t show the same display name. 
yeah not sure where the name comes from
seems to be the username
Would've been a nice feature before I got SC 2 spoilers
But that's on me and my absurd history with this franchise
In my defense HotS was released in 2013. 
WAIT WTF?
HOW IS THAT A SPOILER?!!??!
Was working on an issue today, and we wanted to run the solution by somebody on B2b, so the dude I was working with tossed out a name to ping on slack.
Halfway through typing my message, I realized that the name he tossed out was an L8 (VP)
decided they probably had better things to worry about
lol
exActly
Absolutely. Hence that's on me. After x number of years, getting spoiled is more and more on the person who has not seen/played the thing
I haven't ever beaten Brood War. And I've only played like the first 3 missions of Wings of Liberty
I...... you worry me
I mean at this rate it's never going to be a spoiler for you because you'll never get there
Yeah, I know
I picked up StarCraft the HD re-release, and been working my way through that. Finally making it a priority to get through
ahhhhhhhh
Good shit
Clear I'm going to need updates on what's spoiler and whats not
Actually I can't wait till gaming tech reaches the point that SC2 cinematic are real
But I'm sad that it'll never happen because you'll always be so scrolled out that everything shows up as little icons
Have you played Planetary Annihilation? You can do super large battles. Like consuming multiple planets at once. 
Yea, I'm super pissed that they made another one
Another PA?
Or another SC?
Another PA
I'm sad to see what's become of Blizzard
I didn’t know they made another Planetary Annihilation. 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_Annihilation>
But they charge just as much for the expansion as the base game.....
Legacy of the Void did that. 
Both are standalone. 
Ehhhhhhh, Blizzard funded vs. kickstarter funded
Did you ever play Gray Goo?
Also full SP campaigns vs. jack diddly
Only ever saw it, never played it
Any good?
I remember liking it, but it’s been a while since I’ve thought about it. 
I miss the golden ago of RTS
what has become of blizzard?
Generals was SOOOO MUCH FUN!
C&amp;C generals
hell yeah
I still have that game
I want to LAN party with it
RTS was one genera I never really enjoyed
AoE2 all the way. 
AoE2 was good, but I liked Generals: Zero Hour much better
I was a big fan of the Sc2 and Warcraft 3 custom games though
Basically what everyone expected, Activision took over and now they're profit crazed anti gamer assholes
Hence the whole fracas with HK and china
AoD game modes were really fun too
I can still hear it in my head
It all went down hill after the Diablo Mobile App was announced
"China will grow larger"
AoD?
Art of Defense
For the record you got atleast person whos in for some C&amp;C Zero Hour
basically a team of real people online vs a scripted map that spawned enemies and had them walk towards stuff or attack your base
if they ever reached a certain end point, everyone's stuff dies/explodes
Ahhhhhhh, in which game?
generals
zero hour
they were custom maps you had to download
neat, I did a little bit of it, but I really got into the actual MP part of it
that was my favorite part of MP
well, that and unlimited money maps
LOL!
No rush 10 mins
Just to watch your computer come to a grinding halt
I had a game where I made a 3 deep layer of emp patriot missiles
LOL!
so many missiles got fired at an AC 130 as it went by
lagged the game real hard
then when they finally caught up to it, they died
LOL!
Air General was my favorite on like a 3v3 map
OH IT WAS GLORIOUS!
I really enjoy jarman kel or however you spell that bullshit
sniping the driver out of china tank generals oversized tanks, then getting them for yourself
LOL!
Every time I hear AC 130 i get flashbacks to MW2
I would also be in for getting a COD group going
I miss those days
Depends on the CoD
true, some were awful
I mean Modern Warfare literally cam out today
Servers are suppose to be complete trash
world at war was awful outside of the zombie mode
Awww dude, I played the shit out of that MP for the win
Servers are always trash on launch
That gun was everything you needed a gun to be
I played a lot of Modern Warfare, Mw2, and World at War
what gun?
PPSH
NOOOOOOO
MP-50 i think?
I played a lot of MW, MW2, Black Ops, Black Ops 2
PPSH was the only gun to use in World at War
that's because the game was garbage
Can't argue with that
MP 40 was the gun to murder with
PPSH you ran out of ammo and it had kick
Used to play One-in-the-chamber a lot on the original Modern Warfare game. We all freaked out when they made it a real gamemode since we made up the rules ourselves
my friends and I got to the high 40s in Nazi zombies though, I think one time we got above 50
MP 40 you could counter snipe with an full auto gun with silence
remember the dual wielded models?
and how OP they were
Don't remember One-in-the-chamber
ugh it was a good day when they nerfed that
one in the chamber was meh
OHHHHH MY GOD that was vicious
gun game and the crossbow one were the best
Yeah we never actually played the real game modes when they came out
Not gonna lie we did a crazy amount of CTF
also, I miss the tac knife with commando
You're one of those assholes
I used to win FFA only knifing people
Run classes in Mw2 were broken as hell
and run classes in Gun Game were just awful
EVERYBODY hated you
I made a PS3 account called "A Knife" just for that purpose
I played it so much I went through a prestige using nothing but secondaries
another handle was "SomeoneBehindYou" for awhile
Remember the stinger missile Explode on death glitch?
ugh
that was awful
Friend had an account `IKnifeForFood`
martyrdom, but extreme
Someone in our group liked the hardcore modes, that was fun once you got use to it
yeah, they were good too
How about the endless care package glitch?
Don't remember that one
don't recall that one
Kill Streaks for DAYS!
Maybe it was Xbox only
I played exclusively on xbox
wasn't there a super fast run speed doing something with a care package grenade?
But you did some stuff you and you got literally infinite care packages
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Sounds pretty neat
That lasted like... 3 days???
sounds dangerous
because EVERY MATCH WAS HARRIERS AND COPTERS EVERYWHERE
at that point, it's just king of the hill
easy to level up the launchers
Great for leveling up Cold Blooded
until somebody gets a 25 killstreak and calls in a nuke
fuck nukes
they were silly
I don't want to end the match when I'm doing that well
I triggered them like 2 or 3 times
I only did when I knew the people I was running with
yeah. Especially since kill streak reward kills counted towards your killstreak
I always waited until the match was close to being over before I triggered
get an AC 130 or Attack Chopper, and you were 90% of the way towards the nuke
Yea, that was Harrier into AC-130 into Nuke
Getting the 7 kills for the harrier was always a bitch
Chopper gunner was good too
I knew a dude back in highschool I would play with sometimes. He would get a damn nuke like every other game
That is way too much effort
My friend was top 1000 for domination
The dude probably spent like 15 hours a day playing the game
he had some serious playtime under his belt
Domination was my favorite gamemode
Mostly because you would generally spwan and know where to run to find an enemy
I will always be sad what they did to CTF in MW2
enemies spawning behind you, or just where you looked away were the worst
FFA was always my favorite
Nah I liked the Team modes better
I don't think I every played CTF
Once you grabbed the flag everyone knew where you were
I just liked killing everyone faster than everyone
So it was straight sprinting
plus then I can play against my friends
Where as in WoW you had to have the radar to see the flag carrier
much more satisfying to beat your friends then win as a team
And if they had the stealth perk it was hide and go seek
especially when it's close
I preferred team games when your friends were on the opposite team.
over a full FFA
LOL!
though that was harder to set up
yeah, but that's very difficult to set up
you needed to join their game when their team was full
and it had to be in progress
Yea...... if I joined the other team I got told to stop kicking their asses
and have a slot open on the opposing team
yeah but the "oh shit that was you get r3kt kid" moment when you killed a random enemy moments made it worth it
I'll never forget, our group played against a different group, and one of their guys ended up on our side. And he's like "you guys are great, you protect the flag carrier rather than watch him die and try to cap it yourself"
LOL!
heh, remember the days of noob tube?
ugh
yes
Another of my friends got IMMEDIATELY triggered and went full freakout mode very time he got killed by one
Noob tube with the changing class for infinite noob tubing
My favorite is when you killed someone with a direct hit
yeah, that was fun
You ever play with those glitch lobbies where there was like 40 people in a FFA on the smallest map?
I think my favorite kills were when I killed someone with a flash/stun grenade
No can't say that I did
I never got those, since I never used flash/stun grenades
It took us way to long to realize that's what happened
I didn't use them often, but getting impact kills with them or actual kills from the stun explosion was the most fun to hear people yell about
"those can kill you?"
That's fine, I brought up this topic, it isn't surprising we got into this territory
Diablo 3 I think was a bit of a sign of things to come
Sad Panda
asdf
Diablo 3 was great
People should stop putting cinnamon in food
uhh.. why?
Cinnamon definitely has a place in some foods
like tres leches cake
because not it just reminds me of candles and room freshener and i do not want my food to taste like candles
1. Stop eating candles; you shouldn't know what they taste like
2. Buy candles that don't smell like cinnamon, get ones that smell like something other than food
3. ???
4. Profit
But cinnamon is so good is desserts!
Can I suggest maybe people should stop putting cinnamon in candles?
i will defer you to the amazingness of the spice that is cadamom
Cardamom is also good. 
Multiple things can be good. 
i dont like cinnamon in my food :cry:
can we make cardamom candles?
then maybe ill like cinnamon more
I am not a cardamom fan. I'll happily side with cinnamon on this one
Let’s just have you eat candles. 
I got really into these back in SC 1. I actually learned about things like Tower Defense from things like Corsair Defense and what not.
I'm with Brenden.... Aysh you should not be eating Cinnamon scented candles. The vanilla ones are much better
Candlelit dinners taking on a different meaning. 
the cinnamon goes better with charred wicks
That is very true doug

Fair warning, she's very new to slack, so don't put her in the bots yet
I feel that might be a tad overwhelming
I’m also not on the bots, a fact which I enjoy.

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1904_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_marathon>
^this is a great story. Everyone should take a minute to read this if you’re not familiar with the 1904 St. Louis marathon. 
You mean of how fucked up shit was 100 years ago? Great how?
It’s just the best story. There are like 8 different ways the one event was terrible. 
&gt; This was a disappointment, as many observers were sure Len Tau could have done better if he had not been chased nearly a mile off course by aggressive dogs.
And that line isn’t even the highlight. 
But I mean it's all racist insanity, "forced dehydration" its classic turn of the century "science" for science sake
Yup. 

And not just racist insanity. One guy just stopped to eat rotten apples! So many insanities.

slack said its too large
you can resize a gif or compress it a bit
I'm still sad you made it - instead of _

I was the one who made that function, it annoyed brenden so much he found it and changed it from _ to -
because brenden really hates _
I like that he didn't turn it off
Just modified it

What's the frequency?
It works when I make it 1
there is a limit to how much effort i put into things
:perfect:
You've just been getting lucky
What was it before?
It's back to normal
....
Which is?????
5%
or 1 in 20
I don't know the probability math on how lucky it is to miss a 5% chance over X instances
Or how it's a better than 50% chance 2 people have the same birthday if you have 30 something people at an event
I mean these odds are easy because it's just multiplicative because they're independent events
So .95*x for you not to trigger
So over 100 times I get 95... That doesn't really tell me quite what I'm looking for
There is a 0.005% chance of 100 of your messages in a row NOT being scrambled
CJ it is an exponent, not multiplier
.95^100
which seems weird since .95^20 = a 35% chance that your messages do not get scrambled 20 times in a row
and 60% chance to have been scrambled after 10
Yea what Dakota said
I mean that makes sense because it should trigger every 20 messages
I was never good at wrapping my head around stats
I just pretend I know what I'm doing and generally it's good enough
Once you start getting into combinations, permutations and all the other fancy functions is where I start getting lost
and the birthday thing is crazy, though I sit next to somebody who shares my birthday so I guess it is more likely than i would think
Generally it's just a fancy way to write out P1*P2*P3....*PN
you know cause math and physics is all about what is *_the laziest_* way to do something
6p2 and 6c2 have fancy formulas behind them
it's not as simple as multiplying them
Yea no.... it really is, they use n!/(n-p)! to write out (n)*(n-1)*(n-2)..*(n-(p-1))
which is different from `( P1*P2*P3....*PN)`
Yes and no, this is a specialized case where all probabilities are equal, but each instances removes a degree of freedom
Seriously Dakota, you can summarize all math as `Be as creative as possible to solve this in a few steps as possible because we're lazy`
step 1: Plug it into wolfram alpha
that's how I got through college
Step 2: if it is not in wolfram alpha, pray it is in the back of the book
Step 3: Cry at midterms
lol
Really glad I never had to do diffeq
diff eq still has my favorite theorem to date
Never learned it. I heard it is ahrd
`If the equation has these conditions and you can find an answer it is the right answer`
Generally it's hard because you can't "solve" for an answer
There's no `Do this steps till you get to the end`
Stats has really been the only math that has been marginally useful in my life ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It's more like `Try this till you think it's failed, then go back to the start and try this instead`
sounds awful
Calculus and vector math are super useful, down side is no one else can see that
Ohhhh I mean it's full on bitch work to do by hand
When have you actually applied those to real-life situations
Honestly, a lot in my work, it's all pattern recognition
Vector math?
When was the last time I cracked out a derivative or integral, forever ago.  Know what shape I would get if I did that super useful
Most probability curves are cum curves, so vector math helps you identify what the underlying probabilities look like
Eh i see how techinically recognizing those kinda curves and getting meaning from them does count, I just don't really associate that type of skill with _doing_ the math
It's where I learned to do that stuff ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Like I have seen/used logarithmic scales and such, i just don't really see that as using calculus
or didn't. I suppose it makes sense now
:fuuuu:
I could have gone my whole life without realizing calculus was helpful, but no
whats this favorite theorem?
HAHAHAHAHAHA you started this
`If the equation has these conditions and you can find an answer it is the right answer`
Technically if you want to get really fancy it's this <https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~tyson/existence.pdf>
`<http://illinois.edu|illinois.edu>`?!?!?!!?
It came up in google first
that's my college
Calc and stats have been equally useful to me. Calc was a revelation in high school because it finally made sense of the last 3 years of math in terms of practical application
I have no idea how HS Calc made math make sense
I don't know where my head is at

Malicious compliance is the act of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly following orders or rules, knowing that compliance with the orders or rules will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order or rules’s intent but follows its letter. It is usually done to injure or harm while maintaining a sense of legitimacy.

On a side note for those who played League, URF mode is back

FANCY
Basically doug, all of the <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> trouble makers have bots that haunt us, this is dakota's
League of Legends: Ultra Rapid Fire mode. 80% coolsown reduction
oh he meant prometheus
lol
yup, I know URF
gotcha. Sometimes that bot will also ping drew.
You know for extra evil!
I miss old malzahar in urf
where you could do an AD build for the minions
I played a team yesterday consisting of
Trynd
Jax
Malz
Sion
(dont remember)

all they did was rush down towers and we lost horribly
yup, URF is not really balanced.
malz is stupid for taking out towers
so are Sion and Trynd
since trynd cant die, and sion intentionally dies for massive damage
I mean I miss old tarric, unkillable stun bot
"unkillable"
all you needed was range
old eve, old shen, old taric were all great
old eve was hilarious
old taric was the worse.
old taric in urf had infinite stun
click stun was so un-fun
I like ARURF
that way you can't pick broken teams
you can only get lucky
ARURF was more balanced, and more fun when you got to play broken champs against bad ones
but I also like being able to just pick the champs I like
I miss the old galio
and using his ult with mark/dash
when the enemy team didn't have a garen
My current favorites are Twitch, Nocturn, Malphite and Skarner
skarner is kind of boring
but he's really good
twitch is very polar
I don't love malph
nocturn is pretty great
oh and rumble
hes fun
he still has cooldowns though
so there's that
nah
he can cast spells during overheat
The board-wide darkness is so thematic. so few champions can pull off that kind of experiance
oh
that's weird
originally he couldn't but he was so bad as a result
yeah, that moment of panic: "Is it me?"
Rumble can cast during overheat? That's new. kidn of defeats the purpose of overheat
probably only during URF
yeah only during urf
What should I do for lunch today? :start_a_thread:
Fooda options suck
I enjoy playing the "just mash your keyboard" champs in urf
cuz I'm not good enough to play mechanically intensive champs
so..., nunu
alright "just mash your keyboard and still kill shit"
nunu is garbage
I can kill people with nunu snowballs
well yeah, but nunu doesn't faceroll people
fair
he's like a less sneaky version of the old even
with way less damage
eve was just stupidly broken
just spam faster
i think the snowball is still like a full second cooldown
no idea if new eve is good
false
not the big snowball
the small ones
wait, THEY CHANGED NUNU
yeah
lol
nunu isn't trash in urf anymore
Damn it i'll have to try him
does nunu-bot still have the same laugh?
<https://youtu.be/BqFypepdSVc?t=3>
Ohhh Brenden with old taric you could self heal for HP and AP at 1.2 ratio, so even ranged character had a problem chipping him down
And once you got in stun range GG
hmmm it does go on cooldown though apparently in the video
the mini snowballs?
oh wait i was lookin gat wrong skill
I DON"T KNOW AND I CAN"T DECIDE!
I'm thinking sushi
I'm debating on heading to china town for some actual bon me
Too far I'm too lazy
Krave is really good if you're going to china town
it's only a short orange line ride away
so it looks like you have 3 seconds of seemingly infinite casting before it goes on cooldown for 3 seconds
I guess, I generally walk everywhere so if I want lunch from weird places I should take the T more
jetblue is offering $31 one way flights on halloween from/to anywhere in the US
too bad I'M ALREADY FLYING THAT DAY ON JETBLUE FOR MORE MONEY
LOL!
soooo much anger
Ohhhh way better
WHOA
brb taking a day trip to vegas
I did a new emoji thing
that's some interesting data
It would be more interesting over a period &gt; 1 week
perhaps a rolling month?
it seems to only want to fetch 1000 messages at a time, so 1 week was just the easy MVP
can you filter which 1000 messages you get?
perhaps by date?
you can specify between dates, and the endpoint gives you a token to retrieve the next set of messages as well
Would it be possible for Jeeves to point out when a emote is posted by one of us?
Now that I have made the proof of concept though I've kinda lost interest in expanding it more. I'll put the script in a thread on this message if you want to expand.
:travolta:
in wayfair slack?
This is capitalized like a book title. 
It would have to be along the lines of "every X minutes, Look at channel Y grab the messages from the last X minutes. If one of us posted something, send an api request for this channel"
In chaos monkey. 
Like in the daily list. 
posted as in uploaded?
I don’t know if author info is attached. 
oh yeah author is included
check out `csn_junk.dbo.tblWayfairEmoji` on DEVC10
Ideally the script would also filter out megamojis or treat them as one, since they kinda screw with things
```hubotAPP [5:11 PM]
was added to #nonwork-activism by Brenden Bourdeau.```
the potential for trolling
same with #nonwork-politics
and #nonwork-bos
and #nonwork-random
and #nonwork-emoji
Where does the Jeeves code live?
and now #help-no-stupid-questions
well it's been in emoji for a while
Jeeves is prometheus
well it uses prometheu's bot token to call the slack api directly
the code only exists on my computer and executes daily at 11:30
I posed the script in <#CDU145F08|megamoji_test_channel>  a couple days ago in a thread if you are interested
yep, I've now successfully run it as well
today is really annoying
I've got issues trying to run something locally, that I have no idea how to diagnose
booooo
My error messages make it sound like all our dev kafka brokers are down or I'm pointed at the wrong hostnames

i would offer to help, but the mart genes skipped a generation
so if you're already able to check the author of each emote, then you could add an array of our usernames, then just add a little star or something when one comes up that we authored.
Summon the Silent
I'm sad no one responded to this, NOW YOU SHALL ALL SUFFER!
Summon the slient
Summon the Silent
I was thinking about it, but I am having trouble conceptualizing what Godlike powers over a group of people would mean
Ability to do whatever you wanted, bend reality to your will
yeah, but do I experience the reality as well?
I.e am i messing with a copy of earth, but with nobody I know?
and can I fly on said earth?
I'll pass on the god like powers thanks
Yes and yes
or am i limited to messing with the people, without interacting with them
No
So basically: you are given a VR version of earth with Sandbox Mode Enabled
Sure
Do I gotta worry about my health and eating and sleeping and stuff?
No, you're a god
`God like powers over a world of people` does not necessarily mean you are any more than human
You can eat for the experience not the sustenance
How???
What you thinking god like powers over a colony of ant sized people?
Power over a world of people does not mean you are
A) physically there
B) have any control over your world
I disagree with the B)
It depends on how the control mechanism works
like, what if to intercact with the other world, you closed your eyes and thought about the other world
and some settings to play with
Like If I wasn't part of the world I have godlike powers over, I would probably think it not real
I think in this context it's more monotheism rather than polytheism in which you are omnipotent and omnipresent
At that point there is no You
the point is you have power over the world with nothing but you current mental capability
I imagine you would not have awareness of everythign going on in that world, or even the ability to have a distinct physical presense
like, if I didn't have a body in that world, I probably wouldn't care
and eventually get bored
and then probably blow everything up
assuming I could undo it
I mean there's no reason you couldn't physically manifest yourself as well
Depends on what that does to your actual body
and the relitive flow of time
If I can put my full conciousness into a physical body in the other world, and time doesn't pass in the real world, than the other world will become my real world, cuz why would I come back?
lol
talk about meta-physics dakota
That is why I am assuming there are limits to the power, and a layer of separation between you and the other world you have power over
I think the intent was more that we wouldn't torture the fuck out of people we know
Like if you were god, and you don't have a connection with the people
Do you essential get bored and give up like you suggested
Or do you cause them to have raging wars for your amusement
If I'm in the world, I would probably just mostly live as a human for a while
then when that gets old,  i would probably start seeking other worlds
because if I exist with power over a world, there are probably others
I almost feel like we should give you more power because you have no interest in abusing it
I'm really unambicious
<@UDL020K8D> you seem the more philosophical type do you have more opinion than Dakota
I think my priorities would be as follows:

Improve my memory and sight
Figure out Control of Time, Teleportation, Flight, Invisibility, and the ability to use said powers without anybody thinking twice
Live life with those powers until i'm bored. I'd probably do a lot of vigilante justice and that sorta thing.
Explore space
Then maybe find more immortals
I would almost certainly leave the world I have control over to it's own devices
hell, I probably wouldn't even step in to deal with national level crap. Just deal with people who piss me off personally
and A LOT of petty revenge on assholes
I mean.... how are we defining petty revenge?
like, dudes an asshole, so i'll mess with his inner ear so he has poor balance for the rest of his life
LOL!
or curse him so his left shoe NEVER fits right again
I will curse them with unending minor inconveniences and
this is a great thread; I haven't yet read it all; I was in a meeting
Totally missed that CJ pinged me. Are we still talking about Aysh’s god problem?
I think the answer is that no matter what you’d end up so lonely that you’d destroy everything. 
you all always have the long conversations when I'm in a meeting and blow up my phone
I don't feel bad, you guys did that too me earlier today
I think I would be more likely to just leave the world then destroy it
After a point, power is insanely toxic to humans. A poison like any other. 
Yes, but before the incessant boredom what would you do?
yeah but this is beyond power, this is an entire different level of existence
Can I be a lesser god in a pantheon? That’d be a lot more fun. 
hell yeah that would be fun
also dangerous as fuck
I call trickster god. 
they're funny, but almost always hated or disliked
Sooo basically what I'm getting out of this, is that no one wants to be omnipower they all want limitaions
Anansi was well liked. 
omnipower is boring
whats the point?
With onmipower, I would probably just ignore 90% of it
I want to be somewhere in the middle of Anansi and Loki. 
Assume free will exists
Maybe more like Oberon. 
Your pawns make decisions independent of your influence
I don't want to be known as a god
It'd be like setting up dominoes and shit
Right, basically I’d just be a DM. 
and my pawns wouldn't be pawns. more like ducks in a pond
lol!
You and your party find yourselves turned into elks. What do you do?
I'm still of the opinion I would end up like bender no matter the power you give me
Make a store somewhere, Call it VR, and then do real DM stuff
handwave the realism with claims it is new technology
that could be fun
HAHAHAHAHA
I wouldn't want to pick random people off the street and force them to adventure
Yes, do that Dakota. Like I’d totally pull a Q and just put Picard in a bunch of puzzles at inopportune times. 
make them come to you and volunteeer, they just don't know it's real
Would you expose them to real danger Dakota?
So yes....
oh hell yeah
but I'd bring them back to life
You put them in enough danger to force Thor to show up. 
and make the actual memories of pain and such foggy
What about you Doug, would you let your involuntary participants permanently die?
maybe dull dull pain sense
Clearly mortals are just pawns in the games gods play. What player would not sacrifice a knight to take a king?
Ok, I’ve changed my mind slightly, I want to be in the middle of Anansi and Lex Luthor 
You offer another service for having super powers in new york. They go on a rampage "it's just VR"
and you undo all the damage
until one day, you dont
I don't know what to do with the 2 of you
Well, you get to play the hero god then. 
Doug is "I want to watch the minions fight for my pleasure"
Dakota is "I want my minions to have super powers to watch!"
Not fight, so banal. 
I mean, it would interesting to see what people would do when they have superpowers
Give them superpowers with fatal flaws. 
I was just about to ask, given both of you want to be in a Pantheon what do you do if they introduce an arch-nemesis with the same powers
Oh, can I be the devil from Something Wicked This Way Comes?
Don't actually know that reference doug
CJ, are they using their omnipotant powers to make themselves a minor god in a pantheon?
cuz you could introduce your own nemisis then
You totally do, you just might not know the name. Old guy sells you the thing you want, but there is a ironic curse. 
classic genie in a bottle?
The nemesis should not have the same powers. The powers reflect the ideology. The hero is straightforward, the trickster fights obliquely 
I mean it could be spy vs spy
Superman vs Mr mxyzptlk
But I was more referring to immortality and other things
Eh, Poseidon and Zeus found enough things to fight over. 
Basically I’m saying I’d spend all my time playing board games and D&amp;D. Just a lot more people would be affected.
CJ you never said what you would do
Clearly he’s just going to try and stop us. 
<@UHQD9J1SL> how about you?
I could be the BBEG for your 'parties' you plan on DMing for
I would find that amusing
So Brenden is god of Shadow, Dakota, god of conflict, Doug, god of struggle, Aysh, god of chaos. 
CJ god of valor. 
woah, why shadows
As long as I can curse people I don't like with minor inconveninces
Eh, that’s what I thought for for BBEG. 
like: Usb will never fit until you flip them twice
well you're not the head of the pantheon, you don't get to tell me my domain
what if I want to be the god of portals, or death, or undeath?
portals?
yeah, why not
my domain is every doorway, plus all inplanar travel
sounds good to me
doorways sounds better
Sounds like Janus has the right of it
plus, people can't go without doorways
Weird BBEG, but ok. Oh, I just you are the guardian, none returns to their old life without proving themselves to the doorman. 
I could feel slighted by some important royalty or something
and want to sow chaos
or get revenge
imagine every door you try to unlock, you end up locking it first
or the key always goes in the opposite way you remembered
I could make every door you enter not lead where you intend
Are we referring to what I would do as a god, or what i would do in our pantheon?
Dakota and Aysh upset the status quo, I set the stage, CJ inspires the hero to rise to the occasion and prove himself to Brenden. 
Both
good luck reaching me in my place of power, I control travel
That depends on if gods need a physical medium for travel
yeah, but we're talking about CJ the adventurer
or if they can just pop into existence wherever they want
Every video game has some way to reach the boss. I have to make sure my quandary is solvable. Though certainly not easy. 
As a god, i refer to Futrama's "GodFellow's" at the start of this thread
if they ever find me, I just open a portal to the elemental plane of fire under them
As a member of this pantheon, I can't believe you guys think I'm a good guy
anyway, I'm heading home
so I likely won't be responding much in the near future
man, two long threads today
im so lost, please start over!
So many trap doors!
also, Dakota- youre God, you dont need to ask questions
Unless you’re the god of questions. 
Basically this thread devolved into everyone being a god and playing :dnd: with mortals
Hmmm $13
Good will?
I remember that game. Really wanted it to be a full 3D Pokémon. It was not. 
Yea :(
Why have they never full a full console Pokémon game? WHY??????
You do now, sword and shield
Oh yeah. 
I hope it’s good. The giant Pokémon look dump. 
I don't like the fact its pokedex specific
I took a pass on let's go Pikachu and Eevee. I'm not sure I'll be able to resist sword/shield
I bought the console... It didn't even come with power cords but I couldn't resist
Last one I played was X/Y
Same
GameCube is really solid. Lot of good games on it. 
Go play Luigi’s Mansion and get hyped about Luigi’s Mansion 3 coming out tomorrow. 
going to play some urf this evening
add me `Beerdeau`
i've been looking to buy a gamecube or wii with gc support for years
Wii will likely be cheaper
likely
You could probably pick up one on eBay for like $10
Backwards compatibility for the win!
nunu is as hilarious as I remembered
definitely the new eve
<@UDC4QL95G> join us on league
Yeah I haven't used my GameCube in ages because my Wii has the backward capability
True that I till have both
Good Morning everyone!
Summon the Silent

I don't see a deja vu icon. why did we get the brenden bot?

it is a bug we never bothered to fix
kafka bo1 is not happy this morning
super not good
Happy Halloween
That seems super broken
What's it responsible for?
eh, I don't think this card has ever seen any real competitive play
having to wait 2 turns for the effect is a big downside
True
I assume competitive decks are faster, this would belong in a heavy minion control deck at best (which probably doesn't exist)
in the formats this is legal in you can do a lot more powerful things.
like turn 1 kills are possible.
Too many things to count
man this   Quarterly Event is even more dissappointing than i thought
The halloween lunch is basically "everybody gets free fooda today"
and last time this happened, they ran out of food
yup
"here's lunch, go back to work"
I expect long lines
yup. first my pod outing,now this
Lets do a walkout
free food!!
CJ go get free food early
Why did I book a 11:30 meeting ugh 
No Dakota, if you want better stuff you need to Unionized
That's much scary than a walkout
lines on boyl 3 were crazy
Lines on 9 weren't that bad
We have a 9? 
In bolyston
yeah food was alright. Back to work i guess?
I guess
Boring
Although I'm working tonight, so not sure I'm laughing
I'M LAUGHING!!!
Well that's nightmare fodder
I mean Victoria, if you haven't seen gremlins you need too
Nope, not gonna happen
how was the free food
It was fine it was fooda which they usually have
It was just the better restaurants
I don't know why people don't like Gremlins it's hilarious
I think it's because they look creepy
And they multiply if you feed them incorrectly
They multiple when you get them wet
Then what happens when you feed them after midnight?
They start as that, and become the other creatures when you feed them incorrectly
And isn't always after midnight?
yes
Well the wet is any time
they were making channels for people based on first names
Awww it's already gone I was going to join it good buddy
yeah I archived the channel right after taking the screenshot
Ah, just missed getting on a new orange line train again. 
Awwwww that sucks
It is. Need to revisit those movies
<@UDC03KCGK> have you played that game since?
Not yet just because we've only had one game night since then.
:stuck_out_tongue:
<@UDDE5960N> are you ok
Clearly CJ has declared this a bad morning. 
Good morning! <@UDDE5960N>
He typically has Race games caught up on during the commute, and he started 3 new games with me last night, so the fact that only Doug had caught up this morning clearly means he's dead... <@UETS9HTSS> too
hm, my slack instances are out of sync. This one has a formatting line now, WF slack doesn't.
<@UDC03KCGK> my phone didn't tell me I had new games I'll get on them
Late train plus early morning meetings means no slack
Good Morning!
<@UDL020K8D> you'll be happy to know I have brought in `Dead of Winter` today
OHHH THE NEW SLACK IS WEIRD IT CHANGES IN MESSAGE BOX!!!!
Oh right Brenden is in Colorado
Yea he's high and drunk right now, call back in like 3 days
The weed is much better there than here in MA
Not a clue
:virgin: :thinking_fb:
I'm in denver
So 9am is 7am
Eh, my family is in PST so I'm used to it. Just forgot you were in Denver
Try again
Oh fuck
My family is in PST, so I'm used to it. Just forgot you were in Denver.
Ahh that makes more sense
Who else is with you in Denver <@UETS9HTSS>?
Dakota what is in your horde or games at work?
Uhhh
every game I own?
lol
Except blood rage
Which are...?
you want to me to manually type out my entire boardgame collection from memory?
Go

Are you in the office or home today?
home
I was in the office earlier, but am working the second half of they day from home
Explains that you can't play tonight
How does that explain it?
We could all go over to his place!
I'm down for that. Raid on Dakota's!
Lol Nah I got other plans tonight
I would have totally been down going back to boyl/cop or somebody else's place otherwise
hell i'm already 3/4 of the way to drews :lol:
*sigh* Dakota has other friends/a date
:zoidberg_sigh:
You should bring them? Or bring us!
More of a promise to play games with people over the internet kinda thing
So not really possible
Got tired off seeing that Total Recall gif
I am the President of wifi
I don’t know what that means. 
:)
I've given up on the chaos goddess's nonsensical sayings to be honest
I’m not going to give up so easily. 
I feel like I need to spend more time with Aysh in person in order to understand her chaos.
Orange line is weird. 
Nice you ride in the back?
Shotgun!
Well that's a new one
:disappointed-but-not-surprised:
That doesn't seem like an efficient way to transfer commuter traffic.
You're confusing amusing with useful, this keeps commuter spirits high

I broke my phone
We broke the Aysh bot again
Oof. 
I think this will require more than just a reboot :(
When are you getting a new phone?
Ouchie
I - the person who has an extra set of clothes at my work desk in case i spill coffee on myself- carried my older (also cracked but less so) phone (the one I was using 2 weeks ago before I bought this *RIP*) in case this ran out of battery.
So thankfully, I am ok for this week
Im hoping I can replace the screen instead of having to buy and set up a new phone (which is a process I detest)
Also- I love how my phone was taking phantom touches and sending you all messages and you immediately assumed I was doing it on purpose. I can die a little bit more at peace, knowing this

nooooooooo its $29 per game
for 5 games
Clearly I'm not going to play 20% of a game Aysh!
no but you try one and then see if you like it enough and then try the others
Well technically, yes, she smashed a keyboard for a while.
Aggressive summon the silent call there by you CJ
Exactly!

Good Morning!

I dont like mine . I doesnt have a tune to it.
No it does not
You should tell doug they need to rhyme
not necessary but they need to have good cadence. number of syllables
You could also code it out if you wanted to
Good morning!
If they have too much cadence then it’s less discomforting.

Yeah, definitely copy/paste there. 
or perhaps I lack motivation
Well today I'm bored
I'm blocked by an issue that I don't really know enough to diagnose

it's already on fire

<!here> Is there a ski trip group happening?
I want there to be
Is there a thing for it? I'd like to go
I'm not sure what you mean by 'a thing for it'
<@UDC03KCGK> apparently I need to submit a group for the ski trip lottery by 5pm today
current group is:
Me
Kosta
Dave
You
still interested?
Thursday February 20th – Sunday February 23rd
to Sugarloaf
Why can't everyone respond to a ping within 5 minutes... :sweat:
<@UDBGH9BMX> you've been silent for so long; welcome back
Ty
Is there still beef jerky here?
I haven't made any for a hot sec
well that's quite the depressing :dejavu:
<@UDC4QL95G> what's the lookback period on dejavu
Forever
Or basically till we started doing it
Now that's funny order
I want in on the ski trip thing.... but Mei might murder me
So I'm glad I was super busy today until after it was submitted so I didn't have to make a decision
yeah literally forever
When I orginally typed it `forever` came first
there is a big text doc with the channel history
It is also how the daily ban is decided
I decided last time I went on a ski trip that skiing is not for me
As much as I'd enjoy the the weekend, I'll have to past
though it's past 5pm so too late anyway
Well we might be appending it
Cause someone else I know wants to go
What did you end up doing? Was at work so couldn't check my phone
There's room for you
If you can't come, I'll find someone to replace you
Submitted a lottery submission as a group of 5
Sweet! Yeah I'd definitely come. Sam probably not
I've literally tried for this ski group like 4 years running now. We'll see if it happens at all haha
Well fuck you too Prometheus
"I've tried to apply for this ski trip for 4 years running now. We'll see if it actually happens this year haha"
But... Can you?
<@UETS9HTSS> did you see the message I posted in Wayfair about the trip?
:evil:
No?

So found out I'm terrible at Hearts
I feel like that was a game I found on the computer when I was little and thought the objective was to score as many points as possible
I’m kind of off Hearts. It’s way too snowball-y at the end. 
I found out I am terrible with Hearts.
Oh I love hearts, if you have a good strategy, it's easy to destroy people
Snowbally?
How in the world is hearts snowbally?
at like the 3/4 mark, one person will often be stuck in a loop where they will win all the remaining hands.
because they landed on the wrong suite
oh, you mean within each hand
yeah, but that's part of the strategy
you're trying to either take all the cards, or very few
true, but the best way to win is not always fun. and when I find that I play other things.
you can sometimes get rid of the lead to another person
so you just don't find hearts fun is what you're saying
in both for me
Well I'm special and you guys are all screwed!

It may be a bug with the original summon the silent being replaced? you tell slack to post in a thread by giving the request the ID of a message to add the thread to. if the original message is in the process of being deleted, the api probably gets a bit confused
But this thread wasn't deleted
Nor does it go off when I get bot replaced
*usually*
I am guessing it tried to respond to the bot Summon the SIlent
Maybe, but why don't I see that
you are insane
True
I don't see any of this
I anti hallucinate things
BOOM ME AND BRENDEN ARE SPECIAL TOGETHER!
Well then, you discovered this recently?

The fact it happened back to back is the scariest part.
Imagine if you had typed it out by hand all 3 times
I did have to twice
Copy pasted the 3rd one
yeah you wised up the third time. message came far too quick
or second time I should say
I found it quite fun. One of those white whales for me to chase: "I finally did it, I won Hearts against people who knew what the fuck they were doing."
I have a copy of 7 Wonders that someone just brought over and left for me. I don't plan to ever play it (7 Wonders Duel works quite well for Sam and me). 
Does anyone want it?
speaking of free games, cj remind me to bring you your copy of race for the galaxy
So <@UDBGH9BMX> do you actually want it, or did you just want to use that emoji as an "Oh wow, free game party!"
Ugh, Dave did you want the game, or just wanted to use the emoji again as a "Look free game, freak out!"
Wait, so how did we get multiple going?
The ugh was directed at the scrambler bot
What's the srambler bot frequency at currently?
5% you always ask that
It's just been particularly frequent today, so I was checking it wasn't stuck on the testing protocol you used before.
What's the emoji spam set at?
What's the emoji spam set at?
random chance. My DnD game last night I crit by first two rolls.
Sure, but this has been closer to 33% today

I picked up a copy from goodwill for $299
Oh right that
Oh right that

:wave:
That’s creepy AF
Your's is really creepy
Why are there so many bots now? And I'd heard good things about the game so I'd be interested in it if you don't have any use for it, but if someone wants it more, by all means they can have it
I knew I should have waited longer...
:wave_cat:
TIL: If you are browsing wayfair, there is a chance that a customer service agent will call you to help you shop.
call?
like they will ring you up on the phone?
Yea boston globe article about it a week ago
Some people like it
Some people find it invasive
that is the creeeeeeeeeepiest thing ever.
For the record it's things considered "hard to shop" like flooring
they should at least start with a chat. Chat windows popping up on websites is pretty common
then they could ask, "Would a phone call be helpful?"
why do that when you can just call out of nowhere "hey I see you are browsing my website"
because not everyone wants to admit they live in the panopticon.

This does not change the fact that we live in the panopticon, we just don't have to admit to that reality just yet.
This is a very creep word
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon#:~:targetText=The%20panopticon%20is%20a%20type,Bentham%20in%20the%2018th%20century>.
Yea I went and looked it up
blame Jeremy Bentham
I think you're missing the fact that you expect people to understand how much info they're giving up
But the short answer is people are tech illiterate.  Most people know how to use things, but now how they work example car, bike
Didn't the article say a representative of the site said the call and browsing was just a coincidence?
over the past 24 hours, I wrote SQL that takes in JSON as an input, and outputs JSON after processing
this feels weird
I feel like this should be done in a different language
yup
probably should be
the problem was that we need to input an arbitrary number of parameters to sql
so I took in JSON
since it's for an API endpoint anyway
That just sounds wrong on so many levels
A python wrapper would have made life so much easier
my team just moved from SQL to Mongo and everything is great now.
Like Mongo DBs? Or some sort of other Mongo?
yeah, MongoDB
why do you like it better
I haven't worked with it
I thought MongoDB ran off SQL?
Or is it NoSQL?
NoSQL
its a document storage schema, not relational table based
so it stores different things.
Ahhhh, that's why Mongo is familiar
For our purposes its great, and all the syntax is trivial.
Also Mongo is a character from _Blazing Saddles_
Ohhhh Mongo
Such a good movie Doug
&gt; Mongo just pawn in game of life.
Anyone not feel like working and wanna hang 
Going for the ultrasound later today
does that tell you gender?
Yes! This one does at least
Richard are you in Boyl or Copley?
Do you want to know the gender?
Will you tell us the gender?
Yes sure

Everyone's a critic.  Poor Doug
Good morning! I'm practically working a 9-5 this week based on my schedule
I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing
that means he has evenings free!
But I feel like he makes more money not having free evenings
Actually no, because of a quirk of pooling tips
There's more hours in the morning shift, so I get a larger proportion of the pay
Unfortunately no, I get out late tonight, we already have plans tomorrow, Wednesday is date night, I work Thursday and Friday night, then Saturday I have a Friendsgiving after.
I know where the code is now, I can fix it
Or fuck it up horribly
Guess we'll find out which :devious_patrick:
That feels.... wrong....?
#lateStageCapitalism
:chaos::chaos::chaos:
Why is this late stage capitalism?
This just seems like silly distrubtion
Or are you referring the fact that they need tips to have a living wage
well, also that last point.

I was thinking about the cycle of spending more time for more money, which is only really useful if you have time not working, etc.
Isn't that just life though? You try to maximize your value add time so you can be lazy as possible?
not always. There is a societal push to monetize that sort of destroys non-working life.
I'm sort of thinking along the lines of:
<https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/meritocracys-miserable-winners/594760/>
I would argue this is the problem with people being externally motivated and "there's never enough"
Man, what's with all the sevs lately
it does feel like a lot
Probably people trying to get code in before freeze
:allthethings:
I hadn't seen nor heard mention of hearts in probably years, but within a week of playing this happens
baader-meinhof phenomenon
most likely
though in this case, the game is rare enough that it is possible I really haven't seen anything about it in a year or two
I mean, the early bar sets up everything for the late bar crew. So they do more customer work and we do more of the prep and set up. If you break the pool in two, the incentives aren't there to make the late crew have a good shift...and vice versa
any interest in picking up one of these for game nights?

:see_no_evil: :speak_no_evil: :hear_no_evil:
Still cheaper than 24 cans of nightshift
I have NO idea what that is
it's a brewery I think
I'll be generous and assume a 4-pack of night shift 16 oz cans is $15
$15*6 = $90
the bottles in there are likely a mix of sizes from 12 oz to 24 oz
we're looking at around $4.17 per bottle in that box
We could split it like 5ways, but I feel like most people in this group haven't had as much beer
At least during game nights I have attended
I mean its pretty much everyone except me and Dakota and he's mostly because of his diet
Good Morning Victoria!
So, no, not cheaper than all that Night Shift. I feel like it is more geared towards someone trying a beer every day for a month, than to a group having a bunch of different beers on a single night
It definitely sounds creepier when I know the person who is posting the message, rather than a bot.
I mean.... It's coming for you Drew
Why are there so many duplicate Emoji's today?
someone thoughtful enough to do alias's
Yea but it's the exact same alias?
for which one?
I don't see any exact duplicates.
cthuwu and cthuwu
halal-guys and halal-guys
one is a dash, the other is an underscore
cthuwu I only see once.
I see both in both
WEIRD!!!!
maybe we have a Jeeves problem
Ohhhh I know what it is
Monday Job went off at 2:30, today's job is 11:30
there's a whole 3 hours of overlap
I still don't get why we're seeing difference things.
I'm comparing Yesterday's Jeeve's run to today's Jeeve's run
oh
I.... don't do that.
It was more the fact that giga cthuwu was in both
I like to check
Disney+ just advertised the first 30 seasons of the Simpsons.... I feel old....
I like you May bot, you're much nicer than <@UK7V13DS7>
Man the pre-peak scamble gets worse every year
ohhhhh for code changes?
yesterday's job failed, so I ran it manually at 2:30
it is duplicated cuz the job just looks for the last 24 hours
so the duplicates are ones that were created after 11:30 but before 2:30 yesterday
That's what I figured
:sev3::sev2::sev1::sev0:
:wayfair-explosion:
lol
that sev yesterday was a pain
:thisisfine:
Which one there were so many dakota
the one where admin and every api related service went down
ewwwwwww
sev didn't end till 5:00
started at 12:13
Yea that took a while
I love aldi
Good Morning
Sounds like Aysh is still in German
How long are you there for?
I'm on my way back from ze German
But I will always love aldi
Aldi is the best
There is an Aldi in Medford. but of course that's not going to be the same as one in Germany
Dude the Bos Announcements about lunch rooms really blew up
yeah...
you all listening to the impeachment stuff?
I have #nonwork-politics open
No I was doing my job earlier and they've been super quiet lately
Clearly good day for watching
I'm not listening as its occurring. I've been looking at analysis of the released transcripts. I have too much word to follow to hearings directly.
I'll get good summaries tonight as every media outlet processes the day's testimony.
I'm kinda with Doug I don't have that much time to dedicate
it'd be fun. but unfortunately I'm not a professional journalist or pundit.
Anyone wondering if we'll have the first ever impeachment of a president? Or will this go the route of nixon?
this is not the first impeachment.
Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton where both impeached
but neither removed.
What's the difference between a successful impeachment and just the inquiry?
Do we even have words to separate them?
Inquiry if for fact-finding.
Impeachment is the House saying we think we need to get rid of this guy.
Then the Senate holds a trial with the House acting as prosecution. They vote to remove the President from office. At that point they can also vote to bar him from ever being elected again.
If you think of it like a criminal trial:
Inquiry is the cops and DA snooping around for evidence.
Impeachment is when they decide they have enough to go to trial.
yes
all this was written by lawyers. They have so many words.
Yea but I mean the difference between a conviction and a non conviction?
I believe the answer is yes, but I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know all the words.
Got it
Anyway I'm curious if this will go _all the way_ or if we'll have another Nixon cop out
HISTORY!
I recommend _All The Present's Lawyers_, a podcast with a lawyer regarding these issues.
I don't imagine Trump resigning. He is fighter. he'll scrap forever.
That's why i'm excited! he doesn't seem smart enough to get out while the getting is good
quite possibly. but then again, right now his odds of reelection are not bad.
he's polling well in a couple swing states.
Very sad....
Also, the president is not the only position than can be impeached. Several supreme court justices have been impeached, most very early in the country's history.
Sooooo what you're telling me is
we can get rid of Trump's Appointed justices?
you mean senate approved justices.
Senate turns over
There have been 19 impeachments. from wikipedia:

&gt; &gt;&gt;15 were federal judges: thirteen district court judges, one court of appeals judge (who also sat on the Commerce Court), and one Supreme Court Associate Justice.
&gt; two were Presidents: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton; both were later acquitted by the Senate.[34]
&gt; one was a Cabinet secretary
&gt; one was a U.S. Senator.
Whoa
Neato
the impeachment of justices is more for drunkness or gross misuse of power. Disagreeing with them isn't enough.
Can we try impeaching so we can throw them in Jail?
oh, there were also impeachment inquiries into Nixon and Buchanan (just finding out about that one). but neither turned into successful impeachment votes. Nixon because he resigned, Buchanan was just not quite corrupt enough
Impeaching is civil. Other than the president, holding office isn't a shield from jailtime.
also, which justices are you wanting to imprison? I haven't seen anyone suggesting that.

My feet hurt from all the walking
What walking did you do? Some where fun
About seven to ten hours each day ....Prague and Vienna
Nice!
Aren't you having a baby?

Puppies and babies are like Peanut Butter and Jelly
They go better together!
In that case, you should make sure the baby and puppy have the same birthday and only refer to them as the twins
I mean.... I'm not opposed to this
I think Mei might try to murder me though.....
What's a little murder between two people who say they care about each other?
Not a lot she threatens me often
I don't want to judge, but that doesn't seem good. You should also threaten her, that's very healthy
Do you threaten the ant? Of course not! You just squish it when you want to

Good morning! I feel like aysh's mad cackle wouldn't be that scary in person
Don't listen Aysh, I bet your laugh would be very scary
it IS! thank you
so- I was in Berlin amsterdam vienna and Prague. Prague was my favorite and I took time picking out a souvenir magnet from there. others I was meh abotu and just bought the first thing I saw. Berlin, I only bought one after I got to the airport and threw it in my back pack
Bizarrely, all my magnets are gone.

2 from my checked in bag, and 1 from my back pack that I had on me the whole journey.

other than the Prague one.
:tinfoil_hat:
Tin is weakly magnetic. Maybe the magnets are in the hat. 
Victoria, I like you.
you know, the feature toggle page is one page that should REALLY not go down
espeically after telling people to not deploy things on friday
minions!!!
:)
Its amazing that they only just recently cracked down on the "don't deploy on Friday thing". I was told that first thing when I joined WF.
I don't think that's what this is
I think it's just this friday is a no deploy day
hm, all Fridays should be no deploy days.
yeah, I generally agree
though I've typically understood it to be friday afternoons are no deploy
now that my sprint starts on a friday, that's mostly a non-issue though
Friday seems like a weird day to start a sprint. you just get going and then, boom, weekend
we do sprint planning on friday
and do some investigation to ensure we're comfortable committing to the work we're assigned
That makes a lot of sense to me. Wayfair for all its faults really feels like it has Scrum down well on the engineering side.
I just want storefront deploy issues to not hold back my deploys
Decouple from the mono repo. 
*to no one in particular* I'll decouple  your FACE
I wonder what would happen if you could have the Repo's fight each other to the death

I am so happy I no longer work there and might have to professionally interact with those people
LOL
They are sort of describing worker councils. This is a normal thing in German factories and such.
I've just never heard of any in the US.
Cause they're called Unions in the US
Union representation sometimes works like that.
And Union busting is a popular past time
but workers councils are different than unions
in that the councils have by-in on actual corporate decision making, as opposed to being adversarial.
more like board members.
It's still a bad idea
honestly I don't like the idea of running elections for that kind of position. It is just asking for people to "campaign" based on the extremes
Sounds like student elections all over again
and only people in favor of massive change would even bother to vote
I agree with the guy, it dramatically increases the politicalness of the organization
Yea I mean a mandate of the company will be decided by like 400 people
Nobody is gonna run under the banner "yeah wayfair did alright with how they handled it"
I also love the way these people act like we don't already have full time jobs
yeah, you probably don't want elections for single-issue positions.
Clearly their managers need to give them more to do
eh for some people it affects how they view their full time job, and whether or not they would like to continue working it
I'm just saying Dakota, these duly elected people are working full time, how much time are they going to dedicate to this initiative?
the 17 committee is a decent effort
And the reason it's not public is because they're ravenous bloodhounds
Apparently Dakota's deploy is finally going through
now? today? its a friday. and a sev day
they threw a 'no deploy' event on my calendar
yeah wtf
Ohhhh I thought he was trying to deploy something because he was crying about the storefront deploys
today is a no deploy barring fixing a sev1 or sev0
WHY HAVE YOU ABANDONED ME DAKOTA!?!?!?! WHY!?!?!?!!?!?!?!
oh no I was just complaining about the feature toggle page being broken
cuz somebody deployed
On no deploy day?
yeah
I don't want to work today anymore......
Can today just be over?
Just leave
lol
There's too many people around still
SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY POD!!!!
I'll throw a meeting on your calendar for now till 5:30
lol
Loudly complain to people how Doug just scheduled a two hour meeting with you. walk to my desk, then leave.
that way people think you are in a meeting
lol
Say you need some team bonding, and spend the rest of the day in front of the kegs?
ha, Dakota had the same idea as me
or just browse politics
yeah, it's quite amusing today
same with activism
true that
It had been a while since I had been able to screenshot activisom posts
It was a good day as a result
yea but they died down pretty quick
that they did
It's sad, they're not nearly as uppity as they once were
GUYS GUYS!!!
NEW DRAMA!
This time in #help-no-stupid-questions
Apparently the MA only plan doesn't meet MA requirements for a health plan, so you'll have to pay tax penalty for taking it!
Never-mind crisis averted, apparently our health plan is made up of many things none of which on their own is good enoug
that brings back memories
There's no trogdor giphies!!!!
:trogdor:
:drama:
Ok what huh
Aysh it's the weekend do something fun
To which part?
It's my lazy don't do anything weekend. Don't @me
Lol
no. good morning to YOU!
So competitive. 
i was going for 'nice
Good Morning Aysh
My train was an hour late today!
SO MUCH FUN!!!!!
Great way to start a weekend.
Also I love the fact that they said "NOBODY DEPLOY FRIDAY" and suddenly we have a Sev 1 on friday and a sev 0 over the weekend
There's like 2 more weeks for them to fix any problems so that's a good thing!
yeah, but they're fucking with our code freeze schedule
Yup. It’s pretty bad. 
I have 3 deploys that need to go out that other work is dependent on
I have 2 as well
I hate life
I'm still puking. I'm pretty sure I'm puking in between tickets and meetings today
I'm sorry Mei, hopefully it gets better!
awww :disappointed: sorry Mei
ohhhhh they're getting fired up in Activism about the email around special needs
beat me to it
our goal is to make it easier for them to spend money
she has a point regarding the autism one though
though the autism one isn't false at an aggregate level from a customer support standpoint
I mean.... I'm sorry that she's getting upset that _businesses designed to make money_ view problems as challenges to overcome rather than super warm and fuzzy _love the world_
But to me it sounds like she needs to go work for a non-profit because we're here to make money
:i-also-like-to-live-dangerously:
:howdareyou:
:dbghappy:
I don't get DBG
Or I don't get dragon ball G
DragonBallGoku maybe?
Maybe
that was my assumption
...is she being sarcastic with the Dementia comment?
Don't think so
Clearly people who have dementia shouldn't be allowed to shop
well, there is a risk
they might not be in a mental state to shop in a financially responsible manner
there are varying stages. we dont stop them from driving, we dont need to stop them from shopping.
I'm with Aysh on this one.... that treads dangerously close to the "You shouldn't have any rights because we don't think you can make good decisions" territory
I think you're misinterpreting what I'm saying
I'm saying that catering towards dementia diagnosed individuals feels predatory given that they might not be in a state to shop in a financially responsible manner
if they're in a good enough state to shop with the regular person shopping experience, fine
if they're not in a mental state where they're capable of doing that, should we be making it easier?
Basically is a certain amount of friction a good thing from a social responsibility aspect?
But it's an online transaction, unless they call customer service, how would you know if they had dementia? It's not the site's responsibility to ensure all customers should be customers.
that's my point
i also think literally everything we do as a business that adds to our operating costs is predatory in its own way.


Also,

`Memory loss

Difficulty communicating

Difficulty with visual and spatial abilities

Difficulty reasoning or problem-solving

Difficulty handling complex tasks

Difficulty with planning and organizing

Difficulty with coordination and motor functions

Confusion and disorientation`

other than 'confusion' i dont think anything else can be taken  advantage of...and we do have custimer service and offer free returns if something is done in erros.

And if the dementia has progressed enough to warrant that protection,I'd expect they dont have access to online shopping?
This statement confuses me, can you clarify Aysh?

&gt; i also think literally everything we do as a business that adds to our operating costs is predatory in its own way.
Do you mean adds to a profit instead of costs?
The revenue that will come from this will be minuscule enough to not warrant the investment.
I think its a gesture of goodwill
Ahhhhhh
<@UDDE5960N> ok, predatory might be a harsh word but.... everything from all company meetings, to snacks...theyre all done to increase goodwill towards the company so we stay. you know? not because we are being cared for as individuals or anything
#nonwork-activism would hate that idea
I agree though
OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH YOU MEAN TOWARDS US!!!!!!
I thought you meant our customers
My personal philosophy, HR is here to make sure the company doesn't get sued internally just like legal's job is to make sure the company doesn't get sued externally
i mean EVEN towards us ...but customers too

Free returns are to gain more customers- not because i care that someone bought the wrong sized cutrains and shouldnt pay for them
I mean is anything people do ever truly altruistic? Generally people you're friendly with are people who make you happy. You make them happy too but everyone gains in that relationship
Is that considered altruistic?
:yo-1::yo-2::yo-3:
yup
that was the secondary plotline in a freinds episode
lol
Me, everyone should be working towards win-win scenarios that's what makes everyone happy
Summon the Silent
Good Morning
<@UDDE5960N> you see the story about South Dakota’s anti-meth campaign?
Meth, We're on it!
YES! IT'S GREAT!
is responding with 'K' rude?
Depends......
Are we being sarcastic and condensing when we say it? Or are we saying it in such a way that we want the person to go away? Or is it just a normal K and someone is getting uppity?
use kk instead
This way you run the risk of typing kkk in too EXTRA FUN!!!!
I just wanted to type fewer letters.
K is sounds like 'i dont agree but i'm done discussing'
kk has no savings over k. also, doubling things up sounds cutsey, which was also not the intention
its like 'talk to the hand'
kk is like. :salute_cap:
why dont you want to be cute doug!
sometimes. just not this time. discussing facts about board game night is not the time for cute.
I imply nothing by posting this
That person has too much time on their hands
unlike doug, who doesnt have time to type an 'o'
I guess that makes sense, kk has no benefit over ok
other than it's a double tap
:kay:
:kk:
:ok:
HOW DO THEY NOT HAVE DOUBLE TAP!?!?!!?
whats double tap
well yes, against zombies you double tap
Double tap is slang for shooting it twice generally once in the head
is it not what you do on instagram to automatically 'love' a post
Yea.... that's what all the giphy's are about and it's sad AYSH SAD!
kk is dismissive
not respectful
IMO
Is today a bad day?
No way
hm, I'm doing devOps, so it can't be a very good day.
can't figure out how to get my local k8s cluster to read my local docker images.
helm repos probably aren't set up correctly.
Dev ops sounds painful
Is K8 kubernets or something else?
yeah
Got it, NO IDEA what they are
I'm sad your stuff is broken
Text just really desn't translate well
omg, just discovered I'm using a version of a tool that was deployed 6 days ago. explains why all the documentation on the internet seemed to just not work.
LOL!
How did you get such a new version?
well, I just downloaded it 4 days ago...
Yea.... but like isn't this a Wayfair approved tool? It should take them more than 2 days to vet
we're disconnecting from WF tools
^approved, it should still go security analysis or _something_
Or are you guys just dling free open source stuff?
It'll go through all that eventually. but security doesn't approve every cli tool engineers use.
ahhhh
Too late on the discussion, but I've always found "K" to be *Got it, fuck you, we're done here" or at the very least, slightly rude. 
"Kk" is just "Ok!" "Roger that" it is at least neutral to friendly, but the person realizes there is a micro efficiency to typing two of the same letter over two separate letters
Yup i'm with Drew on this one
Text sucks as a medium for conversation, but no one goes into chat rooms to voice chat, because we all know how the internet handled Xbox live
You mean you don't like being told how your mom got gang banged by 10 years olds?
K
KKKKKKKKK
SKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSKSK
ꓘ
^means you struck out looking.
what does that mean
in baseball a strike is marked as a 'K', but if you didn't even swing at the last strike, then you "struck out looking" and that's marked by the backwards K
for some reason, that K was upside down in my mind.
depends which direction you are, I guess. If you're on your side reading this, then it was upside-down
An upside down K is the same as on that is rightside up
Nobody want's to strike out looking
I want to choose what i want :disappointed: dont dictate my life!
remember, you miss 99.7% of all pitches you don't swing at.
I'm concerned about that .3%
Is those that pitches that hit me
!?!?!?1
yes
I looked it up, hit by pitch is like .266%
I was gonna ask, but i knew he did that on purpose, and didn't wanna fall into a trap
thanks for taking the bait cj
I mean.... It's less taking the bait and being more terrified that I get hit that often
I wonder if it's meaningful higher comparing swung at pitches vs all pitches
I stopped playing baseball when the kids started becoming stronger, and accuracy became a big problem
NOOOO NOT JEEVES!!!!!
Also I will be OOO 12/3-12/7
And by OOO I mean on a completely different continent
Oh yeah JEEVES IS DEAD 11/26 TILL 12/4
CJ have you changed desks recently?
Uhhhh I'm in the same Pod since we moved to boylston
and do you mind if I leave the game at <@UETS9HTSS>’s place
Literally switched sides
or would you prefer I bring it back to the office
Nope
Doug got it
oh gothca
that makes more sense
Literally just now
Anyway I trust brenden enough to not need you to bring it back
So the Chaos Monkey Christmas gift giving is back this year. Opting not for a secret santa but instead some kind of Yankee swap or white elephant (which are apparently not the same thing?). 
Would need to know how many people, and any suggested ideas. Some current thoughts that were talked about:
1) everyone submits games that they own. Whether one member or multiple own it, it goes on a banned list for gifts. 
2) game must be a board game over X value. Probably a range between $25-$60
3) No troll gifts 
4) No picking your own gift
5) Game can be something we've played before, just not one that somebody already owns. 
6) post a comment to this thread if you'd like to play.
This would have made sense for the #schemes channel but it's a chaos monkey thing, so to chaos monkey it goes
I wasn’t in chaos last year, so I missed it. 

In this year. 
I would play
Good Morning
Summon the Silent
I'd also like to play
Does that work as a command or you just edited after the fact?
Maybe......
I mean I could make it work as a command
Would be fun
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UETS9HTSS> How did you like dead of winter?
a bit torn
I like the concept
But
It's a fun, lighter night kind of game. I put it on the same tier as Betrayal at _________, Pandemic, or Forbidden Desert
and how you don't have perfect information
I dislike the down-time
I was able to cook for a potluck while playing
and make cocktails
which feels off
I feel like I'd have gotten bored if I didn't have those other things to do
hmmmmmm..... I didn't think it was terrible slower than most games
drew had his nose in the rulebook
because he wanted to betray us
Drew later or lighter? Because I don't think it's a light game
and needed to learn how much he was allowed to fuck us up
I mean that's not suspicious for drew he generally has his nose in the rule book
Which is how I allowed Dakota to take a lot of heat
I meant lighter. Had we known the finer points of the rules better, I don't find the game very complicated
Ehhhh now I want to try.  When we played no one knew the game
I also don't remember the problem that Brenden was talking about with large down time
Drew you could probably figure out how to make it work
think of it as an excersise in python
:you're-my-only-hope:
EPIC
got my project working!!!! I hate devOps sooo much!
YEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Why did you link us the Grimm's Fairy Tales?
No and Yes
Why not?
More so just making sure I wasn't missing the point
The issue is assuming there was a point in the first place
point is that it sounds Grim and i like that and its on sale
I wonder if the word grim comes from the Grimm fairy tales?
They had... _grim endings_
Boom Dad joking it
Old English, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch grim and German grimm .
<https://www.quora.com/Did-the-term-grim-come-from-the-rather-gruesome-Grimm-fairy-tales>
that seemed to answer nothing......
the word came before the brothers
&gt; Grim is a Germanic word, just like German and English are Germanic languages, and the last name Grimm means grim. Possibly after a place named Grim for the brothers Grimm. 
That would argue Brothers Grimm &gt; Place named Grimm &gt; Grim meaning
<@UETS9HTSS> there's a Wii here at Goodwill for $10. Want it?
does it come with wires?
or just the base console?
is it one of the old ones?
I only want it for backwards compatibility
(is the wii logo perpendicular to the disk drive?)
It has wires
Wii logo perpendicular
I'll take it!
you know what
nevermind
I'll find a package deal on craigslist or something
thanks for asking though
means I dont gotta lug it home  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Good morning!
Summon the silent
But...I like the darkest corners of my mind...
I like it there too, Victoria.
I mean isn't that a good thing for you then victoria
I would agree, but the summon said plead in pain, which seems incorrect
Vain, not pain
But I get your point
so I found out this morning that I'm going to have to move all my stuff out of my bedroom and into the living room for 2-3 days at some point soon so all my flooring can get replaced
that's going to suck
good excuse to get rid of stuff though
perhaps I'll sell my desk or something
it'll be nice not having a giant hold in your floor anymore
there's no hole, just warping
or did you actually mean hold? if so, what does that mean?
oh, just warping. I'm remembering wrong
there was once a hole
that was repaired
that's it
You gotta bring a tent and have a little camp out in the living room
Grow a massive beard in the time
Get the crazy eyes going, it'll be a blast!
I saw slack made shared channels easier to manage and got excited for a minute
but you can't use them in the free version of slack
slack
:slack2:
Ohhh they hid the shared channels again
Wait why do you want shared channels WHAT OTHER SLACK DO YOU HAVE?!?!?!
I want to make <#CDBT6UTCL|game-night-schemes> more accessable
so people can access it from the wayfair slack
if they so choose
Pretty sure you'd have to be a slack admin for wayfair to make that happen
Also why not just bring those people here?
I initially read this as your roommates were going to force you to move all your stuff from the living room to your bedroom and thought "Well, that's gonna cause some long term problems"
This seems much better, if cumbersome for a few days.
Because people are lazy and anything that makes it even a little bit easier tends to be a good thing
So would we have to upgrade to paid slack to share that channel with Wayfair?
Because honestly, the cost would come down to a very small amount per person, and I certainly use this enough to justify the payments
yeah, that would be a problem
it would be around $6 to $8 per user of this slack
per month
There is a chance we would have to work with wayfair to get the shared channel. I'm not sure it's a thing that any random user can do
doing so would discourage people from joining this channel though
I'm not sure what the benefit it is
we can link this channel directly to wayfair
I think you only need admin access from one instance
one instance hosts the shared channel
why did jeeves post in two parts? did it go over a character limit?

The final 3 (4? 5?) missions of StarCraft Brood War are fucking brutal
I didn’t get that far in brood war without cheat codes. 
I did I forgot
I remember original SC missions kind of being same-y. SC2 did a great good job making each mission feel like a new thing.
Well, this is mission 8 of the Zerg campaign. So there's 2 more after this, plus a bonus mission, and possibly another bonus hidden in some campaign folder stuff.
Which is the mission where they throw coordinated Zerg + Terran mixed attacks together. It's brutal
:zerg:
I ran into someone in the kitchen at work and caught myself saying 'its been a long day'

I wasn't event 9 AM
NICE!
It's already been a long day and I agree
i think its been a long life and we all need a nap
I agree I did not want to get up today
I was gonna work from home today, but then I realized I would literally get nothing done if I did, wich would be a bad idea the day before I have a week off
LOL!
and so here I am, already having missed a meeting and playing with :ralph_danger:
or, it means that you wouldn't face the consequences for slacking off for a whole week?
any consequence more than 1 day away doesn't count.
LOL!
:lol:
How is :ralph_danger: doing?
I'm really just reading up on NoSql, which will be used in Ralph, but will also help out with Aerospike at wayfair
My team is switching to MongoDB and loving it
Ohhhhhh...... I have 0 experience with NoSQL
same
Trying to map out what I want Ralph to be storing, the structure of how it should be stored, and how to do it all without exceeding the free-tier limit
WTF is Ralph's point other than the fact you can do it on AWS?
Yes
Theoretically it can act as a more stable Prometheus
Well how can you map out what you want if you don't know what it is?
and it will have a DB backend
Well, it will still need to respond to slack events
so I need to decide if I want to store the events
Ahhhh got it
Theoretically i could get prometheus up in it's current state on AWS in an hour or so
More than happy to chip into Race for the Galaxy to ward off the boredom for CJ and Brenden
you said you're moving to AWS Lambda too right? My team is doing serverless functions with Apache OpenWhisk
Yeah, AWS Lamda
:several_people_are_typing:
I'm bored this morning?
I am also confused by drew's statemetn
I had to verify twice that it wasn't :dejavu:
Agreed
I know you hadn't responded, I just knew CJ didn't want to get up, and it is Friday
Fuck it, playing StarCraft instead
LOL! Yea my Friday is marked by being double booked today
i got the pre-read for doing sql unit tests using docker on a linux vm
Bored is not a problem
so I'm looking to set that up
Sounds fancy I wish I could say fancy words like that
Same, but I use my free time poorly instead of learning to code
Wow go write a prometheus function
LOL!
<@UDBV9N1E0> you even still alive and actively reading this slack?
Write a functionality that reacts with :lol: every time somebody uses lol
I could share my :dnd: code with you, I kinda gave up on that
Mostly because I got annoyed with all the exception handling I would have tod

I mean, he was taking 2 hour lunches and drinking two beers and two large whiskey glasses
sounds excessive to me
11/16 days too
damn
My favorite

&gt; On June 14, MBTA officials, including D’Angelo’s immediate superior, General Manager Steven Poftak, were dealing with a crisis. They were scrambling to restore service and the faith of T riders, days after a particularly damaging train derailment on the Red Line.
&gt; 
&gt; "I want to assure everyone that the MBTA is working 24 hours a day to address this incident," Poftak told reporters.
&gt; 
&gt; But for D’Angelo, it was bottoms up again that day. He kicked back and drank for three-and-a-half hours with stops at two bars, The Point and the 21st Amendment, drinking two large whiskeys and a couple of beers.
There's having a beer with lunch and a drinking problem, he seems to be more on the side of having a problem
It pays to be well connected
Not anymore apparently
I'd be more ok wit this if his department was doing well. being hands-off when things are good can be a good thing.
bad to be hands-off when everything is falling apart
I mean.... Clearly he's going to land on his feet doing something else equally shitty
You can't tell me he magically became shitty now
:magic-wand:
Yeah, this is more infuriating because he oversees a part of the MBTA which is very clearly not doing so hot. Plus after 4 drinks, you are not in the best state of mind, regardless of your "tolerance"

that is pretty accurate to SC
play WC3, then its actually the dead.
I will always be sad that WoW came out
WC franchise was soooo neat
I do prefer SC to WC, so I'm not too sad.
I mean for a Universe that started out as orcs vs. humans, WC3 was a neat way to give it depth that allowed it to tie the universe togther
WoW took away my freshman year of high school. While I think WC had a really immersive story that got tangled by creating a MMO, it did radically change the scape of gaming for over a decade. Shit was addictive.
The SC universe always had an amazing story
I've never really MMO'd
Day 1 of PTO, pinged in criticals channel at 9:00AM

Sister team deployed some code last week that broke my code
ewwwwww
I pointed out it's their fault and im back to not paying attention :2thumbsup:

I was gonna say, you break it you fix it
Things like this are worth writing down for future reviews. "You can pay me more, or watch me NEVER respond to moments of crisis like this again."

People are so dumb!!!!
The WOC sent out an email for people getting cyber5 updates
And dumb people are sending emails to the thread
asking to be added, and now people are responding to the 1 off emails telling them not to spam the group
And there's the bonus dumb lady who sent an email saying "test" in the subject line and that's it
Nevermind someone just sent an email with nothing in it, that's the new dumb person email of the day
Doubt you can top that
and that's why I don't read my email
lol
AYSH YOU'RE SUCH A TROLL!!!!!!!!!!
i am not QUEEN DODO HEAD!
I was soooo annoyed at you till I realized you only sent it to me and doug
lol
aww
I was hoping you trolled more people
why am I not getting all these emails?
i considered adding you briefly but thought you were offline
my bad
nah, not just you
in general
Are you on `<mailto:PromoHourlyUpdates@wayfair.com|PromoHourlyUpdates@wayfair.com>`
too late
:thinking_fb:
Might want to reach out to the WOC to know why you're not being annoyed too
I can forward them to you so you can feel the pain too
should I just send it to `<mailto:PromoHourlyUpdates@wayfair.com|PromoHourlyUpdates@wayfair.com>`?

I'm going to forward all the rest of the emails to you

Is anyone <!here> going to be in Boston for Thanksgiving? I'm panicking right now pretty hard bc my dog walker for Tess dropped out last minute and I'm messaging everyone I know to see if anyone is around? I just need someone to take care of her for Thanksgiving day and Friday, so Thurs afternoon - Fri afternoon. Can pay and all that
No I get that, I also see it
I'm in NY; so not me
I already reached out to Mei to see if she has a problem
I wouldn't be able to get up to your place on Thursday given the fact I'm going the wrong that day
That seems like poking a bear

God damn Nic cage drowning people in pools as part of his movies

Ah, so that sounds like it wouldn't work out for you CJ? Thanks anyway :slightly_smiling_face:
:seizure:
I haven't gotten a response from Mei yet
I'm sitting in an empty google meet
I dislike this article. It suggests formality corresponds to disdain. I've generally found the inverse to be true. Formality in writing suggests care. Its pretty rare to write formally about something you give zero shits about when you have the option to write informally.
I was supposed to present a dashboard I threw together for cyber 5 during another team's standup
Not so much disdain but I would go more with sarcasm
I disagree, I think it argues that formality only suggests something akin to disdain when it is complemented by brevity
As much as I do love formality in writing, I can't disagree that extremely brief, formal communications can be interpreted poorly.

blueberries and dolphins...
Confirmed I was sent the wrong link
Now I have to present it tomorrow
Ummmmmm WHAT!??!!?
:facepalm:
there is a blueberries and dolphins for everything
I feel like this is a degrees of freedom exercise
is it really dusty today? the air has looked weird today.
It was foggy this morning in Attleboro, but not really dusty
It's my day off anyway. Also I'm on slack most of the time when I'm NOT at work since you all work during the day and I work nights.
What does this actually entail? I'll be gone Thursday afternoon from 11:30-5:30, but otherwise I'm around that night and Friday day. Sam and I had plans and what not, so it just depends on how much attention Tess needs in that 24 hour span.
As little or as much as you'd want. She just needs to go out Thurs afternoon, Thurs evening, Fri Morning, then Fri afternoon. She always loves attention, but would be fine with the bare minimum for 24 hrs
Hmm, let me talk to Sam about it. I could actually swing the Thursday "afternoon" (would be like 10:30), Thursday evening, and Friday morning, just based on where I'm going to be or have the rental car already. Friday afternoon would be tough because I have work I need to be there by 4:45 for.
I *might* actually have someone who is much closer to my apartment. Thanks a bunch though! I'll let you know if it works out or not
Ok, let us know! I'll keep working Mei over to see if she'll let me borrow Tess
Ok, talked to Sam and she would be fine with it for the 3 shifts I said were pretty easy for us. So if this person can only help out Friday afternoon, you've got the coverage you need.
Thanks CJ and Drew! How would it work though for you, Drew? You don't have a car, right? That's a really long trip from my place to yours, I don't think I could, in good conscious, ask you to do that 4 times
We needed a car Thanksgiving day so we got a Zipcar. Currently paying an hourly rate, but we'd just get it for the whole day if we were covering the Thursday shifts. Difference in rate is like $25. 
As Friday, we're already going up to Assembly sq for black Friday morning, so we'd just detour from there. Honestly if you want to just pay the rental fees for a Zipcar for Friday for a couple hours, we'd probably be able to do the afternoon shift too.
If CJ can take her, it does have the advantage of she'd get more attention since she'd be at someone's house.
tf is that REDACTED thing?
A bot. There's a banned word every day.
That's a mad long drive for CJ too. Drew, how far is it out of your way? Would you be making the trips just for this? I don't want to be too inconvenient. My manager just let me know that he might be able to make it, but it'd be tough for him
So, what'd I miss? I see that Doug is now an active participant, Aysh likes coffee, people talk about how tired they are every morning, and there are a lot of bots that do things
There's a bi-weekly tuesday game night these days
I'm directly south of where you live, so Google tells me it is a 20 minute drive right now.
I s (banned word)
is is banned?
yes
Drew, would you want to take her to your apartment? I mean, you could also stay overnight at my place if you'd like? That'd cut down the commute a lot haha
Sorry, I just feel like a jerk asking people to do this...
Oh I'm totally of the opinion the only way this works is if Tess comes down to Attleboro, a drive to get her and drop her off isn't a big deal. Trying to do that multiple times a day would be though.
and I get this sucks, and you had plans and someone backed out. So don't feel bad asking
Which if you wanted to participate we could probably shift to a different night (smash bros and all)
For the record the bots are also slightly opt in now
Yea, Tuesday is the only day I have something haha
However Doug is not opted in for any bots
For what is worth, Wednesday night has been free every single week since I started. I guess they just don't have anyone else for day coverage then.
You helped me move at the asscrack of dawn. I don't mind the drive. Besides, half the trips for me are attached to driving I'd already be doing.
My apartment isn't dog friendly and Tess isn't exactly a quiet dog. Nice dog, but quiet isn't her thing.
Which sucks because there is a dog park LITERALLY RIGHT OUT FRONT!
Also if wife/fiancee signs off on something, it's ok.
Also is anyone else in for the White elephant Yankee swap?
Alright, thanks so much everyone, I really, _really_ appreciate it so much. My manager lives &lt;10 min away and turns out it wouldn't be a big deal for him to watch her, so I'll go with him to watch her. Again, thanks a bunch and I might very well ask again in a panic next year :upside_down_blob: (or maybe Christmas :grimace_blob:). :hug:
Please express my thanks to Mei and Sam!
(unless Mei says no. In which case, tell her thanks anyway)
Ok, as long as you're all set!
I did convince Mei it would be fine, so I'll tell her you said thanks
:thanksfam:

So who here has seen Joker?
Silence Chaos Seed
Not yet. 
I have! What would you like to know?
Was the music very loud in your screening?
No, not noticably
Ok, weird showing then. I'm curious as to why <@UDDE5960N>  liked it so much.
What did you think of it <@UPGVCMGD9>
I'm with marissa it wasn't overly loud
Like is a strong word. It's a movie everyone should see and does a good job of making a believable chaotic evil character
I would say I liked it. Definitely a gripping film that shows how he became who he was. I appreciated the slow development of his character
I recognize it was well done. I just don't think I liked it in the end.
That's fine. It's not a film for everyone, although I think lots of people should see it because it makes you uncomfortable
Good Morning!
Summon the Silent!
Summon the Silent
Good Morning and happy Turkey Day Eve!
Happy Turkey Day Eve to you too Victoria
QUAAACK
Do you want to buy a duck?
what sound does a turkey make
Gobble gobble
thats what you make when you eat it
I can't tell if Aysh is trolling or being serious.....
Dead serious.
I didnt have pets growing up
In english, turkey's make a "Gobble Gobble" sound when they speak. While gobbling is an action we take eating turkey that would not be the noise associated with it.  Probably more grunting noises
oh- so you had a pet turkey?
my neighbor had pet Peacocks
I feel like I'm being trolled...... No pet turkey's dogs.  Turkey's I've had to deal with were either wild pain in the asses, or in Zoos
And I don't know how to feel about the fact that your neighbor had pet peacocks.....
He was the #1 cardio thoracic surgeon in Asia
He deserves his peacocks
LOL IT PULLED THAT BACK UP! <@UDC4QL95G> <@UDC03KCGK>
Its clear that isnt me because I never speak fairlt
LOL!
Anyway, yes I have seen turkey's in person  and the sound the make sounds like gobble gobble, the same way a cat makes a meow sound.  But different languages express animal noises separately.
WOW I JUST REMEMBERED
That we had that convo before?
My school in India, out of nowhere, bought a couple of turkeys that would roam the 'garden's
I was in the school choir, and when we would practice, those things would come close to the auditorium green room where we practiced and 'sing' with us
so...
WE HAD PET TURKEYS
i started this trolling but now im not i swear
uh huh
2x streak me posting in here :doot:
Aysh is the real chaos here. Only <@UETS9HTSS> can hope to match chaotic prowess with her.
By the way, did people here see Disenchantment?
I have to say I've always enjoyed the stuff that Matt Groening puts out
I don't know. The discussion I'm hearing is that it is a very affecting movie, which it is, and that it paints a stark picture of mental health. However, I find it to be a film that is trying to make a tragic figure out of a character you shouldn't be rooting for, but you are because the Joker is a character that had a kind of fun villain sheen to him. 
Like this movie would be better to me divorced of all things related to Batman. It just wouldn't get as widely seen.
As someone who has had mental health struggles, certainly not to the variety by any stretch depicted here, it felt like it was undermining that message. That everyone is toxic to people with mental health problems. That's just not the case today. It's still out there, no doubt, just not as laid on thick as depicted here.
Unfortunately I hadn't even heard of it
I'm getting thro it, got almost to the end of S2
It's always been... good, but not great. Like, most of the jokes fail to land, but they're still enjoyable enough to experience
BUT
The latter half of season 2 has really turned it up. I don't know what they did, but the characters are more compelling, the writing is much better, and I'm actually laughing at the jokes now rather than just smirking
See I kinda disagree.  I think it's great in the Batman universe! Thomas Wayne being shown as a real person with real flaws.  And I mean the Joker in the golden age is personified chaotic evil.  The random killings are on point.  He's a character that's almost impossible to give a back story to because of his chaotic and evil nature.  This shows how someone like that can come into being, not by force of power, but by a disaffected populace.
is that the show about a fantasy kingdom that looks like futurama?
As to the mental health, this is placed in the like the 60s so it's on point there. And I would argue that it's not a stretch to see that kind of abuse today.
yea
I think it's set in the 70's, but there's several elements to the film that place it in all sorts of times
I think the first season does a good job of setting up the characters/universe.  But the second season is where they come into their own
okta thinks my hometown in NY is in Utah
Also one of my buddies was mentioning the fact that there's all sorts of hidden things.  Like a treasure hoard having a holophoner.  So I think this is a show that needs more than one watch to reach it's full potential.
weirdly, its only one season. I'm not sure why netflix is doing this whole two half seasons thing. Although I guess Rick and Morty is doing it now too.
Yea, definitely. Season 1 just wasn't there humor-wise either tho, felt like a cheap knock off of Futurama for me. Like, I see what they were going for, but their timing/presentation was just a beat or 2 off. Except the court jester and his "oh no". That was hilarious every time
WINNING!
I think it's based in Utah or smth, cause I get that every time now
I did not realize that Doug.  I like it better as a full 20 episodes rather than 10 and 10
I agree with Dave that the two halves feel different. They should just call it season 1 and 2.
Didn't they? I had thought that it was, but I never really looked at the official demarcation.
nope. officially its a single season of 20 episodes. pretty dumb.
oooh, it's "Part 1" and "Part 2" rather than seasons. That's... weird
yea i agree and did not realize
Especially because both part 1 and part 2 ended on cliff hangers
I mean I at least get mass when I log in
I get Utah when I log into VPN, but Mass when I log to okta
huh interesting
SPOILERS!!!!!1111!!!
Also, I'm not sold on Bean's voice actor. She has a good voice for the part, but she has like, no comedic timing
Eric Andre and John DiMaggio both do some really solid work
very very true, they've always been great
And I think Elfo is good most of the time and has gotten a lot better in season 2 since his writing vastly improved
:there_can_be_only_one:
We should all get the entire week of thanksgiving and the week of Christmas off
No last minute prep for Peak? Also I feel like a company like wayfair can't institute that because you have a skeleton crew working and that's unfair to them
Eh, my team doesn't do anything for Cyber5 so :sounds_like_a_you_problem:
:smile:
Nah, my world is ops, we finished up all the stuff we care about weeks ago.  Now it's just time to wait and see if it matters
BATTLE MODE ON
See? So you can take the week off too!
I don't disagree Dave, but I also work a lot with people on the pointy end of the stick
I mean you want to give them and extra 2 weeks I'd be fine with that
more PTO isn't a bad thing
seems good to me
It's so quiet
SOOOO QUIET!!!!!!!!!!
I'm not sure which approach I'm going to take to do the thing I'm gonna do and I really don't want to have to think about it the day before thanksgiving
My team switch has let us be crazy productive compared to how things used to be. Used to be I basically didn't get anything done before noon. Now I got like 4 things about before lunch.
Except my brain now things the day is dragging. "I did like 6 things today and its only 2:30"
lol
See isn't slack a great way to waste time and not think
Doug you're just talking about the Mongo switch or something else?
its a whole thing. moved to Java+Mongo and several SDKs. so entirely off WF deploy process (that's a big one for speeding us up)
WTF is SDK?
Software development kit
Soooo your speed to deploy has drastically increased?
lightweight wrappers in various languages that point to our core code.
and code review as well.
Nice
Now you're just limited by yourselves rather than all of Wayfair
Sooooooo...... basically like calling functions?
This seems like... a pointless abstraction
lets the python team write python and the java team write java
its a pretty common pattern
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
So the Wrapper is in Python, but the actual code is in something like C++?
yeah, so I can write in whatever i want and let any team plug it into their code.
Well I did it. I finally beat Brood War. 
On to another game before I get sucked into the months it will take me to work my way through StarCraft 2
Happy Turkey Day Monkeys! May your bellies be full and the games be plentiful!
Feel free to eat things better than turkey. 
Agreed :) Guess who is hosting Thanksgiving with less than 24 hours notice: Me! But it's okay because I was already planning on making all the yummy sides anyways
Hmmmmmm that sounds like a story
My parents originally said we were going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving without asking me what I wanted to do. I still wanted to make all the sides I like, so I was doing that this morning. They called me at 11am to ask if I wanted to
Go to the restaurant. My mom was feeling tired and they decided to come over. I would do everything the same, except more. And I would have bought duck breast.
Well alls well that ends well
Yeah it means we can play more games as well
And we all know that's the important part!
Happy Thanksgiving!
View from my room!!!
Where are you?
Nice!
Where am I?
In my room
I'm in Ibiza for the night.
And I'm in my room because my feet hurt
Ibiza sounds amazing :heart_eyes:
Too much partying from yesterday?
Zero partying. Only walking up and down cobblestone streets
Ohhhh so much fun :)
Got lost in that fortress thing for a good two hours
That is a lovely way to spend a day
I completely agree! :upside_down_face:
That looks really cool. 
Who or what group did you go with(I assume the person taking the photo)?
I went alone! I asked strangers for pictures and they delivered
Seeeee
Those strangers took some good photos. 
Right???!!!
Yeah, you're hitting the lottery with stranger photos
Yeah whenever I ask it looks like a 5 year took my camera
I just don’t get pictures taken of me. 
Pics or it didn't happen
:troll_dance:
I have plenty of those, I just choose to ignore their existence
Good Morning Monkies and Happy holidays!

Yes Sea Wench would be a correct title
Good Morning all!
Orange line is borked
I was sitting there
There were no trains on the monitors
Hmmmmmm
So I did the unspeakable
I went to the green line
It was horrible
that's awkward because you already rode the bus
LOL!
It was so...
Green
And smol
Smol?
Some of us really only know the pain of the green line
:he-smol:
Some ppl keep telling me green is better than orange. They are :wrong:
Green is better than orange if you're still underground, and don't mind being crowded. And it normally doesn't smell like urine
what train smells like urine?
Orange line, in my experience at least
&gt; ~Orange~ Every line, in my experience at least
I'd say not always, but certainly sometimes.
TIL I don't know what urine smells like, or I don't ride the trains very often
Go to downtown crossing and walk between the orange and green lines
Then you'll know
did dakota die?
I feel like I haven't seen him post in a long while
he hasn't posted in <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> since Nov 25th
oh
his slack status on Wayfair slack is "vacationing"
that makes more sense
Did anyone get any games for Black Friday? I didn't bc I have all the games I want for now :upside_down_blob:
He went home for Thanksgiving, surprised hes not back yet though
And no dave because Mei frowns upon game buying since we stopped playing as much. WOOOO IS ME!!!
Gotta bring back :tragedy_looper: so you'll play games more often and get an excuse to buy more
Indeed. I'll let you all know when I have a Saturday free. I do have Sundays off consistently
I mean, I'm free this and next weekend...
I miss watching you guys sweat in terror
Oh, also, I have to play Slap City with y'alls sometime
Do I get to slap <@UDC4QL95G>? He owes me one
Yes
Many times
anyone want to pre-game the holiday party with me and grab an uber over together?
Good Morning!
Summon The Silent
It's like 5pm here. Nice to see you're back
:woah:
No, it's too far for me
Did you died?
I flew home for thanksgiving and pretty much avoided looking at slack to avoid being dragged into work things
I'm not work
I don't care about what architecture or who built what and when it was completed. I don't care to see another churros or tapas. I'm done with this country🥺
Also there is a spot outside my hotel room where I have felt dizzy. Twice.
:aliens_guy:
I think i has some electromagnetic radiation since it's across from the Bermuda triangle.
(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)
Is no one gonna call me out on the bull? Fine!
What country?
Churro and tapas are pretty good
Spain in general
Also, :wave: hi, nice to meet you, I'm Dave
I just wrote it off as you being dizzy again. :P
Hola Dave
I am now 75% bread.
Though I'm pretty sure I've seen you before, one time when I stopped by a games club lunch thing
But now ~I get in too late~ am far too busy doing very important work things to go to games club lunch
<https://media.tenor.com/images/2b2dac6e295e82c91c82ef6b6eeb5c88/tenor.gif|https://media.tenor.com/images/2b2dac6e295e82c91c82ef6b6eeb5c88/tenor.gif>
.... You get in after lunch?
There is a guy on my team that does that. goes home veeeery late
I don't know what you could possibly be referring to because I obviously don't go to games club because I'm far too busy doing important work things. But hypothetically, I get in at like, 10 am, so I have to stay till 6 anyway and don't want to make that later
Why are you mostly bread now? From looking at history of this channel, it seems that you are usually 75% coffee
I went in for coffee and because of credit card minimum, I got churros which is also bread
Because everything here is bread
Other than paella
But all bread
I just want a vegetable stir fry

That's all
But what about all the delicious things? I've heard there are delicious things
And churros are delicious
:envy:
This garlic oil shrimp thing was legit amazing though
yeah, I've heard good things about spanish seafood
But also, you eat it with bread
Churros can get an incurable disease and die!
wow. hot take
I've concluded that any european food that was ever considered good was because they hadn't had Asian food yet.
I concur with you here
go to Paris
....spices, Doug.
spicy is one kind of flavor. herbs are also good though.
everything in Paris was just delicious.
Both are good but different from each other
From my point of view, European food has much more variety. I love Asian food though too
Spices aren't spicy though
spicy is just one of the kinds of good.
Yes but outside of spices and herbs it's...salt, smoke and fat.
I think Asian has more layers that we are aware. Tbh I can count six completely different kinda of cuisines in just south India that I grew up with that I've never seen in Boston (I'm not including it in Asian food, just using it as an example of how we probably don't know)
Oh, I'm not saying that it doesn't. Every meal I had in Japan was different and absolutely amazing. I want to go back JUST for the food.

But, there wasn't that much *variety* in it - a lot of things were very similar. Same thing whenever I've had actual Chinese food (not american chinese) or Indian food. It's almost always great (if made correctly), but a lot of Chinese dishes are very similar in terms of base ingredients and prep style
Though Indian spicy is by far the best spicy. I dislike Mexican spicy and Spanish spicy. Chinese spicy is _okay_ sometimes. Thai spicy is also good
Hey <@UDL020K8D>, you don't do anything with returns through the customer service order wizard, do you?
I’m not with the wizards team anymore. 
:oh: :ohokay:
Cause I'm dealing with trying to zero out the inbound shipping for certain orders automatically on the returns wizard. I tried this a while back, but couldn't get it done in time and settled for a banner instead
There is a returns team. 
yea.... we've worked with them in the past and they didn't really know how it worked. And apparently the responsibility for this tool has changed since then anyway...
Not sure there slack. Maybe just reach out to #order-wizards
Yea, thanks, just a shot in the dark if you knew about it cause I know you do some post-order stuff
I don't disagree, but I love Mexican cuisine. Enjoy what you enjoy, but it's the one thing I love to cook.
Why is the ok symbol blue? I feel like there's more to this emoji than I really get.
Do I recall correctly that you are Vegetarian Aysh? Spanish food without meat is unfortunately like visiting the circus but never stepping foot in the main tent.
I don't know actually
Oh, I like Mexican food well enough, but not a fan of their spicy food
They should really make a really expensive workout bike with a fancy screen for dogs and cats. They could name it "Petloton"
Tread mill will work better though!
Why are you milling pets? Not going to make good bread.
:gross_blob:
Workout bikes work fine
What will you do for the front paws?!??!!
upsidedown
And bikes are more about endurance than leg day
Front paws need endurance too!
Cardio
It's ironic that the word "Cardio" has the word "car" in it, seeing as transit by car doesn't give you much of a cardio workout
cardio - greek
car - Celtic (I had to look this one up, the Romans imported the word from the Celtic French, then the Roman turned to middle french, which was imported to England, where they still had people speaking Celtic, so using the original word. weird circular import)
yes, but it led me to finding a cool circular etymology.
:fair:
:lol:
Oooh, the song of my people
:if-i-were-a-rich-man:
"When he was a young warthog!"
It's a different kind of spice.  I love Thai and Sezchuan spicy as much as Mexican spicy, but they are very different flavors.
See, I really like Thai and Sezchuan bc I feel like they add to the flavor, but Mexican just seems to be heat for no reason :smile:
Well, that can be the case for sure. You're not eating the right Mexican food then, because really well done spices add flavor as well as heat. Similar to how Cajun food is prepared
It is a channel entirely made up of people who are actually participating to coordinate
Unlike when Dakota kicked me out of games-club-lunch immediately after I got slack at Wayfair
Did Nathan Lane ever do Teyva? That seems like it’d be weird. 
good times
Tevye?
The reason I said that is because of :if-i-were-a-rich-man:
And that's from Fiddler on the Roof. Tevye is the name of the main character
So I was trying to figure out the lion king connection to Fiddler. 
I mean, I *have* been to Mexico 3 times :smile:
Sing "If I were a rich man" but to the the same opening as "When I was a young warthog" (or he)
It's just how my brain connected the words to a rhythm, having never known this was a fiddler reference
I see u
Oh good because the joke had clearly died a horrible death
Like the Savannah after every meal

It's a continuation of that song that you started

Huh Thanks <@UETS9HTSS> TIL Apatheist was a thing

I googled "apathy but as a religion"

Ah ok then. I usually enjoy patatas bravas or andouille when I go for tapas
reminded me, in 5th grade I was in a school dance to this song.
Once my principal heard it, she said its either gonna be cancelled on we need to set it to another song.



That, is how I ended up dancing to the theme music of Super Mario Brothers
In the school I was teaching at in Indiana, they had some event (school concert?) where the school choir group sang. So for one of the songs the history teach (who lead the choir) came out and started talking about how the next song was firmly rooted in the 70s and described heroin usage and all that. Then the group sang _White Rabbit._ It was a really weird moment. 8th graders instead of 5th, but still.
or maybe it was a single singer over the other students playing guitar. something like that.
in front of all the parents.

wait you taught at a school?
I was accidentally a math teacher for a year and a half
:smile: :smile: :smile:
'accidentally
can anyone become a teacher without going through like- a diploma in teaching?
the school got an emergency wavier for me since I didn't have a teaching license in the state (or any state). If I wanted to teach longer (which I did not) I'd have to go to some classes and such to get a license.
I think I'm pretty good on pedagogy, my problem was classroom control. 8th graders are the worst people
Its terrible and demeaning and infuriating and i HATE it
I don't get it. Does that mean that I've posted it before? Or is it just random?
you SHOULDNT get it
ok
it's a random response from the channel history
:disappointed:
Ah, one of the OGs
BEFORE all of y'all
:hipster:
wait, what?
the :dejavu: emoji just means that you triggered the bot response spoofed as Rick
the :lol: response is a random response from the channel history
triggering :dejavu: is just chance
Yea, :dejavu: was one of the OG bot ideas. I didn't know that it still existed like that tho
It didn't work the same way back then tho
that's sort of my fault
I caused too much chaos with the original implementation
so they refactored a bit
:slack_explosion:

Yup, the original bot is still around and runs Chaos seed, but most functionality these days is in python with a new bot

If I had ever though t about sunglasses before, then yes, it'd be an aha.
but youve spent time thinking of the fedex logo??
I use fedex, I don't use sunglasses.
:smh:
How do you not use sunglasses?!?!?!
its rather easy.
I'd argue using sunglasses is harder than not.
He doesn't have eyes
I already have glasses.
Don't need sunglasses if you don't have eyes :rollsafe:
are the photo sensitive glasses?
just don't stare at the sun
nope
youll never be president
Ohhhh right you don't drive
I only use sunglasses if
1. I have not yet lost my sunglasses
2. I am currently wearing contacts
3. I remember to grab them
damn, Aysh beat me to it.
<@UDDE5960N> I drove before I came to Boston, never needed them.
:f-this:
:several_people_are_typing:
I don't know how you do it. Sunglasses make being outside easier
...............you edited :this:  to :this: ?
'live in a city that almost never gets sun'
nah, i edited :f-this: to :this:
when you're outside just don't look at the ball of light.
or weare a baseball cap
do you sunscreen, Doug?
no
:smh:
I just don’t go to the beach. 
I only use sunscreen when I plan to swim outdoors
How am I the vampire when I’m * not * protecting myself against the sun?
It's reverse psychology
youre protecting yourself by not goign out in the sun
He never said he avoided going out in the sun
yeah, but do you not KNOW Doug? :stuck_out_tongue:
Do YOU?
not really, actually :stuck_out_tongue:
but i appreciate the call out
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPum07dH_mw>
I go outside, just as mentioned, do not particularly enjoy beaches.
that said, I will wear sunscreen if going canoeing. its just been a while since I've done that.
I'm not referring to burning to ash but more that whenever I see the sun I do that because it blinds me!
baseball cap.
Some days you just have to look straight into the light
yes...go towards it
and that was the last we ever saw of CJ
:rip:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhZTNgAs4Fc>
Good Morning!
Summon the Silent
Councillors feels like it is spelled wrong, but work check hasn't stopped me
Also I don't care if the outlive us all. They don't come across quite so threatening
Holidays get so busy, and when I realize this is always too late to properly prepare
Ummmmm?? What????/
Ehhhhhh they should they're scary controllers of the world
Think like Shadow Government
what preparation do you need to do?
buy gifts
for everyone
I feel like that's not preparation though
Hm, it’s occurring to me I might not have bought gifts for my family for like three years now. 
I’ve mostly been ignoring the holidays. 
I like the fact that it's might, not have not
I got them somethings while in Boston, I just don’t recall the year. Maybe it’s more recent than I think. 
I agree May. 
well I'm gad it works out
I don’t know if it’s because I’m not a kid, or because I’m not religious anymore, or because my family split, but Christmas just doesn’t mean all that much to me anymore. 
its because you grew up?
we dont get the whole week off
we have to BUY things for others
i mean- whats the fun part again?
Yeah, when in school we got like two weeks off.
Getting gifts for others is the fun part!
hi CJ- I am 'others'
:smile:
Ohhh we're exchanging gifts this year Aysh
So the true meaning of Christmas is buying things for Aysh specifically. 
Wait.... we have the Yankee swap
ah- im not game savvy so I passed
So you could do that if you wanted
Fair, we did make it heavily themed. 
I mean.... if that's why you're not participating I'm sorry
I think everyone's universal startegy was go on onto BBG and pick out something in a reasonable price range
dont change the topic CJ :@
What do you mean that's not a topic change
To me that's what makes xmas fun, the gift swapping
Doug just found the true meaning of Christmas :stuck_out_tongue:
whats the best present youve received?
Mei bought me cups for the house, I was stupid happy for them
:smile:
Best gift was probably a game boy color. I was in...... 6th grade? Had Pokémon red and Link’s Awakening. 
Best gift was Super Smash Brothers Melee when I was 9. I was a big fan of Smash64, and my parents KNEW I wanted melee so bad. For one of the first days of Hanukkah, they got me a Gamecube by disguising the controllers in a Macy's box (though I knew something was up bc it didn't close properly). I got Waverace Blue Storm and Luigi's Mansion for it (not really sure why they got me waverace, but :shrug2:)

But night after night, no melee. I was disappointed of course, but I mean, I had already gotten a Gamecube and I'm sure a bunch of other gifts. So it came to the last night. I opened my gift and it was... not melee. I dutifully said "Thanks" to my parents and was still happy to get the gifts, but sad bc I didn't know when I'd be able to get melee. Like, this is the game that I had been wanting for years. I talked about it with my friends at sleepovers (before it came out), I poured over every Nintendo Power article about it, I think I even had a poster (from Nintendo Power) of it in my room.

Then, after we were done with gifts and I was about to leave, my Dad asked me to give him a back scratch. Which I thought was weird, but I said "Okay, I guess one last Hanukkah gift". So I was about to scratch his back and I felt a box below his shirt. I pulled it out and it was Melee!!!!! I was so excited, I probably squealed, and I ran into the back room and put it in right away. It turned out to be completely worth the hype, and the character I *knew* I wanted to play from before release became my main, and still is 18 years later :end:
Most of it is gift buying. Part of it is also getting the apartment ready for the party, car rental for visiting family Sunday, my parents just came out to visit so I've been planning all sorts of stuff with them and just now getting some free time back. 
Plus shipping everything, keeping the damn tree watered, and cooking stuff for different events. 
<@UDDE5960N> because he had the same question
You didn't have cups?
Actually, my gift (provided it is in range) was instantly thought of just by looking at the list.
And yeah, sorry about the heavy theme. We just all know each other through games, did games last year, and didn't really see a reason to deviate from that. 
Like, not everyone is a big drinker, so we wouldn't go boozy. Could just go no theme at all next time, but didn't know there was an appetite for that.
no worries, i dont  mind at all :slightly_smiling_face: gift giving gives me anxiety anyway
Alright <@UDC4QL95G> and <@UDDE5960N>, does this turn into another 150 post thread?
My only thoughts are getting big gifts like game systems were always the highlight of a Christmas.
And that Wave Race was either bundled, or just heavily pushed as a launch title with the Game cube
Random tangent: is there any way to play Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon without a 3ds
They just released the 3rd one, but I'm not buying a 3ds just for that
I would be kinda surprised if there wasn't a 3ds emulator floating around yet
They don't have a marketplace for old games on switch?
As somebody who refuses to buy common household items unless I find them on wayfair clearance, I can understand the joy in finally getting a nice batch of cups
Strangely principled for someone who also doesn't flinch at the cost of ordering in as much as you do.
not sure. Switch has everything so i wouldn't be surprised either ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'll have to dig. I'm just not someone who ever plays random entries in series. Just always have gone chronological
I am cheap about pretty much everything, except food. And even then, I wont order in unless I find a deal or free delivery
Main reason for not cooking is i never learned and I just really cant be bothered to do so.
this is such a wholesome story, I love it :slightly_smiling_face:
Haha, it was very nice. I was so excited
I don't think it was bundled, I'm pretty sure my dad just thought it'd be cool
They don't have a 3DS emu on switch
Citra is the 3DS emu on PC and apparently works pretty well
But I'd actually recommend picking up a 3DS and hacking it and just getting all the games for it. Cause Fire Emblem is crazy good
I didn't play the 2nd, still enjopyed the shit out of the third
(Original is still best for just how out of left field the whole thing was)
Mei had mugs, and I had like 2 cups that I used for myself because I drank water.  So when Mei used my cups for things that needed to be cleaned more regularly I never had cups.
I wanted Smash 64 so bad that I bought it myself
So not that as much
I do remember getting the N64 for xmas and Jet force Gemini and making my aunt play with me
Ahhhhh got it
welcome to my house
play the music too loud
something somthing dun dun
we dont have to go out
i dont think i got any big gifts
i dont think i even asked for any
Be there if there is food
i have close to 0 food in a sad attempt to not binge eat
What a sad life you're living Aysh
i have about 4 pounds of german chocolate sitting unopened though - need to give it away
for le fam
Whoa
that's a lot of chocolate
you should melt it down and dip pretzels and strawberries in it
that is a problem we can help you with
Or you can give it to me. I like chocolate bc it is delicious
I looooved getting gifts. That Hanukkah was probably the best tho. Though the N64...
Got the console the same way as the GCN (disguised in a Macy's box). Turning on Diddy Kong Racing and seeing the rare logo and it in THREE DEE with diddy's laugh
Was just :magic:
My only gifts were my Harry Potter books and he mandatory gold jewellery mom would buy for me.
oh, and cash. people would give me cash
I HATED getting checks
Cause I had no way to cash them so it went into some nebulous bank account I never saw
lol, i generally was lazy and let them expire more than I want to admit
When you were a child?
Ages and ages ago?
Is it milk or dark chocolate?
Does it matter?
Yes, no milk only dark!
Allergies are things that matter
No dark, only milk
I loved the original. Still have it even.
Jam packed with walnuts?
Or hazlenuts?
Or just straight battery acid because let's face it, it would do the same thing as far as <@UPGVCMGD9> is concerned?
All chocolate is good unless you're alergic
I disagree
nah, no need for nuts in the chocolate
I've def had bad chocolate
Also what if you're a dog?
also in generally unrelated news, I started playing some modern warfare with a couple of hometown friends I used to play cod4 with; does anyone in here play?
though if nuts were required I'd go fo peanuts or almonds in chocolate, possibly cashews, but that should be cashews dipped in chocolate, not just cashews in chocolate bars
The newest one?
yeah
Can't say that I picked it up
Lots of crying about campers and insta-dead weapons
camping only becomes an issue when you're playing TDM/FFA as there aren't objectives
But you can be bothered to learn random coding languages just for the hell of it?
my one gripe with the game is that they turned dead silence into an activated ability rather than a perk
but it makes a sort of sense
Sorta? The goal is not to learn the language, but to build something interesting. Using an unfamiliar language is just part of the challenge
it was no commando though
See I mostly played MW2 as TDM or FFA
Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy those game modes
I've also become quite the r/patientgamers
I usually am as well
I started skyrim this year
Definitely counts
See I enjoy local multiplayer, or online but with a dedicated group of friends. Burned myself out from PUG groups or Lone wolf
I have a group of three that plays at least once per week
That's the way to do it
Maybe I'll get into StarCraft 2 enough to bring <@UDDE5960N> back in
I despise cleaning
Dota 2 tho
Fair definitely vomiting if there are nuts or battery acid.
Curious as to how the DotA vs LoL debate goes now that we have more people in this slack than just the original 4
I don't play either anymore :lol:
I used to keep up with League, but I dont even do that anymore
I've been playing a little bit of LoL only when friends are aorund
I basically binge URF when it comes out, and then don't even look at it again
I'm on and off league
I also binge urf
I don't play at all practically either. Only when my little cousin is playing and asks me to play
tried teamfight tactics as well
Cause I used to be pretty good at Dota
league can be a bit much to on-and-off. I feel like they change their systems a lot over time
I disagree
If you get into it once, you can fairly easily come back
a few new champs to learn
more the out of game stuff
like runes/masteries/whatever it is now
Dota was really the game I could humblebrag my skill about
Define humblebrag as you use it?
I could be brag about my MMR (skill rating) if anyone asked
Or if they didn't ask (usually)
How is that a humble brag?
Just sounds like a brag
Nah, a brag is when you come up with it on your own. But if someone asks you, you can be like "yea, I'm pretty good, I'm xyz MMR, but it's not really that important"
You use humblebrag very differently than I do. That to me is still a straight brag
Like a humblebrag as I understand the term is "Oh, I'm not that great a football player, I only have one super bowl ring"
almost asked about this drew
I have the same understanding as drew as to the definition
to me, `yea, I'm pretty good, I'm xyz MMR, but it's not really that important` is a brag, but you're just not being a dick about it
Yeah, it's being more polite. The humble part of a humble brag is the lack of acknowledgment of how great the thing is you're being dismissive of is.
example of your humble brag please?
Well, I suppose. Or maybe I just used the wrong definition to trigger this whole discussion as a humble-brag-ception
:galaxy-brain:
<@UHQD9J1SL>, I already gave the football one. 
Another example would be "I'm not a very good at Avalon, I only win 90% of the games I play"
that sounds more like one-downmanship
So what's your definition and example of a humblebrag?
This isn't a term I or Dave coined
thinking
i gogoled and most examples seem to be whining about something negative that arises from something positive/boast worthy
Ah, yea, I actually DID do that a lot with Dota
So I was right!
example?
I was like

&gt; Unfortunately, I could never really play with friends without doing silly stuff on smurfs because I was too good for them
Or
&gt; I really wish my friends were better so I could play with them for real and not have to do silly stuff to handicap myself
"an ostensibly modest or self-deprecating statement whose actual purpose is to draw attention to something of which one is proud."
Your statements aren't modest...they are just complaints
"make an ostensibly modest or self-deprecating statement with the actual intention of drawing attention to something of which one is proud."
&gt; In the study, college students were asked to write down how they'd answer a question about their biggest weakness in a job interview. Results showed that more than three-quarters of participants _humblebragged_, usually about being a perfectionist or working too hard
Good ol Merriam-Webster
Your rhetoric is astounding me...
/s
<https://twistedsifter.com/2011/05/funniest-humble-brags-on-twitter/>
"Next, they established that there are two distinct types of humblebrags. The first falls back on a complaint (“I hate that I look so young; even a 19-year-old hit on me!”) while the second relies on humility (“Why do I always get asked to work on the most important assignment?”). About 60% of the humblebrags people remembered fell into the complaint category."
<https://time.com/5095144/humblebrag-bragging/>
So I guess, you win? and by win I mean you've won the ire of others?
I guess humblebrags are just the best
But yea, sometimes I'd just outright brag. Cause I mean, if you're good at something, ya should be proud of it
I would argue you can be proud of something without bragging
That might be incredibly difficult, but I don't think bragging is a great way to win friends
Drew, you should do a humblebrag like
Type 1:
&gt; Eugh, it's so annoying that everyone always ask me to make them drinks all the time because they say they're amazing
Type 2:
&gt; I don't know why everyone asks me for drinks all the time, having a knowledge of several hundred drinks and different prep styles really isn't that hard
_should_?
why?
they're fun in sarcasm
*should*
I've 100% humblebragged about how I make my Old Fashioned without realizing it was a humblebrag, but that does not mean I should do that!
If anything this conversation has made me realize "Fuck, that's a humblebrag and I should definitely stop!"
:smile: keep going bruv
Take pride in what you do
Have a good night everyone! I'm jealous of everyone going home to their cozy apartments when I have to go back to my huge mansion with its built in pool
Get it?
so lonely att he top
Im so tired- I have traveled to 8 different cities in the last 30 days and have 3 more to go by New years
what 3 are left?
also, good humblebrag
So when are you inviting us to help alleviate the lonely apartment with pool?
san diego, yuma valley (lol) and pittsburgh
Dark chocolate!!! The first time I was in Switzerland I may had brought over 20 pounds of chocolate and probably ate at least half before I went home
Too much effort there's nothing humblebrag about this
It reads I'm a crazy person to me
Fuck that shit drew go for the brag! "Somebody get me a doctor! My back kills from carrying all these noobs!"
I've talked about this with 3 people now. Bragging apparently is ok given the right context and way it is done.
I mean, it's fine to be proud of something as long as you don't put others down
Good morning! 
Enjoy the 5 minute commute <@UETS9HTSS> 
Hope Race helped the commuter rail go faster <@UDDE5960N> 
Enjoy your travels or flight back depending on when it is <@UK7V13DS7> 
Not sure what you're doing these days but I'm sure it requires coffee, so enjoy <@UDD45P5A9> 
Are you alive <@UDBV9N1E0>?
Wakey wakey <@UDC4QL95G> 
I'm not sure your policy on pings these days Dave, so good morning!
<@UPGVCMGD9> this used to be a thing before summon the silent and we all got lazy. How early do you have to get to work?
So very lazy
Around 9ish, typically awake at 7ish
It did but it distracted me from building by campaign for :dnd:
Ah, good to know. The wake up call used to be around 7:30. I had to be at work by around 8-8:30 and CJ is just awake all the time
And Dave would be late to work so game night would have to start later. And Dakota legitimately was using this as a backup alarm
You're building a DnD campaign?
Ahhh yeah I mean I am sometimes awake at like 6am but my phone isn't on. I only turn it on once I am ready to deal with people lol
Yea for friends in RI
Not a bad way to do it. I use my phone as an alarm so can't afford to have it off
I just leave my phone on because I'm lazy
:disappointed:

hard disagree
Nop
Dota 2 is probably GotC
Game of the C.......?
Century. Was gonna say Decade, but dota has been out for longer than that. Dota 2 no, but it inherited most of them
Sounds dubious
Also sounds extremely subjective
Looking at lists of best games this century or most influential games this century, dota doesn't even make the lists
That's cause the lists are wrong
The masses have spoken
Do those other games have tournaments in the tens of millions?
You're the minority
I don't think so
hell, even within MOBAs, league is listed above dota
you can say that again
Cause the masses are wrong
Ima fine getting pings from actual people, bots are just :sideeye:

THAT'S HORRIFYING
I JUST REALIZED I'M GOING TO BE 28 IN A BIT OVER A MONTH
Yea, but you have a fiance and a house and things are cool
Ohhh you missed the newest problem
And I have a baby on the way
Oh my
That's vv exciting!
Congratulations!
(that's what people say when they hear a baby is coming, right?)
Depends on how the person announces the baby
in Cj's case, it was just a passing comment during a game night:
"oh yeah by the way mei is pregnant"
DO NOT SPEAK OF AGE HERE!
I mean.... that's what people. But yea and unexpected surprise
I hope that that is a good thing
So no Dave, I did not have my shit together at 28 and I still don't so the giphy is still correct
I feel like you're older than you look
Yea, but you probably did slightly more than me? So there's that
Like you're probably around my age
Tho I have  doggo
Nahhhhhhh
saturday i turn......30
:disappointed:
Wait, i thought you were a babby
In my head, yes
I thought everyone here was babby other than <@UDDE5960N>
And <@UDDE5960N> was just slightly older babby
we are all babbies
I got a good couple of years on you all
Can I go to the baby shower?
uhhhhhhhhhhh im not certain i want a thread about how we are old
Except maybe doug?
TOO LATE YOU'RE IN!
Doug is probably like, 24
i think doug is 30
probably 23
Uhhhhhhh.... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
You're asking the wrong person
He just pretends to be older to pick up chicks
he has been at wayfair like...3 years- thats not possible
I was under the impression that I was the youngest of us
<@UK7V13DS7> Can I go to the babby shower
though I also thought aysh was younger than me
humbebrag!
I thought you were Dakota
I thought it went Aysh, Dakota, Doug, Me, Drew, CJ
i'm 25, so doug is older than that if I am the youngest
I am going to screenshot this for the next time i feel old.
See? Babby
DOUG IS 30!!!
for reference
There's no Brenden or Marissa in that list
WE MUST STALK THIER AGES
I don't know those 2. Tbf, I don't know Aysh either, but I saw her out of the corner of my eye once so I based everything on that
:upside_down_blob:
my post college age 'time'line goes :
Job-&gt;Stable relationship-&gt;(Practically) Betrothed-&gt;(Practically) Married-&gt;(Practically) Having-in-laws-&gt;Having a child&gt; Having another child

In that order, but some parts may be skipped.
Brenden is 28.
How did you figure that out?
I KNOW.
Can everyone go back to thinking im 25, thanks
<@UDL020K8D> clarify
I'm at the Having a Child Step
But between Job -&gt; Stable relationship is Shit Show relationships
i was trying to be positive
But what about the Job-&gt;No relationship :forever_alone: True Combo?
thats called step 1 and that is why we're young Dave :stuck_out_tongue:
Wooo go step 1
so -Aysh, Dakota, Doug, Me, Drew, CJ - is still accurate!
Aysh, Dakota, Doug, Dave, Brenden, Drew, CJ
wait, accurate in what way?
in accordance with my aging timeline , making several assumptions about everyone's singleness/ parenthood
Hmmm why is dave ahead of doug?
somebody is playing with giphy
because I just edited Dave's own response to include his name.
Oh gotcha
wait, where is Victoria?
I remember her being older than I am, probably close to your age?
Went to lunch, what am I clarifying?
how old youare
Your age apparently
I’m 30. 
SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE? I KNOW
Brenden is not 28 he is lying
Go on.....
We need more info Marissa MORE INFO
Nah I am enjoying the guessing game. To be fair I forget his age a bunch but was recently reminded
That would also make it too easy for <@UETS9HTSS>  to give you my age if I just give up his.
I have no problem with the later
There are ways around mutually assured destruction.
no no no I enjoy so MAD with my chaos
I'm chosing to ignore you because you're a baby here
Shtahp
I am older than some and younger than others
younger than some newborns, older than some mountains
:mind_blown:
faster than a speeding bullet
Dave- please you is a baby
I am oldm an
I am not baby
I am like :older_man:
think about what youre implying, Dave :@
I don't like thinking
but yeah, if you feel grown up then thats all :disappointed: its over
It makes me feel old
You're not an old man because that makes me and older man and I refuse!
You have a wife and a fetus, you're an adult now
(is that gross to say?)
(not sure if that was crossing the line)
gross? not really
weird? probably
Resistant Adult
I don't wanna be
Fetus is interesting
ok kool
Having a fetus makes it sound like you are carrying it in a jar :face_with_open_mouth_vomiting:
It's better than <@UK7V13DS7> crying about how she has a parasite inside her that hates her
first time i heard, Mei called it a 'parasite' and I thought she hd a stomach bug
yuppppppppppppppp
CJ doesn’t have a wife yet just a baby mama soon 
I have a parasite inside me.... it sucks..., I puked again
(Practically) the same
Random fact: It’s optional to put dads name on the birth certificate ;p 
Moms name is mandatory I think
i like that
I told CJ if he’s not nice to me the dad name may be blank. He wasn’t happy with this 
Who uses the word fetus? So weird
as opposed to parasite? :raised_eyebrow:
beat me to it
No parasite is way better. It's inside you sucking away resources
Nah, parasite isn't accurate
Cause it's mutually beneficial
I have a cuddle munchkin who is trying to set the world record of puking
out of curiosity, how is it mutually beneficial?
thats a symbiote though right?
No clue
I don't think the baby is benificial for the mother
They get to live in your tummy rent free and get free food.

You get to pass along your genes and continue the human race
It's much more beneficial for the father, but still
I'm going with it needs to wipe my bum when I'm old
the latter being categorized as a benefit isn't a given
VENGEANCE SHALL BE MINE!!!!
also it's indirect
and a dedicated lawn mower
and driveway shovler
hah, you can hire those for much cheaper than a child
true but you gotta take wins where you can get them at that point
But there's not the level of satisfaction watching from the warmth of the house
babies are cute. thats the benefit.
So conclusions from thread thus far:
1. Dave is Old
2. Brenden has an age
3. Babies are parasites 
Babies are cure in the same way pugs are
Ewwww babies are way cuter than pugs
Also I dispute 1, because everyone but dave has the conclusion of `Dave is a baby`
With the transitive property we can now assert dave is also a parasite. Along with Dakota
actually dough and Aysh are included in the group of parasites since we also established that the order of age is as follows:
Aysh, Dakota, Doug, Dave, Brenden, Drew, CJ
:preach:
Well your order is wrong because Aysh is older than Dave she just wants people thinking she's younger
i didnt ask anyone to :stuck_out_tongue:
`in accordance with my aging timeline , making several assumptions about everyone's singleness/ parenthood`
we are clearly going off of the TRUE age scale, not simple revolutions around the sun
Got it.... WAIT I DON'T WANT TO BE THE OLDEST!!!! Drew is _*ACTUALLY MARRIED*_ therefor the oldest
having a baby will change you CJ
it is but the natural course
you are the oldest by the simple fact that you have brought new life into the world
Man <@UDC03KCGK> picked a bad day to not look at slack
or perhaps he picked a great day
Mei is currently the youngest since she is 50% parasite
Bad cuz he is going to have a 100+ meessage thread to read through, regardless of the content
yes- because he WILL sit and read through them
fair
Wait, if Dave is A Baby, and Babies are parasites, and Mei is younger then dave, then may is already a parasite. Since she is carrying a baby, doesnt' that make her 150% parasite?
or maybe mei and dave are really just the same person
<@UDDE5960N> you're marrying dave
Mei is not intrinsically a parasite, she is just being controlled by one temporarily
it was so weird when the Richard bot called Mei munchkin or something :shudder:
Dave. how can you call yourself ugly like that- come on!
Pugs also aren't cute, but that's okay
I donut how people think babies are cute
i also donut
I do not donut
Like, toddlers? Yea, they can be cute, and so can small kids. But babies?
They're not cute
Every phase of life &gt; baby can be cute
theyre adorable. theyre a pain but they are adorable.
All broad generalizations are a bad idea
:wink:
Give me a picture of a baby that is cute or adorable and I'll tell you no, it's not cute
I don't think pugs are cute either
YOUR FACE IS CUTE
:awshucks:
That is not cute
It's so weird
All babies look the same and they're gross
I don't understand people who are like "cute baby"
No
It's not. It looks like all other babies and I don't want to touch or hold it or play with it
Let me know when it's old enough to play video games
To be fair, smaller versions everyday things are often seen as being cute
But that's the thing
babies aren't smaller versions of us
what are they then?
demons?
babies are poor helpless little things that we are biologically tuned to take care of so we find endearing and cute . i understand your opinion is different but this is generally the case
did you have younger siblings Dave?
Look at that? The proportions are horrifying
Anything not cute is automatically a demon
No, I have 1 older brother
what makes it horrifying?
thats what makes them cuter!
are you calling all dwarfs/midgets/small people horrifying?
I mean, a 6 foot tall baby would be pretty terrifying
big eyes and heads and wobble wobble
I'm with dakota on this, Chibi is cute, full size Chibi is :kill_it_with_fire:
.............they also dont exist
Babies are tiny devil
Babies are not cute, mine is going to look like CJ 
Yea I’m horrifying!! Be scare of me
No one is scared of you Sweetie
Responding to brendens comment 
I think half-CJ/half-Mei would be a cute child
I like the way that a good portion of today's activity is Dave posting to our thread and to the general chat
But not baby. Cause babies are terrifying
Dave, I am totally going to hand my child off to you to listen to you scream in terror
no that is not happening
I can babysit once they get older
But I donut do babies
People tell me to hold the babby
I'm just gonna chase you around with it
You know for _*SCIENCE*_
But I'm afraid I'm going to drop it and then it lands on its head and then it gets a concussion and then it has to go to the babby ICU and then it slowly dies as it drains you and Mei of all your money in a vain attempt to keep it alive and then i get arrested and then i get tried for manslaughter and then i go to jail and then i die in jail
well that was elaborate
Everything in the but the _we spend all our money trying to keep it alive_ may come true
Mei would never spend that much money anything
We'll find out. You have no idea how hard I will laugh if that happens with Mei
youre going to rop your baby at some point and itll be fine...i mean, why else did we all turn out this way?
I mean they're just little balls of goo, it's not like there's anything that solid in them
Dave, what do you think of Baby Yoda
dave, why are you sending all these messages to the channel?
Alien babies are superior to human babies
CJ and CJ app was right. I’m not spending crazy amount of $$ to keep it alive. 
I like Dave’s elaborate future of what happens if he holds a baby lol 
That baby can use luck to stay alive 
Because they're channel things
&gt; Alien babies are superior to human babies
See, I've had many times of being asked to hold a babby. I know what will happen
Can someone wake me up from this nightmare
But will mei allow the baby to have surgery?
you know, when Dave drops it
You'll probably be wonderful parents
Or maybe not. But probably
I mean, having a good pet name for your loved ones is probably the most important part
And Munchkin is great, so I'm sure you'll have a good one for your kid
lol Dave, I'm just evil
at least you aren't a parasite
though if ur not cute ur a demon
so yeah evil
All caps, followed by a Massive thread
It’s official name is asshole raspberry Okeefe
No surgery too expensive
That's not her official name Mei
It is!!!! 
That can be her Chinese name
Then I can make her English name elizabeth, EVERYONE WINS!
Elizabeth counts as a win?
Name her Protoss
Vs Asshole Raspberry?
I mean... I would like my child to not be the one left in the corner alone
Asshole Rasberry in chinese, Protoss in English
Are we doing a baby name contest????
Does a worst baby name contest count?
I would prefer not to.... Mei will win and then I'll have to deal with a new even worse name
Winning is good though
<@UDBGH9BMX> :hyper-smug:
I feel like that was meant for you
Gasp
Don't name her Elizabeth, my brothers ex wife is named Elizabeth
But then I could call her so many different things
You're welcome
There are a lot of names like that
I've found that someone will always have a problem with names
Then just don’t give her a name. 
There is one name that is the best name, but it's mine for my daughter if :forever_alone: somehow doesn't happen
Noname O'Keefe
close
Dave
Not at all, David is such a boring name
Pretty sure Terror O'Keefe will be the phrase said often
Not for a girl
It's still a boring name
Little Jimmy DropTables. 
<http://Xkcd.com/327|Xkcd.com/327>
That's funny but too much effort
Just name her CJ. Says it’s after the West Wing character, pretend to make the connection to your name every time people mention it. 
Name her something irish. Irish have the best names
“Something Irish O’Keefe”
Silly Doug, that's not what I meant
“Silly Doug, that’s not what I meant O’Keefe” is a weird name suggestion. 
Jeeva lebanah. I had a friend called that. Apparently it's from the Bible?
I don’t know that one. 
Oh seems it's Hebrew for moon
Anyway, four leaf clover O'Keefe. My entry
Cinderella
And then everyone asks if she's named after the Disney movie and you look at them weird and be like "no"
Aysh what are you named after?
Jyo’s name is about the moon, right?
Moonlight is her name.
I'm named after the goddess of wealth... who represents all kinds of wealth (like courage, education, cattle, offspring etc etc) but I'm the version that's the goddess of money :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Googled, Goddess of prosperity
And fortune
So yeah. All the good stuff
And now I want to name her for a goddess of chaos
Chaos is a form of wealth, for those in the know
Eris is greek, Discordia is Roman
The wheel of fortune. 
Wealth and fortune/misfortune ties together. 
That's on me. I apologise
You were born January '92?
I'm already 28 and I'm a bartender after getting fired from being a real adult with an office job...
So, killing it?
CJ wants stupid Long British names
Train is broke, I am sad
I am broke. I am sad.
Also wait, Dave, your brother has an ex-wife???
Also why does Jyo keep getting name dropped. How does he relate to Aysh?
Fucking good morning <@UHQD9J1SL>!
Where is your mind <@UDD45P5A9>?
Elizabeth? <@UDDE5960N> 
150% parasite <@UK7V13DS7> 
Send the search party <@UDBV9N1E0> 
Going to be cursed with a baby some day <@UDBGH9BMX> 
Weirdly the voice of reason in yesterday's thread <@UDC4QL95G> 
Why does Jyo keep getting brought up? <@UDL020K8D>
Probably still kidnapped and DEFINITELY NOT 28 <@UETS9HTSS> 
Already awake but phone might not be <@UPGVCMGD9> 
I SEE YOU STILL LURKING <@UDTR9SLN4>
OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE!
HAHAHAHA!!!!
That is my Favorite bot!
Welp, good morning
I just want you to know I'm laughing out loud right now
As you should be
Fucking good morning <@UHQD9J1SL>!

Elizabeth? <@UDDE5960N> 
Why does Jyo keep getting brought up? <@UDL020K8D> 
Definitely going to be cursed with a baby someday <@UDBGH9BMX>

Blame a combination of the scrambler bot and my OCD for the double ping
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I think its appropriate amount of posts before it triggers
Or do you want less?
It is now
Now you must learn to code for your vengeance!
It has to happen enough for me to be gun shy, but rare enough for me to not be copying and select all for every couple posts.
Yeah, although I have to learn to code for many reasons now. At the fore front being paying for health insurance that I can't trust I'll get through work anymore.
Love it! Good morning Drew!!!!
Yesterday was not a good day, hence me checking slack before 10 and then being lost to the void till past 11pm
I think it needs to be more rare then it should come outta no where
I think I set it to like 1/100
This crazy nonsense is SPEAKING to me!
I'll probably drop it when I get in. I don't want you to think about it when your posting till BAM
Drop it to even rarer???
Ohhhh? The new job doesn't do benefits?
Yea
I mean that was basically the pinnacle moment right there. Long ass post and I hadn't seen it in quite a while
Hahahahaha true
That's the whole reason I created it!
So making it even rarer would mean you're probably going to get it only on some dumb 5 word post
That wouldn't be satisfying. I already forgot about it here
Jyo is a girl that introduced Doug and me and continues to tolerate the both of us
Wait, Dave. You have a brother????
Ok
Some days I wonder about you aysh
It does, which is why I thought I was fine. 
Basically I keep getting scheduled for less than 30 hours, which I need for qualifying for benefits. 
But people who were hired after me are getting the appropriate number of shifts
And there are people they are working into the fucking ground. 
But I'm not doing anything wrong, they like my work a lot and want more bar tenders like me...
I tried to pick up a shift for tonight after only having 3 this whole week.
I got denied!
That's fucking dumb
I asked about getting 5 shifts. 
They scheduled me for a 5th one. 
On Sunday. Literally the only day I said I can't work
So yeah, need to start finding other sources of income because this is not the stable bartending job I thought it would be.
Bummer
Can I opt out of this bot? My phones on Do not disturb, so I don’t get anything out of a ping at 8am. 
That's not a bot that's drew. The bot randomize Drew's post
I know. It’s just a human powered algorithm.  It really much different. 
Still, I’d prefer not having a slack notification everyday when I wake up. Every once in a while? Sure. Every day? Ugh. 
:smh:
Lol
I never said I was 28
Good Morning Drew!
:sadpotato:
I have a brother and the ex wife thing is complicated and completely not immigration fraud but is technically correct
I don't hate babies. I'd love to have 2.5 one day. But I'm terrified of them and they aren't cute. They're much better when they can feed and poop themselves
yup had me laughing out loud as well
kinda sad that I made it to the third line before I realized what was going on
LOL!
`150% day <@UDDE5960N>`
I will vouch that Brian exists and is pretty kick ass.  Did not know he was married
Wellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
is that `welllllll` directed towards the `Brian exists` or the `is pretty kick ass`
I've got slack events being recorded in an AWS NoSQL DB. Let me know of any ideas about what to do with that kind of capability
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
:uhh:
:uhhhhh:
:porquenolosdos:
Like all slack events????
Currently I am only storing messages, but you have a point
Create a markov chain generator for messages
My bot idea is to yell at a person playing with giphy
It is now storing ALL events
Better than the boring pick n choose one
edits, delete, join channel etc
so probability goes up for each new giphy you play with
But only once per giphy play
it appears to not notice playing with giphy
Booooooo
Prometheus &gt; Ralph
I'm not acutally sure why this bot doesn't notice giphy

Well it uses the same slack events.
And yet Prometheus &gt; Ralph

Let's play Tragedy Looper on Friday
You know what would be fun horrible awful amazing?
Trying to play through all of a TL expansion in 1 day

If we do TL do we
A: jump right into the expansion
B: Have me yolo Day 9
C: Skip to Day 10
B
Or maybe we do a script or 2 of the xpack to get us back up to speed
Before doing a 3 hr script 9
Aw man, I miss that game
is Aysh actually being censored? or is she literally typing in "hidden message"?
Um, I still have a party tomorrow. So yeah, not going to be doing TL in the middle of it
Was yoke
Sorry, was not clear yoke
Oh, also, speaking of humble brags, I just heard a great one from a coworker:
(female coworker bc it matters for context):
&gt; Omg, I must have gotten the last extra small dress they had in stock!
Mehhhh it would have been better if "Its so hard to find extra small dress because so few girls are that size!"
why is being short a brag?
Not short, small -&gt; thin is sexy
small and thin are different things.
thin and sexy are also different things

I don't disagree, I'm saying the general perception is
oh, is Aysh trying to hide things from AWS? Is that why the text is in images?

Ahhh I get it now
her messages also cant get deja-vu'd
Thanks CJ, while I was away, you got my back and explained it well

I could never do a call center this is has got to be a boring terrible job
Was this in response to something?
No, cause he'd never do a call center
(it was supposed to be a joke about how call center employees `respond` to phones all day, but it kinda didnt' work as well on the screen as it did on my phone)
Has anyone played Champions of Midgard? Cause I got that for my dog walker for Christmas
no, but I've only head good things
I've been making outbound calls for peak and this is terrible
oh, that makes more sense
Wait, so you're a telemarketer now?
I think this is customer service related
Ops around if the customer will be home for their delivery
Because they're too lazy to engage with any of our automated tools
Lazy customers
Ah, scheduling the deliveries
Are you like "Hey, I'm CJ and this isn't my job, but you lazy bums don't know how computers work so I have to call you and ask you about deliveries"
I keep getting notified that Slack is ending support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1
Are people using an old version of the app? Does this affect the bots?
I presume it also is just "Too much email, why do I care about this?"
Most people haven't bought furniture online. When they do, the aren't getting it delivered by a truck, but by Fed ex. It's a strange interaction to schedule a delivery if you didn't do that already at the store
More like "Hey customer this is coming tomorrow between x and y does that work.  Oh it does great!"
I'm on slack 4.2.0
upgrading should not affect the bots
oh, app on mobile or desktop?
eh, either way, you should upgrade
Not nearly spicy enough for me
Needs more CJ sarcasm
Fatherhood is mellowing you out...
Bots are totally independent of your slack.  They get JSON files that we parse
I'm not allowed to be sarcastic with customers
Everyone on my team freaks out because I have a "Nice voice"
My analyst literally just laughs every time she hears it
Is it like your slack picture?
The regular link compared to dark link?
Uhhhhhh expect I always play as dark link
He was actually my favorite skin in Melee
He's not in melee tho?
I don't know actually, is he?
That's what I'm saying tho, you usually use your dark link voice, but when you're on a phone with a customer, you use your regular link voice
Link is in, there's a dark link skin
Hmmmmm I thought there was a legit Dark link skin
Oh well
It's been a long time since I meleed properly
There is one in ultimate, I think there was in brawl
Awkward
It's just now that I realized why that made very little sense
Marriage fraud is time consuming and low ROI
Of course that's what you weigh in on
ROI
:lolguy:
I mean, CJ is probably the biggest Investment you've ever made <@UK7V13DS7>
As far as brian did, it's not Marriage Fraud, mainly immigration fraud
I mean, it's not that either, but it's funnier if I say it that way
She's a citizen silly Dave.  She keeps me around for..... I don't really know.... I keep her around cause she makes me laugh
I'm not saying that Mei isn't... I'm saying that that's why Brian got married
I hope everyone in this channel has a wonderful evening! :slightly_smiling_face:
There was in Brawl
Found who the TLS affects.
<@UDTR9SLN4>
Looks like it is your phone
TLS?
Transportation Layer Security
It's something I've been getting slack emails from saying they will stop updating for it in February
Seems she's using an outdated app or something about her phone.
Trying to open this thread was a mistake
Good morning!

That is the wrong uhoh emoji sir
:uhoh:
Is the only valid uhoh emoji
Didn't doug ask specifically to not be pinged in the morning?
yes
Yes. 
<@UDC03KCGK> :this:
Well, now I have been reminded
Sorry!
Based on what rules?
The rules of the street
The cause of extra emails?
hahaha. why do you think it's me?
(I have no idea what these emails are, so I can't confirm or deny)
Also, why would you be getting these emails instead of me?
...oh man, you're like the last person that I can take seriously saying that
You mean you don't believe me that I know the rules from the hood about proper emoji usage from the days I spent on the streets?
I know it is you, because Slack gave me a readout of affect users, and it was literally just "marla"
These emails are about an outdated app
They send them to me because I'm the slack owner and primary admin. 
Why they don't send you those as well is a good question.
Basically to the best of my knowledge, you just have to update slack on your phone
You're not someone I see near the hood ever in your life.
I'm pretty sure I could hand you a pocket knife and you wouldn't know how to close it
Hey, those things are sharp
I thought the more questionable thing would be that the street has rules about emoji usage...
also, what is the redacted meme?
I see
Using phone
Worked!!!!
Hello everybody!
Hello!
:guh:
Hi
Banned word of the day. It's a bot. 
Today's word is two, but you know, not too or two. The 3rd one
guh
to
no, I don't understand
It's opt in for bots. You have not opted in, so it will not affect you
I don't want to work
I'm not dead, just currently in Hawaii with spotty service
That's like, the best news. Good for you!
Thanks, its my first real vacation is ever
nice
<@UDC03KCGK> could you have your cookie party at my apartment instead so i don't have to travel?
where's a cookie party?
I feel like I've missed so much
The timing is real tough for me though
Ohhh fuck that who knows well i'll get home
I'm sad now I won't get cookies
DAMN YOU DAVE!
I posted it twice. Not sure what else I could have done. Dropped it into other conversations. After that it would have just been annoying and desperate and sad
Nah I forgot because I knew I couldn't go
That's on me not you
I'm probably going to bring store cookies because I don't have time to bake
That is lame <@UDBGH9BMX>
Thanks
Do better <@UDBGH9BMX>
Yea make the store bought cookies at least!
Because that's somehow better
You know that storebought cookies didn't require you to add the egg originally? They found in marketing that people didn't feel like they were doing enough, so they took out the dehydrated egg so that housewives felt like they were actually "baking."

Happy birthday <@UHQD9J1SL>!!!
Thank you!!!!
Turns out this isn’t even technically true.

There is also suggestion that climate change contributed to the collapse of the Minoans. And the rise of the Mongols. 
clearly they weren't sacrificing enough people doug!
The mayans weren't sacrificing enough people??
Just like `More Pylons Required` the mayans needed `more sacrifices required`
Spawn more overlords. Zerg only in the channel.
lol
I just thought it was neat idea
really that's the ban word for the day!?!?!?!
it it it it it
Happy Birthday person I've only ever met out of the corner of my eye but seems like a nice person who I wish well to!
(a few days ago)
lol
Aysh is the chaotic good goddess
Happy Late Birthday!
Thank youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Good mornng and happy monday everybody!
Good Morning Aysh
IS IT CHRISTMAS YET? Also, can we do :ath::ere:'s in this channel or is that no bueno?
I'd imagine it would be frowned upon
Do you really want to reignite the ping wars Dave? Our technology has grown significantly since the last time.
hmmm i wonder if bots :ath::ere: works
I don't see why not
well because if a bot uses `@dquealy` it will not ping me. I need to use `&lt;My ID&gt;` to make it ping me
Well yea, we'd need to identify the :ath::ere: id in order to do it
`<!here>`
found it
Told you
huh... I could probably use AWS to control the emoji bot...
Is it Chritsmas yest?
:no:
iohno
is it yet?
It won't be christmas for another 8 days and 12 hours
oh god 8 days?
i need to buy things
8 days more
another 8 days another destiny
when did christmas go from "i can way to get presents" to "oh god i have so many people to buy for"
Look at this guy
With friends to buy things for
:lol: :no: just family

/megamoji wow :baby-yoda-train: :baby-yoda-reverse:
Its like the Viridian City Gym
I was thinking the casino basement, but same concept
yeah, me a Warlin are on the exact same page.
Warlin was one of my labsters
:tiny_snek_woh:
And now all i can think about is twitch plays :pokemon:

Anyone flying for the holidays?
what're you dong?
yup i am
I'm bored.... and I don't want to do some of the stuff i can do
what are the current options?
But I will not be traveling for the holidays
Write up pilots that need to be run
Uhhhh that's really about it because I have no idea where people want to go forward because so much has changed in our org
Guess you gotta write a new prometheus bot
or come up with an idea for a new bot
all bot ideas must come with a plan to defeat said bot if it turns against humanity
write a bot that makes prometheus encourage us to plan game nights
I'm flying
nice where to?
dw, I'm back so I'll do that
:sounds_like_a_me_problem:
Good morning! It is a morning and it is good!
<@UDDE5960N> slacking much?
<@UDC03KCGK> what's a cooking in the noggin?
<@UDL020K8D> yes- you dont like pings- sue me :@
<@UDBGH9BMX> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3s7ag6xKQ> HOW COULD YOU NOT
<@UDC4QL95G> Did I get everyone?
<@UETS9HTSS> I didn't forget you!
<@UPGVCMGD9> I'll add you too!
Add me to what?
Good morning!
Seriously?
Lol O'Stabby. I thought I was already on the good morning bot
There's no Good Morning bot, just humans that don't pay attention to what doug wants
:suspicious:
Lol poor Doug :joy:
<@UETS9HTSS> I was checking if Dakota was paying attention
Good morning to you too <@UPGVCMGD9>!
Thanks :) Good morning :sun_with_face: <@UHQD9J1SL>  and <@UDDE5960N>
I was in the train so i was not paying any attention
You say this like you normally pay attention
true. If i'm not at work slack is pretty much dead to me
Along with the rest of your phone
Mostly martinis
Speaking of dead phones
My phone's battery lasts about 1.5 hrs. That's all. It sometimes doesn't make it my whole ride home/in to the office
Uhhhh you should probably get a new phone/battery
or go off the grid entirely
I would. But the place that fixes phones is only open during the workday
hey <@UHQD9J1SL> where do you sit?
are you in copley?
yes, floor 6 :slightly_smiling_face: whats us
I used to sit up there!
I was at the border of T1 and T4
along the window walkway
exactly the same!
:a_blob_wow:
:mind_blown:
do your ex colleagues still sit here?
HAHAHAHA THE UPLOAD SPLIT EMOJIS!

I feel like this is a room my character has to dodge roll through.
<@UHQD9J1SL> WHY IS THERE A SPACE BETWEEN EACH ONE OF THESE???????
nope!
not each. there are a couple without spaces. which somehow makes it worse
I tried- just didnt try  hard enoguh

oh i just realized what you meant- those weren't spaces. each line is the reverse of the other
just got sent an mr for review titled: `integrate create template variant api with ui phub`

do I dare ask what phub is?
`jargon jargon jargon jargon jargon`
you phool
my everspace 2 steam key arrived today :kermit_stoked:
makes me want to buy a vr headset
I just bought boneworks a few days ago on steam and it has been super fun in vr. One of my controllers refuses to press right on the D-pad so i'll probably be looking to get some Valve Index controllers soon
I imagine everspace would be pretty amazing in vr
Once I finish boneworks, I could probably lend you my vive for a few days to help you decide if you wanna buy one yourself
I was thinking of buying Everspace a few days ago when it was on sale on fanatical
But decided not to bc I just have far too many games, especially roguelikes
well worth it IMO
I nearly  have 100% completion
It was.. $5.47?
I don't recall
I'm saying on fanatical. It was a pretty good sale
Everspace is a roguelike?
sort of
it is, but you get money that carries over between rounds
It's *free* with xbox game pass for pc, but it doesn't have the expansion, which I heard makes it infinitely better
so you can upgrade the pilot/ships
but every time you die, you start back at sector 1
it's all randomly generated, so it's not like it's repetitive in that fashion
interesting. i might have to look into it some time
I have so many roguelikes tho...
Tho, realtalk right now again. I *might* have plugged it in this channel, but FULL METAL FURIES is a fantastic game
Not incredibly long, but just the right length
<https://youtu.be/YtDy51HYYbw?t=355>
And the puzzles are amazing
you had me at `From the creators of Rogue Legacy`
It seems like a brawler, but it's actually funny with clever writing, likeable characters, a surprisingly smart story, and the brawling part is only 75% of the game
it's NOTHING like rogue legacy
But it's so good
Play it MP tho. I'm sure it's fun single player, but it shines in MP
oh, I thought he was going to fight the corvette
damn it
I like fighting the corvettes and frigates
it feels so satisfying and dangerous
Don't look up the puzzles tho - it's so satisfying to figure them out yourself
I'm so confused as to what Everspace is now
found a much better video
<https://youtu.be/hzmjXsEv1rs?t=40>
that third person ship view doesn't seem like it would do too well with VR
no, that's what I use on pc normally
I'd go to first person in VR
yes but what do I do. Just blow stuff up?
you're collecting resources and defending yourself against the okkar and raiders in each sector
upgrading your ship and such as you progress
Have u ever played a roguelike before? :smile:
you get to the end of sector 9 or something and then fight a boss
if you win, game over and you progress the story
Soooo 3-D FTL?
yes
I always thought it was more like Elite Dangerous with permadeath
where there are no "levels", just a huge open world to upgrade your ship and stuff
That's what I had thought of getting. But I was like, :meh: I have too many games
Love the idea of 3-d space games, not enough time or desire to play them :disappointed:
wait, did you get into some sorta beta or something? I am seeing relase date 2021
yessir
kickstarter
or something similar
I get to play early
:hy::pe:
Nice, whats there rest of the email... for uhhh... science
heh
<@UDDE5960N> i need a new bot idea
or <@UDC03KCGK> or <@UETS9HTSS> or <@UDC03KCGK>
a bot that generates bot ideas.
wat
too hard
<https://www.kamogo.com/5>
lol
this is an old bot
I think cj made this to annoy dakota
sometimes it pings drew too
do I get 4 in a row?
aww
:rip:
I think that was one of CJ's first bots
it was his _*first*_ bot
IIRC
I also experimented with random profile pictures for bots, thus the robot
you can use all our text as a corpus, pass it into a learning algorithm, see how the bot learns to talk. have it say stuff every now and then. should be able to use openNN for something free like that on python
like
<https://twitter.com/roborosewater?lang=en>
but for us instead of MtG
hmmm give it a statement, and have it simulate a conversation based on threads we have created in teh past
unfortunately, the amount of training data I would have for that is limited, since dejavu only stores the text, and not the tread it was part of
all the better.
it learns how to speak out of context
Markov chain based on that person
Yea this was when Dakota first gave us Python access.  Because Megamoji was written in JS(?) and I was too lazy to learn the syntax, so I convinced him to do Python
Hence the name Prometheus, and the `Gave us fire`.  Sometimes it will tell him he opened pandora's box by doing so
Good Morning!
Summon the Silent
I slept in, hence no fancy individualized wake up
:yay:
The first yay emoji, the most base yay emoji, is Luffy?
I should be able to play tomorrow and meet you
I most likely cannot play tomorrow.
That's a horrifying gif if you watch it for more than 5 seconds
.....what?
I'm doing dinner with Mei's family tomorrow so I am also out
I'm going to star wars in CT tomorrow and am there through Christmas :sweat:
gah!
2020 then?
there are carolers in Copley
I did not see a harp in boylston today :disappointed:
Harp?
there was a lady playing a harp in the main entrance yesterday
Ohhhhh, nothing in Berkley like that
guys guys guys (and gals)
I'm excited
Cause
My car is finally legal again!
:doot: :doot: :choir: :high-fiving-a-million-angels:
Why is the :doot: emoji different in this workspace than the WF one
why was your car illegal????
too much street racing
I... uh... never registered it in MA
And my CT registration ran out in May
ah- so it wasnt insured till now either?
Welllllllllllllllllllllllll
I paid for insurance
lol
Whether it would have been covered had I gotten into an accident or not is questionable
Focus is toasted
wut
It means I'm all done focusing for the day
That's my favorite part of the day
Did you fill out your peer reviewers yet?
Yes all 5 of them
I struggled for a bit to get to 5
BUT I DID IT!
BITCHES!
What about you
yeah I finished right before i asked if you had yet
I've been working with 3 different teams so I had no problem this time around getting peer reviewers
You suck
I just got an email saying I have been reimbursed for the board games I bought for my team on amazon
Leftover pod outing money is the best
LOL!
Too bad we always use all of ourse
in fact we generally go over
I mean if one person cant make it to one, BOOM thats a boardgame
we are really bad at planning pod outings, so we usually just half ass it
lol
Generally we just grab team dinners
people on my team refuse to have after work pod outings
when do you do them instead?
usually either like 2-4 or like 12-2
depends on what we decide
honestly, that sounds great, unless they're always in the office
not always. We've gone bowling and to an escape room as well
Full Metal Furies
No
Not a fucking chancd
I mean, I *did* pay them 2.1k dollars...
But they'd probably weasel out of it because I wasn't registered
It wouldn't be hard. It's buried in your contract
Good Morning!
<@UHQD9J1SL> has a new game but no one to play it
<@UDBGH9BMX> has gone full Furry
<@UETS9HTSS> a refugee from his own bedroom
<@UDC4QL95G> maybe finally bought a plane ticket for Christmas
<@UDDE5960N> potentially has a daughter with a nose flatter than his
<@UK7V13DS7> pregnant, which is a catch all
Doug, who dislikes pings
<@UDD45P5A9> said fuck you to snow and ran to Hawaii
<@UPGVCMGD9> this will be one of the few things in chaos monkey she actually reads today
<@UDBV9N1E0> MIA
<@UE2D3HCBW> KIA
<@UDTR9SLN4> Undercover
<@UJTEHPEPL> probably never put slack on his phone
Lol you are totally right <@UDC03KCGK>
Fury*
No no Dave, no taking the back the fact you put Furries in all the channels
Also it's brutally cold outside today
.... what's kia
That's a great hold morning! Good mot, Drew :relieved:
In this context, Ion this context, I think Drew is going for Killed In Action. 
Correct
MIA is missing in action
KIA is Killed in Action
Kia is also a car brand and Mia is a woman’s name. Although Drew did them in all caps, so more likely the acronyms. 
It's doubtful that Will is a Kia
Sometimes people can be cars. 
That' seems creepy because the girl is _*in*_ the guy
Yup. 
When you're bored and nonwork politics is being quiet
Didn’t a huge political event happen last night?  They aren’t talking about it?
Nope there's like 2 posts about it
Weird. 
Yea.... they're so weird that's why it's fun to watch
A person on my team became an American citizen two days ago. 
Nice
It's daunting how many years of work go into that
Yup. It’s a bit of funny timing is all. 
Well hopefully we live up to the standard and kick him out
Wow, I didn't think I needed to clarify those acronyms. CJ got it instantly
I also got them instantly
Someone did make a point on all the Reddit impeachment threads about how it's very difficult to become an American citizen, but that's it's pretty difficult to become a citizen of any first world country.
Kinda wish the politics channel wasn't such an echo chamber
we need to convince a few trump supporters to speak up and get the ball rolling
Go on
hmm? that was the end of the thought
As in, what would they say that you think should be said?
That's a CJ comment if I've ever seen one
It's fun to guess who said the original comment. I'm not sure if we ever get the fake profile and the comment to line up exactly
echo
echo
echo
No it's still random
But potentially deja Vu could get the original speaker right?
More like there should be dissident but they literally become the mob that they hate it's super annoying
Justice has been served
Only if we tracked who said what, right now we just track what was said
Doug had never seen the discussion behind that comment. We never made it far enough for me to make it
We can't find archived channels?
Ctrl+K
^ Drew
then type in the channel name
But that's perfect. Means there's a 1/X chance that whoever made the original comment randomly gets paired with who originally said it. There's no bias against the original speaker, so we can never fully count on it NOT being from the profile deja vu picked
I think I can unarchive it
I forgot why I found that
But it's great an everyone needs to see it
I found why I forgot
Yeah, this was the real motivation behind why I asked if I could morph into a Hippo
I'm now playing a moon druid in my tuesday campaign
you can
Thoughts?
well, Moon Druid 2, Bear Totem Barbarian 3
so I'm a Bearbarian
I'm a raging brown bear
raging makes me resist all but psychic damage while in bear form
so it basically doubles my effective hp
then I can reckless attack for advantage on mauling you as a bear
and get +2 damage for raging
everyone else is ranged, so I needed to be the meat shield
ITT: BoTh SiDeS aRe ThE sAmE
:spiderman-pointing-left::spiderman-pointing-right:
Why brown bear and not Hyena or Tiger?
at one point, I stored who said the phrase along with what was said, and the bot impersonated the person who said it. Drew didn't like that and made me change it
1. Multiattack
2. Climbing Speed
3. Flavor
Cause bearbarian!
I prefer it this way, because it means there's an extra game of figuring out who said the comment. Like right now
Barbearian
All you're doing is confirming that you not storing who said it, meaning it can come up that the comment was made by that person. Or not. It's true random, not biased random.
trump did nothing wrong, the impeachment is a hoax, trump broke no laws, democrats are just trying to take over the whitehouse etc
You think that SHOULD be said? Because you think it is unfairly represented, or just because you want to stir the pot?
other cool options:
1. Crag Cat
2. Cranium Rat
3. Street Rat - steal magic lamps
Are these specific to being a barbarian moon druid?
no
you could have used them
So these are just options I never used
yes
Technically you can become a swarm as well, but that's a bit of a gray area
They aren't in my druidshape app or in the book
So I wouldn't have known
need to look at all your options ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
crag cat is :fire:
But those were lined out as all my options
eh, for first time players, limiting the number of options to look at is useful.
Like where do lists of these exist? Are they homebrew
<https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/crag-cat>
it's from one of the campaign books: storm king's thunder
Huh
have you read the Greek (Latin?) mythology story about Narcissus and  Echo? Its so sweet and doomed and everyone dies
Echo doesn't die exactly...
bit of both. The politics channel, much like the activism channel, feels like a channel where dissenting opinions will be shot down harshly, which kinda defeats the point of the channel
although its pretty close
doesnt she kill herself?
I remember it being she wasted away until she was nothing but a voice
all the same
she ded
she dieded
yeah, basically. Ovid just needed to put his twist on it
It's an era of political debate being broken down. Each side is taking such extreme positions that it is hard to tackle nuanced issues. It is what happens when you get political leaders who are not willing to debate in good faith
although as someone who spent some time pining after another, I don't really think of this story as quite as sweet as you do.
But if you think any of those things you brought up are unfairly represented, then what about them do you find to be true?
Because all those things I would look at and go "Yeah, they'd get shot down immediately, because not one of those things has any ground to stand on."
We're not talking the implications of more nuclear power, or how to reform education, or taxes. You're talking about things that have evidence against all of them, and pretty crystalized evidence.
Awww
You also seem to assume that I have not been in that position myself :stuck_out_tongue:
hm, I didn't really mean that, but it does seem to be baked into what I said.
Maybe you were accidentally right, who knows?
And I do think the story is sweet :slightly_smiling_face:
:slightly_smiling_face:
lol now that ive said it, i feel like God is gonna smite me.
Nemesis herself, smiter of the proud
Who said Im proud? I just have bad memory :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi! Did I mention? We went to a restaurant on my birthday that had a dessert  that's basically named after me!
completely coincidental
this made me happy.
weird. was it good? it looks good
Yes. Aysh was delicious.
it was a happy coincidence
nice
nice
nice
nice
Tasty aysh
nice
what did you do?
made a bot that if you say `nice` it threads `nice` 10 times
Does it have to contain the word nice?
```  def nice(self):
    if self.isFromABot():
      return;
    
    if self.text == 'nice' and not self.isPartOfAThread():
      for i in range(0,10):
        self.replyAsRandomUser('nice');```
ok, so that was expected behavior
correct
it has to be exactly `nice`
best part is all those functions already existed so it was super easy to write
Chaos gods will not be satisfied with this! I MUST APPEASE THEM!
why isn't it satisfying?
nice
Chaos gods are satisfied chaos increased
Chaos gods are satisfied chaos increased
I wish there was a way for us to measure the chaos
It would be so satisifying
nice
Ahhhhh so satisfying
Basking in the glow of chaos
nice
nice
how do you define `isFromABot()` ?
:magic:
nice
<@UHQD9J1SL> are you trying to poison me? I'm allergic to pistachios and I'm getting a bit of a sore throat from looking at that picture
the event has a message subtype, if the subtype is 'bot_message' then the message is from a bot
So it stops bots from triggering other bots
there were carolers on Boylston F3.
they're in 222 now
And now they're gone
So does the nice bot only work in channel? Not in threads?
This...is a weird deja vu
but are you ready?
'nice' only in channel.
Yes, I'm always ready
its really easy to set either way in the code
Yeah, just turn off `and not self.isPartOfAThread()`
Or does that horribly break it
I think it's mostly out so it doesn't repeat itself horribly
eh i think it is funnier if it only works in channel
yeah, in thread it would just make things difficult to read
you wouldnt like me
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<@UE2D3HCBW> was one of the carolers in copley
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wouldn't like you because I'm allergic to pistachios? Are you a pistachio?
I am Aysh.
YEAH!
I feel like you're a pistachio
giphy should no longer trigger dejavi
probably
:probably:
isFromABot() will now return true for hidden messages
cuz they kinda are bot messages anyway
possibly
Youre a pistachio!
Uh oh
Full Metal Furies
*Dave spontaneously combusts*
Hmmm, oddly relevant to that game
*Dave spontaneously combusts*
Dave have you ever seen `Full Metal Panic`
?
Does it have to do with Full Metal Furies?
That's all I can think of when you talk about that
Bunta-Kun
LOL!
That's the kind of humor in the game
Also, Meg is the best
today is a shitshow
oohhhhh?
Because of the moving stuff into the apartment?
we have multiple methods of logging, for many different metrics
Or because we made lots of new bots
and none of them can be reconciled
Oh.... it's work
200 requests
200 requests
only two new bots today
Yo
Prometheus is a character in `Full Metal Furies`
In fact, he's the good guy you're all working to bring back
That's a lot for 1 day
I feel like Full Metal is used for a lot of things
`Full Metal Chaos Monkey`
What is this game?
Tabletop? Video?
Seriously. We're lucky to have one a month
I just think Full Metal defaults to either FMA or the type of bullet depending on which group you're hanging out with. Anything else is trying to take Full Metal from two very established things
Though I would play Full Metal Furies
Guess we'd have to play it online? Or would it work local?
Can the dungeon master bot have proper grammar on throws to roll for? "A intelligence throw" is just making me wince.
nice
Woah, this got very robust
That is just a concept
but i'm thinking about hooking that up to a slash command
Fun times
where do you see that?
We'll have bots, and now games!
I'm thinking for anything with a cast time, the user will get a hidden message in channel with options. they will click a button to try to defend from the attack
Something in the screenshot above, drew would get a message. like:
 _hmmmm, it's getting a bit warm_
with a few buttons under it.
nice
nice
wait...
that shouldn't have been possible
oh... CJ's bot can respond to nice in a thread...
fixed
maybe the affects will be tied to number of messages, that way you can't just not talk to avoid statuses. Dunno
should be fixed now
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuh du du duuuuuuuuh du du du du duhhhhhhhhhhhhhh du du duhhhhhhhhhhhhhh duhh duhh
Loud Jesus man is on my train. I thought he only rode the red line. 
Its a Christmas miracle!
Also, taht sound like a Simplsons character
Yeah. Unfortunately he’s not very funny. 
That game is cute and fun
I remember that one. Don’t get the expansion!!
Don't get the expansion? That game base version is not all that much fun to me
The way the expansion works the game doesn’t have to end. Or at least not in a timely fashion. 
Basically once Corbin shuffles in the expansion we played it once and never solved it again. It basically killed the game at WF. 
I just found the base game to be bland in comparison to the expansion. Not saying with expansion it is great, but it was at least an enjoyable time to hang out with friends
Perfect, glad it happened once
For $1.99 it's with it with or without expansion
<@UDC03KCGK> Is being lazy today
<@UDC4QL95G> Time to go to work!
<@UETS9HTSS>
<@UDD45P5A9>
<@UHQD9J1SL>
<@UPGVCMGD9>
jokes on you i'm already at work
I’m still in bed. 
Why are you here already?
Hi
Did you fly out yet or are you still in boston?
Landed in NY
Have fun back home, see you next year!
See you next year!
Good morning good morning!
I LOVE waking up to the dulcet tunes of construction
Also some bad political/ religious discrimination stuff i happening in India and Im lost and confused but also dont want to be sad over something I have no control over
i'm out for rest of the year, gotta make sure everything is done before I go
I’m getting a little of that as well. They are working on the parking garage across the street. 
Ahhhhhhh today's the last day?
Sub-buria wins!
Awwwwww, seems like India is in a lot of civil unrest lately
oh, i love that game with the expansions. How $1.99? GOodwill?
Video, but you've probably figured this out by now
Aysh is kind of in a suburb
ex-urb?
Wait I thought she was in the City
Yessir
yup
Can you get me a copy? I'll give you $3 - that's a FIFTY PERCENT bonus
Wow nobody's going to be around next week
I would, but there was only one :sadpanda:
:sadpotato:
I still need to bring my extra copy of race in though
Das okay. Did you say it has the exapnisions or not?
nah, just the base set
i also didn't verify all the cards were there. It was not unopened like a couple other games I have gotten at that goodwill
ah, okay, that makes a bit more sense
I feel like Drew - I vastly prefer having one or 2 expansions from what I remember
Wait, full metal furies is on gamepass? I guess i got no excuse to not play it then
I think I have gamepass till like 2022 or something stupid like that
she
she's not in Boston proper
haha, did you upgrade xbox live gold? I just did the $2 for 5 months thing
Are we talking one of the major areas immediately outside of boston cause that's still not suburbia
yeah, I upgraded existing gold using the $2 for 5 months. The cool part is that it converted all my existing gold to the gamepass, so I bought an extra year before doing the upgrade to save some money
so I got my remaining balance, +1 year, +5 months
Yea, I would have done that, but I didn't have gold and really didn't want to pay for it haha
I'm enjoying my $2 for 5 months :smile:
Paid $2, have it till the end of april
Then I'll probably just never subscribe again
But `Full Metal Furies`. I'd completely recommend playing couch coop if you get the chance. And DON'T look up any of the puzzles online. You can figure them all out yourself
Living Room computers are the best, everyone should get one :smile:
I gave away my spare frenkenputer
noooooo
Living room computer + steam controller is legit
Especially with game pass
Maybe, but i like having multiple monitors while gaming. Being limited to just the tv would be sad
While gaming? I love having 2 monitors, but only play on one screen. And it makes MP a lot easier haha. I don't think I've played many/any SP games on my living room PC
Though it IS nice to be on the couch instead of a chair
yeah i only play on one screen as well, but I like having the ability to alt tab to another monitor if I want to look something up. If I am playing split screen TV all the way, but i don't do much of that these days
Yea, that's true, but I don't usually look things up in SP games (too much)
And then I yell at brian to look it up for me :smile:
also, apparently i picked up the #46 game on BGG a while back and didn't realize how well rated it was:
<https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124742/android-netrunner>
I really want to get the ability to wireless cast my computer to the tv downstairs
And then I yell at brian to look it up for me :smile:
I feel like BBG over indexes on Deckbuilders\
I have wanted to play netrunner for a while now
well I have a copy now
turns out it's an 80 dollar game I picked up for 1.99
how the fuck did you do that?
That's a LGC tho, right?
So you got the base set
I've thought of picking it up, but I'm not really sure if I'd ever play a LCG
(even tho it's over now)
:wtf: is LCG?
goodwill bruh
legacy card game?
Living Card Game. It's like a TCG, except you buy the whole expansion set instead of individual boosters
Living*
Glad I'm not the only one questioning it
Living card game
ah what's a living card game?
<https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/more/living-card-games/>
Clearly I'm not deep on the card game terminology
It's a more ethical way to do a TCG. Still stupid expensive tho
Alright what's a TCG?
cause CCG is the only thing I'm familiar with
This has to be my favorite randomly generated sentence `Roll an locksmithcheck with advantage to jump over the falling rocks`

another way you can prevent python formatting issues is to have a string like so:

`'Roll {} {} the {}'.format(a,b,c)'`
so you don't have to worry about dealing with string concatination
Ohhhh yea... that's the way I see almost all python strings
I didn't know the syntax for interpolation in python, didn't feel like looking it up

I was watching Star Wars
And.....?
is it the mediocre movie that critics call it?
And.....?
is it the mediocre movie that critics call it?
Would play Full Metal Furies with you couch co-op
:true_dumbledore:
Critically, not good. I however quite enjoyed it while recognizing its flaws. It's a fun blockbuster
so lots of sizzle no steak?
Yeah, you could say that. I enjoyed it, had fun with it and will go back to see it again. Without any spoilers though, I can't say much more. Whether or not you'll enjoy it is something I have a guess on but by no means certainty.
Hey guys, I found a way to get free shipping to alaska (in dev at least)
Uh oh.....
nice
nice
NOT nice
I kinda wish there was a way to randomly call the bot for shits and giggles
Only 1 in 10 chance for that to trigger
awk
i was messing with it and made it 1/100
Boom Dakota made it even harder
nice
Apparently this meme is supposed to be a game of karma roulette. Like one of the "nice" comments gets downvoted to hell
Yea those things happen
is it a variable number of 'nice's now?
Yes
is it a variable number of 'nice's now?
Min of 3 max of 10
what if one person the bot imitates gets a ping to go look at the thread in 24 hours?
<@UDC4QL95G>
:bug:
There may or may not be a new bot
Okay, I'll believe that there is not a new bot
I have a 50/50 chance of being right given your sentence
is that a new bot or an old one? I don't know all the old ones
<@UDC4QL95G> that looks annoying
lol I just thought it was funny
Can it be triggered based on emoji?
yes it can
So if someone reactemojis :mocking-spongebob:
Then it triggers
good idea
alright, bot is no longer automatic
nice try
nice try
It doesn't thread
BOOOOOO
I know
I wondered if it was just a bot problem the first time
if it did, it would throw it on the end of the thread, wherever it was
request complete
Maybe it should post to the channel instead of thread?
Well, thread and post
well I can't insert a message into the middle of a conversation
so I have it set up so it only works once, and only on a main channel message with no replies
There is a chance that if the reaction explosion happens to hit the spongebob mock, it will trigger the bot
not sure though
:shocko:
Do you know which team?
Bitch you might want to stick around, we're gonna be breaking all sorts of shit over here
I'm working on a new team tooooo
starting on the 6th
Most likely Customer Assurance, but it is still up in the air
DAMN YOU BEAT ME TO IT <@UDC4QL95G>
i will likely ride out Q1 with them before transitioning to a more fun team
yeah something is odd with that
OHHHHH I WORK WITH THOSE FOOLS!
So no mocking bots, how.... interesting
well, a team that works on more fun stuff
lol
i'll basically be workign with them till they rework order confirm and ship confirm emails
probably has to do with what we allow Prometheus to interact wiht
Oooh, I was just doing order confirm email stuff
I need them to do more than that
I need to drive down touches
nah this is a whole different logic path
the work they are doing is movign from the old email system to the new, and I don't find that very fun
Yes but I'm in the process of saying they need to be doing more to make our customers happy
Like, sending more messages for the love of god!
:awk:
oof i think my asynchrnous posting broke prometheus
more emails?!?!?!
wait
SO MANY MORE EMAILS!
dakota, aren't you supposed to be working on work things?
How do you have asynch posting?
AND TEXTS!
please no
He's probably done
Or it's boring and he doesn't want to do it
nice
That's not how work works
That's not how your work works
I am doing code reviews and documentation
it was dying earlier, i think it is still catching up to teh failed events
:luffy_vomit:
I also will be on a new team when I return so my Q4 stuff is done
:lol: hover over the emoji
i see
that's kinda funny
Yea.... I feel like that would be with disadvantage
I CAN THROW A SHOPPING MALL?!!?!?
only if you pass the archaeology check
fyi, list of skills is from Call of Cthulhu
Interesting
more can be added. all constants in constants files
it's friday and I am ready to go home
I have been ready to go home from the moment I got to work
love this bot
Tho I saw star wars last night. So that was nice
it was dave's Idea
yup
It was Dakota's Idea
<@UDDE5960N>
I blame <@UDC03KCGK>
no
lol
Opinions?
How spoiler do you want it to be on a scale of
none
-  to -
jar jar binks was behind it all
none, just general opinion and thoughts
If you're a star wars fan, you'll really like the movie. Like, a lot (more than likely).

Without going into spoilers or anything, I can say that as a movie (in terms of story, pacing, etc.), it's :meh:. But as a STAR WARS movie, it's :excited:
And I came to this conclusion by myself as I was walking out, hadn't read anything about it other than that critical reviews were mixed
See I'm expecting it to be the other way
because the story has plot holes so big you could drive the death star through them and Abrams is trying to rectify that in one sitting
Without getting into spoilers, he pretty much just ignores all of TLJ
Which, to my mind, is fine
I liked that movie, but it was a very different tone
This is a very STAR WARS movie
FYI <@UDC03KCGK> has also seen it. He left me less warm and fuzzy
I can see how people wouldn't like it. I can see why the rotten tomatoe's average is ~50%
BUT
It's an exciting star wars movie that gives the fans what they wanted out of TLJ
It would be very difficult to appease fans
That's because they made a trilogy with no purpose
NEW BOT IDEA - you have to type without  the chosen letter of the day of your entire message will be redacted!
ANGRY STARWARS FAN NOISES!!!!
*PEW PEW*
No..... that's not fun
<@UDC4QL95G> I think you're missing a word there
IT WOULD BE AWESOME!
its just an idea generator, not a *good* idea generator
its a good idea :confused: i resent your opinion
lol
you just want to be in your comfort zone and avoid TRUE chaos
oh, did you actually post that? I just assumed it was a bot to spit off ideas. we'd taked about building one yesterday
Well I don't disagree with you there, but I would still like to be able to have conversation rather than just a list of redacted statements
put some elbow grease into it!
what about a bot to convert all of CJ's messages into binary
i dont understand binary though
neither do it
REJECTED
<@UDC4QL95G> NEW BOT IDEA - you have *REDACTED* type without  the chosen letter of the day or your entire message will be redacted!

OPINE!
I'm going to make it super obscure letters for aysh every day.
like gamma
or shin
I wasn't going there to begin with but now that you have me thinking.....
Shin?
Hebrew
<@UDDE5960N> we can make it thorn, or ash. those were even english letters at one point
Nahhhhh I was going with Ulmat letters because I don't even know how to write those
WHAT IS YOU SAYING

 I DODO HEAD
<@UDDE5960N> do you mean umlaut?
I looked it up, Ulmat is a WoW character
For the record, I enjoyed the movie. Reached a pretty similar conclusion to Dave walking out of it. I also really like TLJ
the dots above letters whatever that thing is called
the dots above letters whatever that thing is called
oh, that's nice
It was a lot of fun
yeah, those.
I added a new bot. 
Uh oh
Well, not that time. 
Ummmm
Good Morning Vacation People!
Summon the silent!
summon the silent
hmmmmmmmmm
Redact bot&gt;Summon bot
CLOSE ENOUGh!
/roll 1D20
That feels about right
We did not deceive the acid pit....
I'm doing of the plague right now but still have to go to work
WTF was that sentence?
Can't edit because of redacted bot
I'm assuming you feel like death, but you're going to work
*dying
Got it!
Make sure to cough on management
:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Monday struggle bus
<@UDC4QL95G> will rearranging function calls in server.py allow the summon bot to not be blocked by the redaction bot?
Fuck if I know
We won't see him till like next year
he might as well be dead
WTF was that sentence?
I'm assuming you feel like death, but you're going to work
Got it!
<@UDDE5960N> try it again (I'm not banned, so I can't test it)
Summon the silent
Success!
the order is wonky, but I don't think I'm going to be able to fix that without a lot of effort.
yea..... we should probably put some effort into execution process
Morning
you would want to create a list of message modifications and addons, wait until all funtions are done, then execute all bots at once.
I've done it before for SQL changes.
^ that one works
He's dying cut him some slack
Any bot that deletes a message would likely cause an exception. Rearranging might solve the issue, but it is probably a race condition
yeah, sounds like we need an action queue that flushes after every bot has had a chance
<@UDC4QL95G> IS ALIVE!?!?!?!
ummmmmmmm
there we go
pig latin really?
sorry, had the const too low. fixed now.
I'm sad the @ don't work
LOL!!!!!!
contraction like "i'm" are kind of a corner case I'm not sure what to do with
I don't know how "GUDCQL" happened
Good point, its hard to not use them
Have you seen True Grit? No contractions in the whole movie. Makes it seem really old timey formal. 
No, that's.... amazing
Good movie. 
Cohen brothers remake of John Wayne movie of same name. 
They're pretty good
This is my favorite
Are contractions a new era thing?
I think it’s probably a class thing. 
Like they only became part of “real English” more recently. But I assume some people used them earlier. 
I have to research the subject now. 
lol
You weren't trying to do any work anyway...
<http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/11/origins-english-contractions/>
so its more a phase. Formal writers balked at contractions and eschewed them as a way to make themselves sound more formal. but the contractions themselves existed for a long time before
&gt; Nonetheless, apparently the APA still disapproves of them, according to many commentators, and the United Kingdom’s _The Guardian_ newspaper cautions against overusing many contractions including _can’t, aren’t, don’t, I’m and it’s_ even though “they might make a piece . . . easier to read, they can be an irritant and a distraction, and make a serious article sound frivolous.”
<https://plainlanguage.gov/about/definitions/>
Damn pig Latin
Why didn't I think of that. Good call
don't worry, its only set to CJ
ok, my plan for the first stage of the refactor, I'm going to move the actual post functions to post_util.py

all message manipulation to take place in action and event.

once all the actual posts are centralized then we can then work on the queue.
I changed over replyAsRandomUser() as a proof of concept.
I find it interesting how doug like's playing with the bots, but doesn't want to particpate
I still have to try and read the nonsense they produce.
True
and really at this point I want to make the existing ones work better. My refactor is going well
LOL!
I'm not opposed to it, I just find the distinction super interesting
I really wish you could make directories on glitch, not just files
oh, nevermind, figured out how to do that
Actually true tho
Christmas is big in my half jewish family
what do you do for it? Where does family live?

Ill be sitting at home , maybe go to my apartment gym at best
what about you?
I'm with my immediate family in CT now. For Christmas + day after, my parents hosting 4(ish) aunt/uncle/cousin families and grandmother, then next weekend we're going to another aunt/uncle's house and they're hosing 6(ish) aunt/uncle/cousin families

FOUR FAMILIES! WOW
Well, my mom is one of 9 children
So I have a lot of aunts/uncles
my family does that over the holidays. That's why I don't go home on the holidays.
what do you do for it? Where does family live?
It's "easy" though bc my dad is Jewish, so we don't have to worry about that side of the family coming up for Christmas as well :smile:

I think my dad had  5 siblings - in touch with 2 of them. He also grew up in the same bungalow as his 7 first cousins.
Mom has 2 siblings.


Only one 'family' in its entirety (Including kids) lives in India now.



There are about 5 in California.
That's kinda far away haha
Most of us are on the East Coast and either northeast or mid-atlantic

That's really nice. I was the 7th por 8th generation of my family to have lived in the same city.  I have one cousin who is holding up that candle still.
do you have to buy everyone gifts? that a lot of pressure
I buy all my cousins gifts. I don't have to, but i do
that's cool actually
what does the Jewish side of the family do?
Realtalk: This *REDACTED* thing is kinda annoying
We don't do anything for Christmas. We get together for the jewish holiday, like Passover and Rosh Hashanah
for the Holidays I meant :slightly_smiling_face:
We get together at my Aunt's on Long Island usually

I'm messing with the bots a bit right now. I don't think it would cause a double post, but who knows.
let me go start googling before I ask more
Ive gotten triple posts now
Oh, you'll learn that Hanukkah is kinda an awful holiday

well, basically blame all weirdness today on me. I don't have a good way to insulate dev from prod on this thing.
I will gladly blame weirdness on you any day
today it has the added benefit of being true
```In the narrative of I Maccabees, after Antiochus issued his decrees forbidding Jewish religious practice, a rural Jewish priest from Modiin, Mattathias the Hasmonean, sparked the revolt against the Seleucid Empire by refusing to worship the Greek gods. Mattathias killed a Hellenistic Jew who stepped forward to offer a sacrifice to an idol in Mattathias' place. He and his five sons fled to the wilderness of Judah. After Mattathias' death about one year later in 166 BCE, his son Judas Maccabee led an army of Jewish dissidents to victory over the Seleucid dynasty in guerrilla warfare, which at first was directed against Hellenizing Jews, of whom there were many. The Maccabees destroyed pagan altars in the villages, circumcised boys and forced Jews into outlawry.[15] The term Maccabees as used to describe the Jewish army is taken from the Hebrew word for "hammer```
Like, :holyf:
They took jews who didn't jew as hard as them and circumsized them and forced them to do illegal stuff
They took jews who didn't jew as hard as them and circumsized them and forced them to do illegal stuff
```All five sons of Matthias died violent deaths: Judas and Eleazar died in battle, Jonathan was betrayed and killed by the Seleucid general Tryphon, Simon was killed at a feast in Jericho by his son-in-law Ptolemy and John Gaddi was seized and killed by the sons of Jambri from Medeba.```
:oh:
I mean this is <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>, prod is dev
history be brutal.
Wikipedia definitely didnt highlight that
History is gory

I went out to eat several times this weekend with my 19 year old cousin brother

Every place handed him the check.

People be sexist.
:confused:
<@UHQD9J1SL> wtf is a cousin brother?
The present is too :disappointed:
cousin who is male as opposed to cousin sister that is female
Also yes, we almost always get the check/pay
Ahhhhhh, english has no gender to cousin got it
We like to gloss over both parts
hence I added the extra clarification
And this guy stepped up and was like "bro, I'll sacrifice to this idol for you so you don't get in trouble"

And the _good guy_ was like "WTF YOU SAY M8 IMA KILL YOU"
Although it's amazing how many people feel the past was safer than today.  Dude we don't have armies roving around looting and pillaging!
We're just expected to pick up him as being male
hmm, is that sexist? I suppose so, but more like polite societal norms that are right 95% of the time.
Like, always holding the door open for your gf/wife is sexist I suppose, but also a polite societal gender norm
Depends on the woman, Aysh don't need no man!
Sure, but this is a child. a CHILD.
Hmm. You should take it as a compliment then
They probably thought that you were younger :smile:
:facepalm:
we dont in New England....
True, let me rephrase, large swarths of the world are not at war with itself.  Use to be the whole word
Isn't that a good thing?
Yea, the past was horrible
Probably thought they were out on a date and he was trying to impress her
Ill take it as a good thing :shrug: Gracias, to the waiters
how.... did your message not get redacted
Doug has  removed you from the list....
Bots and me don't get along
so............ youre saying we wouldnt get along. gotchaaaaa
mmmmmm, I don't think I was saying that, but maybe?
I mean it's opt in Aysh, those that want to play do
Those that don't, don't
Some days it feels like the like to argue for the sake of it
Happy day before holiday everyone!!!
Happy day before a holiday to you as well!
Happy Christmas eve!
Respect your elders, CJ
how many revolutions have you performed around the Almighty ball of heat, Drew?
Hey hey hey
Happy 2 days AFTER holiday everyone!!!
Also, happy day before other holiday
Happy 'we might as well not work this week' day!
Hey, yesterday I found a fairly large bug with our test that's hoping to go out on January 2nd
 Yup
So now we're trying to triage it and see if we need to do anything with it
My team was very productive after thanksgiving, but now we’re fighting with the kubernetes team and it’s blocking us almost completely. 
:party:
Is anyone at work today 
No
I'm at work just not at work
Working from my parents' house
Been here since star wars :starwarslightsaber:
<https://emoji.slack-edge.com/TDBEDSEQZ/starwarslightsaber/eaa9425e92ed27b8.gif>
I am!
So diligent 
Too much effort, I told my direct to work from home
i considerd it, but ive been wfh every mornign and coming in late anyway and thoguht itll be nice to turn up for stand up today
Did you actually have stand up?
we will in about an hour
only one perso nis wfh
others are all here
ur team is weird
We have exactly... 0 people in the office?
No one on my team is working today. 
We have most people working today, just all from home
But very spotty for the rest of the week and next
no one on my team seems the super religious nor 'going home for the holidays' kind
I’m neither, mostly wanted a day off. 
My team only has 1 wfh person today and 0 in office people
:wat:
28.23112
that's not precise enough
I respect no man!
I donut get it
I think most of my office is wfh. Maybe 2-5 in office
Bets on when people leave work today?
I told mine no later than 3
No later than 3? How about no later than 11:30...
:got-em:
YOU'RE ALIVE!!!
I am! And finally back to the east coast!
WOOOOOOOO!!!!!
I mean they at least have to pretend to put in a full day
11:30 is close enough
That's straight up half a day
Wooot woot!
Also, as liberal as I am, I do find the whole "Happy Holidays" thing...odd.
/roll 1d20
11+5 for proficiency in driving. So I steal food from the wizard?
I wish
If I get in at 9:30 (big IF), that's 2 hrs
...you get in at 9:30?
Ummm, no
But I'm supposed to
Why roll a d20?
Yea, you should roll a d12
Most :dnd: rolls are with a 20
What? Why a d12?
Dnd and pathfinder at d20. CoC is d100. Fate and PotA are 2d6
BEER and shadow run are xd6
<@UDL020K8D> It was a joke from a few days ago
Oh. I must have missed that when it happened. 

/roll 1d20
Welp I am dead
Deceased
Maybe you get to come back as a mummy or something. 
That would require Brenden and 9 months though
Men will soon be obsolete!
(Im just saying random stuff, I dont believe that). Ish.
Since everyone is on today, what do we all think of moving game night to Wednesday instead of Tuesday?
Would work better for some people and the schedules have changed a bit since then
Jokes on you
I'm ALREADY obsolete
awww
that behavior isn’t right, right? The reaction detection might have gotten mixed up. 
Works for me if it’s the right 2 week cycle. 
I don't know when that bot triggers yet
What is that cycle for reference?
I think it should be the one spongebob react. 
this week would be on that cycle (if not for the holidays)
Brenden had :dnd: Wednesday I thought?
ok, fixed now
You is important, Dave
:ah_hmm:
DID YOU JUST ASSUME MY IMPORTANCE? :triggered:
Pfft. I dictate it. I am the Goddess of Chaos!
Dungeon master shouldnt work in threads since roll doesnt work i nthreads
ok, I'll make that change
Somoene broke the mocking spongebob
no it works fine
just that I cannot be mocked
hm, it worked in testing like 30 minutes ago
Most important work to be doing during a workday on Christmas Eve
<@UHQD9J1SL> Has everyone left work yet?
change made
found it, should be fixed now
:sadpotato:
Is the code openly available somewhere?
I've been here a year now, but I have been since I joined.   but basically they were looking for one and I said I would try . I was also at a start up before so that counted, i think?
also- I know people with ~3 years total lifetime experience (at WF) who have become leads
Not that I'm a better coder than you or anything
Yea, 3 years at WF matters more than priors usually unless you start as a lead I think
go to megamoji_test_channel. link pinned to channel
I added a try catch to the bots so a bug in one won't destroy the others
Ah, makes sense. I'm too tired to look too deep into it rn. And not really knowing .py syntax, though it's pretty easy to follow
Just not really sure what the _ are for
Bad chaos seed
underscore usually means things are private
:ah_hmm:
Because nothing is truly private in python
python sort of looks OO, but isn't really
So... like php?
At least everything isn't ARRAYS like in php
PHP is actual OO. its just bad oo
Pattern I hate most at wf:
`populate()`
It's just so.... awful
my team is on Java Spring Boot now. its wonderful
Mapping db results to objects based on SQL row name
Java is so much nicer. You actually KNOW what ~functions~ methods and fields you can call on each object
Yup
It isssssssssssssssssssssssss almost 3 PM
You can make it!!

Happy only day of the year we use the word “merry” for some reason!
Merry Christmas!
How about "Drink and be merry!"?
Merry Christmas!
I should have said the only one where we use merry to refer to the day itself. 
Merry Christmas and 4th day of Hanukkah!
Well now I will
Merry Christmas and happy holiday!!!!
Merry Wednesday!
But only to you doug
Also Merry birthday
Merry Christmas all! And yes Happy 4th day of Hanukkah (which according to Dave is a terrible holiday, at least in what it is celebrating, but hooray cause presents?)
This begs the question, do you or anyone in your family celebrate Christmas? If not, is there a holiday that is considered the biggest holiday of the year for you?
<https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/hanukkah|https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/hanukkah>
No Christmas but I went to a christian highschool so I have memories of general merriment. We have one every season! They usually involve a lot of food and new clothes and time off from school/ work and....general merriment
Happy general merriment!

what accent is this
mid-atlantic?
I'm not great with accents, but I know that was really popular in movies at the time.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent>

(its a fake accent they made up for movies so both Americans and Brits would watch)
I can't find confirmation on google because all accent conversation is about another character not in the clip. Her strong Brooklyn accent is part of the plot, so that what people talk about
lololol
does anyone know what Shadows of the Past does? <@UDDE5960N> <@UDC4QL95G> <@UDC03KCGK>? I don't know that I've seen this bot before.
is it a first try at deja vu?
Have you seen the whole movie? It's pretty fun. And speech/acent definitely drives the plot,
eh, looks like its not being used. I'm going to get rid of it
I have. I like it, except for the one "Gotta dance" scene, which totally comes out of left field, does nothing for the plot, and lasts way too long.
i think i watched it when i was 5 years old- or maybe i just recollect the title song
<@UDL020K8D> totally agree with you on that
because you lied. we could have had a coalition going
Good morning.

Neat concept, 15% off the top
even if it were 25% off the top, you're still building equity
No I meant for the business, managed right it's a sick gig
Good morning, jew holiday is over, christian holiday is over, is sad times
Lol
Time holiday is almost here
Time holiday is dum tho
I don't enjoy just going out to drink, so it's a  pointless day off for me. Gimme some random holiday in the spring/summer instead.
you don't enjoy staying up just to look at a clock?
That's all I do most days anyway
Lol! You can play games too on time holiday!
you can play games every day
~can~ *should
Is anyone doing work today?
I don't have anything to do other than... peer reviews :gross_blob:
yup, although I working from home
Nope
I'm in a weird spot because my team is re-orging and me and 2 other people are leaving, but the new team/sprint doesn't start till next monday
And we don't have anything to pick up in our current sprint
I am actually doing work, actually surprised by the replies I am getting
I got our unit test suite from 30 seconds to 6 seconds today.
Now 1.5 seconds
Now back to 20 seconds
Did anyone get any fun/cool/unexpected gifts this christmas?
Wingspan
And 2 bracelets for Kate Spade
Oh, I heard that Wingspan is a cool game about birbs.
I don't know anything about bracelets though
You are correct, it's a pretty cute game.
That's fair, I wouldn't expect you to.
I learned about Vsco girls this weekend
And they have bracelets, tho I assume it's not the same
Think more fashion
:fashionable_crocs:
:fashionable_crocs:
What kind of bracelets did you get?
Bangles or chains? 
Two Bangles, very classic.
Kirby Air Ride
Is that what you got?
Nah. Just sayin
It's  a good game

Can't be that bad
I'd rather get a holiday sometime in Spring or Summer when we have none
rather than a few days after christmas and not too far off of thanksgiving
If it makes you feel any better every I've worked is the same. No spring holidays ever
Oh, me too
I'm just sayin
And I hate the holiday too. Cause I don't like going to bars or clubs, and that's the entirety of the holiday for people our age
You can do anything you like. Traditions are dumb. Play video games all night. Take the extra day to travel. Knit. 
I'm with doug
Well yea, but I do that anyway most days haha
I don't need a random day off for that
SURE YOU DO!!!
And I would travel, but I just came back from my parents'
Random days off are the best
You can do NYE elsewhere. It was really cool to see the new year in Kyoto. 
That sounds fun
Haha, I'll just take a quick trip to japan
Yeah, find cheap last minute flights somewhere. 
Whole city came out to eat street food and line up to walk through temples, where there are these giant bells they only ring on New Years. Needs a team of like ten monks to ring. And they ring it 108 times. 
<@UK7V13DS7> I WANNA DO THIS!!!
That sounds amazing honestly
Japanese street food is some of the best food I've ever had
The grilled mochi was so amazing
And the different bread/cakes with red bean paste...
I will agree with this
Also, the big reason I hate New Years is that it reminds me that it's another year and I'm even older
Oh that does sound fantastic :grinning:
And apparently it’s a thing to get an arrow blessed, so on New Year’s Day riding the subway everyone had an arrow sticking out of their bags. 
haha, that's funny
Silence young one
You got life tho
Screw that! It only looks like I'm put together
put together? eh
have a life? ye
Lol
You have a life too board games and smash
Sonewhere. Maybe you can find a carribean flight. 
:blob-doubt:
bad prometheus
lol
it's all about what plane isn't full
Blahblahblahblahblah
LIES SIR!!!!
Isn't that bot not supposed to ping if you're already in the thread?
You could always join us aysh
Good point, Doug must have missed that in the implementation
Didn’t miss it. Didn’t feel like writing it last night. 
Plan to fix it eventually. 
Honestly didn’t think people would notice. 
lol
join?
Better than Aysh beating us. 
I donut understand
Join in what?
the conversation
I can join anything if I set my mind to it
my slack app is Missing some messages and I have no idea what you're talking about though
Boooooo
Start throwing out some opinions at random, just hope they line up with the conversation. 
Happy new year!
Or house parties. Or awkwardly staying home went playing games with family
Honestly, yeah man, it's a life. When you stop having time for board games or video games, or even books, even though you have "a life" you don't stop wanting to go back to when you had more time for those things. It's a life, just a different one.
This happens on Android. I sign out of the workspace and then sign back in and usually that fixes the discrepancies
Happy New Year. Been at work for 18 of the last 24 hours, so I'm just going to sleep and watch when Harry Met Sally (our new years day tradition) with Sam
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
ok Dave, I think the thread caller thing should filter users out now.
Buenos días shitheads!
Look at you all spicy!
Good Morning!
Still need to see that movie
Happy new year everyone :)
:smh:
What movie?
uhhhhhghggggggg
Being back in the office sucsk
CJ starting off 2020 on a good foot
I mean.... Yesterday was awesome
sooooo I did
I just changed it to monday
I'm lazy
what did you do yesterday
Super lazy
Mei had some friends come over and we played Unstable unicorns and Catan
What did you do Aysh?
I was in Pittsburgh, we went to a *rolls eyes* Gatsby theme party
ohhhhh the new year's eve party I went to was roaring 20s
did you dress up in theme?
Fuck no
REALLY THAT'S THE WORD TODAY1?!!?!?
/roll d20
Fuck yea I notices those blood sucking bastards
I looked normal and my cousin came in a dragon onesie
But everyone dressed up fancy, except the guy who went paper boy
paper boy sounds cute
I made fun of him because everyone else was wearing black and I was also wearing black
I wore jeans and thats as fancy as Im ever gonna get
WHAT?!?!!?
No sexy dresses?
CONSTANT VIGILANCE!
lo0l
I chose not to believe you because this doesn't sit with my world view of you
pants and sneakers are the only appropriate things to wear to dance club places
The party I went to had a fair number of people dressed up. Mostly gatsby-esque, although a couple people dressed like dock workers, and were throwing dollar bills in a circle and shooting dice. It was a nice twist.
Mei told me I should have gone as one of the homeless from the great depression
"Please sir, may I have some more"
A lot of meme's about how 20s generally bring about a great plague too
Well- Measles.
Actually Spanish flu swept the worlds in 1920, massive population kill off
anti vaccination means we probably will have another plague this decade though
That would be not fun.....
Must... resist urge.... to say something.... self-deprecating...
:crickets:
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME AYSH!??!?!
WHERE ARE YOU DAKOTA?!?!?!
I am  a snowman
:snowman:
is it end of day yet
Unfortunately not
I also wish the day was over
I wanna take a nap
I made delicious shrimp this weekend and now I want to make more
video is a tame version, image is the Aysh version (the red is from chilli powder)
looks good
nice
Young Guns
Bad prometheus, this is a silly thread to ping us on
Can you use a machine learning genetic markov algorithm to determine thread "worthiness" before pinging us?
No
:he-knows-you-tried-but-asks-you-to-try-better:
You're welcome to dave
OM NOM NOM!
Good Morning Monkeys!
Summon the silent
Good morning fellow monkeys
I just want to say, we are on the same wavelength today
I typed fellow monkeys while my screen hadn't scrolled down to the new messages yet
Who's bday?
that was a bot
specifically the :dejavu: bot
What does that bot do?
impersonates one of us and says a random message from the channel history
For a random message it pots a random statement from the channel history as a random person
It's super duper randome
it has a chance to fire upon every message sent
Pretty sure it's only messages in the main chat, not in threads
Who's excited for WW3?
Ugh. 
1/100 chance. I forget if it works on threads. Can check when I get into the office. 

With the way the code is set up, it should be easier to make public those kinds of conditions. 
Who wants that?!?!!
Since that bot had <@UETS9HTSS>  name but slightly altered. Do I have a bot and what is it's name/what can I name it?
No and yes
Technically Brenden went in and made them all off color names, but the code is all available in <#CDU145F08|megamoji_test_channel>
It’s in buttery-waxflower (link pinned to channel CJ mentioned.) All in python now. There is a people constants file. Note, things are linked currently. I believe opting into dejaVu also makes you fair game for the censorship bot. 
(Possibly)
Pretty much opens you up to the full suite of mayhem and chaos we've unleashed here
I take that as Doug knows what I'm talking about and is also not happy about our dipshit president
Yeah. 
It’s a bit weird what you have to opt into and what you don’t. 
I only re-wrote existing functionality, I haven’t gone through to make things consistent yet. 
I like the uptick in draft age searches
I mean.... if this really does escalate, and depending on how many people get involved a draft is a real issue
Or this could be like another Iraq where we walk in kick down the door, and just have a slowly burning rebellion to deal with
depends what kind of escalation you're talking about.
an invasion of Iran (close to worst-case)? Not a kick-in-door operation at all.
Ehhhhh, do you think the Iranian military is all that much better than the Iraqi?
yes, by a long shot.
its resting on a far more stable national base as well.
much bigger economy
better integrated into surrounding politics.
more aggressive.
Boooooooo, this is not gonna be pretty
well, it shouldn't be that bad. The WW3 and invasion stuff seems overblown to me. there are a lot of smaller ways for this to go badly.
<@UPGVCMGD9> got your ID
Ehhhhhh
I could see this turning into a full blown shooting war
I mean our strategetic advantage has always been distance
but a couple of terror attacks, maybe something the scale of 9/11 and there would be a full invasion
anyone into skiing?
<https://brstransportation.com/ski-trips/>
I don't know what any of this means, I kinda want to learn. I know Mei only likes cross country
I'm specifically referring to downhill
I'm not into cross country
looks like round-trip bus + lift ticket is around $69 per person for most of these trips
I mostly have no idea what is going on/don't know my options/doesn't read most of the channels
then you probably don't want to opt into the chaos
but up to you
you'll get a lot more notifications if you opt in
In theory you should be able to opt in/out via slack commands. we just haven't set it up yet.
I only like cross country skiing 
I could drive so we wouldn't need to worry about a bus or anything
I have at least 1 seat that folds down, so I could fit 4 plus skiis. It'd be a fairly tight fit, but :shrug2:
Good morning :sun_with_face:
Yea both Dave and I have cars, so driving out is always an option
And means I don't have to get up at 4am
&gt; ...have also suggested this could make things "tougher for Democratic Party electoral candidates to argue against a stronger defense budget in 2020, which would remove a defense sentiment overhang".
Regardless of what happens, the military industrial complex wins and the american public loses.


whooo
for the record, I don't think this will lead to WW3. (imo) it's just going to be stupid escalation of threat and probably an increase in terrorist activities, probably leading to our withdrawal from the region and horrible instability and a nuclear Iran
I mean terrorist activities is what lead to war with Afghan and Iraq sooooo......
As to withdrawal, I've always been of the opinion we shouldn't act like the worlds cop.
Yea, if we're driving 2AM is great to get up
Pax Americana is a legit thing though. Us acting as the world's cop has put us into such an advantaged position and increased economic and social forces around the world. That said, the EXTENT to which we act as the cop and the means to how we do it is debatable
Pax Americana has always been the goal, Manifest Destiny and all that.  Our advantage was being the only first world nation with industry intact 80 years ago. I would also argue that while we pull back on bases, we should continue to drive improvements in our Carrier fleets.  Our ability to project capability anywhere in the world is what keeps us safe.
pax americana isn't only about us though, it's the global understanding that America is, effectively, the world police and not to do bad things or America (hopefully along with a coalition of friends) will come down on you. Force projection via aircraft carriers is obviously a huge part of that, but not all
We have to be willing to do things and have the soft power that the current president is squandering
We haven't had soft power for a while now
We have - we've had good relationships with other countries (more or less) although that was greatly damaged by Bush and Iraq
Other than the spying crap, we've were getting into a pretty good position with Obama, with examples such as the Iran Deal and being so close to the TPP
And we still have the institutions such as the United Nations, NATO, Hollywood (yea), global business/brand recognition, and other culture
I did not like the TPP
you didn't like the spin that certain people put on the TPP*
I didn't like the Mega corps that TPP could create
Free trade is cool and all, but they still need to abide by SOMEONE'S law
because of IP protections?
Or because of free trade?
Good morning. I don’t want to go back to work next week
IP protections/Ability to sue countries to lower their standards
The coffee at copley is burning my eyes
woah. that's not... normal for coffee
I feel like you shouldn't pour hot coffee in your eyes
doesn't sound healthy
ah- thats what ive been doing wrong@
So no breathing in the fumes either?
did you put pepper spray in the coffee?
I prefer chili powder
Clearly needs more capsaicin, as that will stop the crying
"*I'm a Little Teapot*" is an American song describing the heating and pouring of a teapot or a whistling tea kettle. The song was originally written by George Harold Sanders and Clarence Z. Kelley and published in 1939.[1] By 1941, a _Newsweek_ article referred to the song as "the next inane novelty song to sweep the country".[2]
lol
"I'm a little teapot short and stout"
Where did that come from Aysh?
Are we getting random Wikipedia summaries?
I got $2 from singing that song once
Well, actually only $1. But my other friend still owes me $1
My current mental state, as I devour gingerbread men , wrapped in a blanket
WTF
Oh no I feel fine! Im sitting at work :smile:
Are you WFH? or sick?
Well, actually less than $1. Cause it was one canadian dollar
Alright now I'm really lost as to what Aysh is doing
She's feeling bad for me for my lost dollar 15 years ago
:musical_note: She's a maneater :musical_note:
Aysh is singing this in her head while at work
do you all not have work blankets?
watchout boy she'll .............. chew you up?

I forget
sounds right.
OMG NO there is no thread!

A thread cannot be found.

404 thread missing
:homer-hide:
Dave, Ill give you 2 American dollars if you sing that for us again
I use to have a classmate who would sing that song whenever I asked him in high school hehehe he does the teapot dance too :) 
I'll do it for $2 USD!
I might actually combust if I put on a blanket at work
I'm with brenden I'm already warm enough as it is
ohhhh boy
what is dave doing for $2?
singing "I'm a little teapot"
AND DANCING I WANT THE DANCE
the dancing is mandatory
That is the correct line Aysh
He did it for free ;p
oh, of course
oh, you'll do it for free?
even better
The dancing part is the best hehehe
The dance is part of the song
You have to learn Meionese, she's not referring to dave, she referring to her school friend
I think Brendan knows but he is messing with Dave 
It’s Meilish*
Meilish
Nope, Meionese
:meilish: should be an emoji
Meilish is not nearly as funny
It's generally the language of a small angry asian
Meionese :smile:
It's Meionese in English, but native Meionese speakers call it Meilish
Like how French is "French" in English, but "Fraicais" in French
OHHHH MAN THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY!!!!
similar to how potato is spoken in the northeast, but it's pronounced potato in other regions
DAVE YOU'RE THE :bomb:
that sad part is I did this when vocalizing it in my head
I think it would be amusing to add functionality to :dejavu: to index nouns in the channel history, and select a message with a similar noun if possible
That sounds.... difficult
it might make it more :hal9000:
And less :hal_8000:
Meilish
I had a work blanket and a desk space heater
:fire:
space heaters arent allowed in copley- we checked
thank god they're not allowed
They're never allowed, it doesn't stop people from bringing in heat fans
Is that a new policy? Because every woman on my old team had one
I might actually murder my neighbor if they turned on a space heater at the desk next to me
No, it's just not enforced policy
same way it is not enforced policy to not bring loaded guns into work?
I was always too cold in that office but I was also directly under one of the vents
I've found most offices too cold for me though
vents can be covered, sweatshirts can be donned, gloves can be worn, blankets can be had
I'm not allowed to take off more clothing
I am old man because I can not be drafted
apparently you're not in the normal draft past 25
TIL
26
26 = past 25
I guess this are synonymous
But what if you have all those and are still cold?
ah, so I am 26?
By that logic, yes
Also they make it pretty socially unacceptable in some offices to wear so many layers of clothing indoors
and fingers. you cant type with gloves on
I've seen fingertip less gloves in the office
I mean.... for now
It's scary news for sure
Try heated blankets it’s the best!!
Good morning!
Summon the silent (does this work?)
Summon the silent
The sun is up; Marissa is up :tired_face:
Wait.. The sun isn't even up
Good pre- morning, better?
Wow! It's Sunday. This is impressive
We were going to go snowmobiling, but our driver crashed off the highway
So now I'm in a McDonald's in Lincoln NH
Probably going to walk to a brewery in a bit
Jesus that's really early Marissa!
Been at 2 breweries today. Allaghash and Definitive
I'm not familiar with definitive
Allagash is quite nice though
They are across the street. Have some really good stouts and sours. Started in 2018
nice
nice
You're alive!
Yessir. finally back on slack
Also up kinda early
Good morning!
Summon the silent
lots to catch up on
morning :wave:
Heated blankies are no bueno mei
At work or in here?
I just moved next to a window recently which has been a bit chilly, but not to the point of needing a blanket
at work. Not sure I want to try to catch up in here :lol:
anything worth going back for?
No
Other than the fact that Doug refactored everything
oh damn. much more organized now.
Yea..... with this level of abstraction I have trouble following what it does
It takes the original event and passes it to every bot. 
Each bot may post/delete/ reply as they wish. 
But no one modifies the original event itself. So you don’t get the issue you had before where redacted killed SoS
And you shouldn’t have to know the details of how to post. Just trust the utilities. 
Have you guys played Kitchen Rush?
I mean you say that like we have documentation for how to interact with this stuff
It's a board game version of too many cooks
a friend got it for me for Holiday and I recommend
Sounds neat, have to look into it
That’s largely on python. A real OO with interfaces would make things easier to interact with. 
oh, looks like _Damage Report_ but based off Covercooked instead of Star Trek. sweet.
I was going more off the fact we just kinda make up stuff as we go
I think a Too Many Cooks game would be playing Mafia and Overcooked simultaneously while watching Everybody loves Raymond and Full House on split screen.
Oh, maybe I'm thinking of overcooked. I don't remember what the game was I played at Dave's apartment
Overcooked was the game
That's such a good party game, I'm sad I haven't played it since
<@UDC03KCGK> was talking about having a video game night over at <@UDL020K8D>’s place at some point
we should
Overcooked then
Or at <@UDBGH9BMX>'s house so I don't have to travel as far!
I made a new command. "/bot_list". you should be able to use it in this channel to see the bots we current have running here. It will only be visible to you, so don't worry about spamming the channel.
Bot Request: make the command /bot and list be a second param
i.e. `/bot list`
that way we can add other bot commands if we need
Not sure CJ would be able to do your place
:oh:
ok, going to do that. command probably won't work for a minute or two.
ok, per Dakota's suggestion, command is now `/bot list`
should be working now
ayyyy worked for me
some exist without being shown there. If they return an empt string it will not show up here. so private bots or WIP won't have to show up
Yeah, plus everyone traveling to your place so you don't have to travel is pretty inefficient. It's why I don't end up hosting many game nights during the week even though I'm always willing to.
Stabby
WAIT WE CAN MAKE STUFF VISIBLE TO ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE!?!?!?
only one person at a time
kinda like how giphy works
Yea, but if I loop through a list, that means I can choose who sees stuff
true
not sure I ever made a send hidden message function though.
but how is `/bot`  working then?
App commands by default only post to the user. You can also have command post to the channel, I just didn’t set it up for this command. 
Booooooooo
I don’t know if you can send a hidden message to other people. 
/roll 1d20 +3
Eh, not great. 
wait, you added it to a new glitch server?
Yeah, I moved it over since flame mine was too full to upgrade. 
And python 2 was deprecated on Jan 1. 
oh gotcha.
The emote stuff is still on megamoji. 

But everything else will be butter wax flower. 

I haven’t hooked up the other slash commands yet. 
yea, unfortunately true
lol megamoji has needed to die for a long time
true that
If you want to port stuff over to newPrometheous, it should be easier now
we should be able to connect flask to cron as well, so you don't have to run the emote script from your personal machine
(I don't really know what that script does)
wont work since hubot needs to be pinged from wayfair's network
oh, nevermind
I can decouple the syncing of emojis, but there's not much point
I don't really know what megamoji functions actually do. I didn't feel like trying to parse them
I copied over the thread here part, but just that
I have no motivation today
I got a new team so I'm just talking with them
Ohhhh fancy
How's the new team? What do they work on? What happened to our rewards program?
Said the spongebob reaction was not used while I was gone
I didn't know it existed until now
it was broken whenver I tried to use it
I tried it a bunch of times
and it's now broken again
really?
it only works if there is no other messages
1. Working on the Wayfair Credit Card. Seems nice and I moved with 2 other people from my old team
2. I wasn't on the Rewards Program, was on the Loyalty Program. It's not that we're getting rid of it, but we had too many engineers on and were going far faster than business could keep up with so we moved a couple of people over
oh, interesting. That shouldn't be the case.
nvm, I see it:
```if message.get('replies')
  return```
<@UDC4QL95G> I see the mock happened three times without the emote.
He removed it
the emote was removed
ah, nvm
I was thinking about making it so when the emote was removed, the text would be too, but i never got around to it and it is more stable as a one-and-done sorta deal
uhh
I figured <@UETS9HTSS> would try to break it like he did wayfair workflows
the 10th reply?
that is a bit trippy not sure how that happened
unless the logic was flubbed in teh refactor
it happened correctly earlier today
Dead here at Time Out so I feel ya
I just left it when I discovered it didn't behave as I assumed
To be fair, I wasn't trying to break the workflow when I did so
To be fair, I wasn't trying to break the workflow when I did so
Thats good! Glad it seems to be working out for you!
Also didn't the whole business side of your house turn over?
eh?
I don't know about that, I don't think so?
lol
Don't work a lot with the business side?
I work with my STO business side, but not higher up that much?
Haven't heard of significant turnover though
Ohhhhhh one of the teams we worked with a year ago has no one still there it was kinda suprising
on Loyalty, or storefront in general?
Thought it was loyalty, could have been services too
There is another "loyalty" team that's completely unrelated to us (they came first), so it might ahve been them
But there are a lot of sf teams
that's such gibberish
yes
Oh well
what were you doing with us/them? That'll give me an idea if it was me or not
The only person from here that I remember workign with/needing help from was <@UDL020K8D>
Oh we were discussing how large parcel could play with loyalty
Of course not, i'm on the business side. I barely interact with my own engineer's nevermind someone elses
hmm, could be us then, but not sure what that have to do with MyWay
Because Myway discounts Assemblies both Handy and Wayfair to get people to sign up
ahhhhh, yes
man, I would have been so excited to see a :cj: face on one of my tickets...
Hahahahahaha
I get excited when I see you in one of the channels a frequent with an issue
I get excited when I see you guys in the slack channels I frequent
&lt;rant&gt;
&lt;end rant&gt;
My phone won't charge/died
I use my phone as 2nd factor authentication on paypal
What kind is it?
Ewwwwwww
I want to buy a new phone on swappa
swappa only uses paypal as a payment method
go back to thread post 2
asl;dkfjlkas;dfjkasdjfkasldfkjlasdfjaskdjfl;asjkdl;fjkasdjf
&lt;/rant&gt;
Oooh, my phone was good at dying
I literally had 34 minutes of screen on time - it'd die while I was still on the red line
well that is some epic fail
That's the only down side to 2 factor auth is if one of them breaks
well I should have my email or something as an option
but it's not
I literally had 34 minutes of screen on time - it'd die while I was still on the red line
Can't you change 2FA online?
yes, if I log into my paypal account
Usually it gives me the option of email or phone (not sure about paypal tho)
go back to thread post 2
If I have both set up*
my options are authenticator app or text to phone
Basically Brenden got himself locked out because his phone is dead
solution, ~steal~ borrow someone else's phone and switch out the sim chip
BAM PROBLEM SOLVED!
actually not a bad idea
does that actually work that way?
Depends on the type of phone but yes
Only problem is you won't have your apps on the new phone
dont need apps
just text messaging
then yes, assuming you can remove your sim card, my new phone removes that ability
Makes it easy to steal them
yeah, I can remove mine
someone definitely increased the probability of that emoji react
/roll d20 -2
Ouch, giant lizard is long gone
Uhhhhh it was only suppose to be on me
failure
So..... it's new that it tortures everyone
I'm going to turn down the emote spam. That happened more than I wanted
wait, was there an emote spammer on CJ? I built a new one that does it on anything, didn't know one already existed
Ohhhhh..... <@UDC4QL95G> made it
it must be on Megamoji
This was I think one of the first real bots we made
<@UETS9HTSS> not to derail your thread. That 2FA stuff raelly sucks when it turns against you
very true
Anyway phone numbers are tied to the sim card, not the phone. So you should be able to get text messages to auth you are you
ok, CJ, found the original CJ spam bot, turned it off. only 1 spam bot now.
lol
I also found something called Dave's Bane in the code. it just pings Dave a lot? I'm not going to touch that one.
O LAY O LAY O LAY!
Technically it just @ dave very very rarely but completely randomly
This was from the @ wars before the rest of you joined
took my sim card out, but now I need a phone
I knew there was good reason I wasn't in this channel for a long while
I think those might have taken place in <#CDBT6UTCL|game-night-schemes> even before <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> was formed
which will be a minor challenge
Possibly major depending on the phones people around you have
Those were dark times
I think you mean great times
Dice bot can do so many neat things
Is Dave's Bane still active? On like some ridiculously reduced rate?
yes and yes
Good, very good
It wasn't the best when I was getting pinged while talking to my manager by "Dave's Bane"
Was it pinging you a lot? The thing was at 1/200 previously
its currently set to ping once every million non bot messages
As in 1/1000000 probability? Or it's a counter?
probability
Well, if we ever see it again, it's literally a "1 in a million"
I think 1/10,000 would have been sufficient.
Iirc it was a lot when it was first made. But that was long ago
Iirc it was a lot when it was first made. But that was long ago
Do people in here enjoy watching The Office?
Never had watched it before and was curious on people's thoughts
Really? Wow, it was really ubiquitous at one point. 
I really liked it, although I have not watched all the post Michael Scott seasons 
Good morning!
<@UDDE5960N> how's the commuter rail life?
<@UHQD9J1SL> what chaos do you have in store today?
<@UDC4QL95G> he's back!

Why is dave in there 3 times?!?!!?!
You know it took me a while before I realized what happened
Good morning!
<@UDDE5960N>  How goes the commuter rail life?
<@UHQD9J1SL> what chaos do you have planned for today?
<@UDC4QL95G> finally back, but oh so far behind
<@UDTR9SLN4> attempting to get us to all play her kitchen simulator
<@UPGVCMGD9> able to text for the next 45 minutes
<@UETS9HTSS> a very generous host...of game nights
Doug, plays around with the bots he'll not let get unleashed on himself
Dave Freeman, Dave Freeman, Dave Freeman (wasn't going to ping him 6 times in a row)
<@UDD45P5A9>  Unfortunately not in Hawaii right now
<@UK7V13DS7> might be anywhere in the world, no one knows. 
<@UE2D3HCBW>  *Will? Will! Wiiiiiiiiiilllllllllllll!* -click
<@UJTEHPEPL>  How is NYC going?
<@UEA7LHFQS> not active in this slack, but maybe he would be if he were in this channel.
I watched it for a law class lol
That's basically what I wrote the first time
Hello! Yesterday I accidentally inhaled chocolate from eating too fast . I am an unstoppable Force of nature!
Pretty sure this is still your favorite bot
Does it still have a probability increaser for longer messages?
No, literally just random probs
I feel like that makes you very stoppable. Chocolate was able to take you out
I mean we could do funny math with character length if you want
I mean, it's already at a rare prob and finding ways to strike at the perfect time. Doesn't need help
I'm going with inhaling the chocolate didn't stop her which is why she's an *UNSTOPPABLE FORCE OF NATURE*
I do love the smell of chocolate. There was a town in Holland that smelled of chocolate
I heard the same about Hershey pa.  Drove through it once
Accurate
We need to fix Chaos seed to recognize people are in threads
Commuter rail was fine today by the way.  Thanks for asking!
Chaos cannot be planned. Chaos must come from within.
on never she minutes
Brenden, i feel like you're having a stroke.  You might want to get that checked out
or am I?
I warned you, my good deed for the day is done
kitchen the busily in this other rail
<@UETS9HTSS> not but his phone is having a stroke and flatlined
`Doug, NYC?`
What? 
oh btw, chaos seed can now trigger on old threads due to the new implementation. We will likely be seeing it a lot more often
before the list of messages eligible for chaos seed was held in memory, and was therefore cleared each time the server slept
now it is in a text doc
Oh, he got scrambled. 
I was assuming people didn’t really go back to threads not in the current latest 100 very often. 
I suspect the new way will feel a lot like the old way. 
Oh wait, reread your thing. 
I though it held the las thundered. I didn’t think about the server refresh. 
That was the intention, however we discovered that the server lost track of threads relitively quickly. I could also just be noticing chaos seed more often now
Yea we haven't being doing our crazy thread stuff any time recently
Well, if people necro, all the more reason to notify people 
Brenden really liked the fact because it can be hard to follow when we're active in 2 threads at the same time
excuse me!
my phone starved to death
there was no stroke involved
FYI I have no phone at the moment
:panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2:
I ordered a pixel 4 xl from some dude in chicago via swappa
Oh wait, reread your thing.

yea it's great.  It totally looks normal too!
yeah, swapped with my roommate's iphone
made the purchase
and swapped back
FYI I have no phone at the moment
Glad it was a success
also I appreciate the use of :panic2: as I uploaded it
So the SIM card swap worked?
Starving to death sounds like a negligent parent :sideeye:
well when your child's mouth stops working, there's not much you can do
Poor poor phone just wanted a good family
I mean..... I will be cautious with my baby around him now
yea it's great.  It totally looks normal too!
ran my aliasing script again
What does your script do?
takes in json input, and aliases emojis that don't already have the alias in a certain format
so `he-brings-you-` &gt; `hby-`
`she-brings-you-` &gt; `sby-`
`this-is-not-` &gt; `tin-`
I should probably have the script hit the api to fetch the json instead of me doing it
but that's the next iteration
The first four seasons are excellent, but the last 5 kinda drag. It was a cultural touchstone for a while, but I think at this point if you haven't watched it, you missed the boat and you can just get on the next one
Can you alias `this-is-not` to `Sn`?
I could
:but_why:
:tin:
``tin`1
(get it?)
ahh, I see what you're saying
I feel like that would be lost on most people
It is!
oh yea, it was just a joke. Generally if I say "can we/you", I'm joking :upside_down_blob:
Well I don't need to be on the boat, just was curious people's opinions. So far, I haven't liked it at all. Michael Scott is just uncomfortably racist and sexist, which just makes for a lot of uncomfortable awkward moments. 
Also was curious on your opinions because Sam commented "it hits a little too close to home if you have worked in an office before and hated it."
I really disliked it
and I hate how people make it a major part of their self-image
Stupid bot. 
Anyway, it I'm not watching it to be on any boat, just that people said it was good. 
Unfortunately not really liking it after the first season. Michael's just a racist and sexist and that humor didn't really age well (just a lot of uncomfortable pauses for comedy). 
Sam also commented last night "it hits a little too close to home if you've ever worked in an office and hated the experience."
Don't feel bad Drew, I've only caught an episode here and there.  Also there's an american version and a british version.  Supposedly the british is darker
60% of dating profiles have too many references to the office
or at least, that was the case a year ago
I thought that's the purpose, is that it's suppose to hit home. Like the dilbert comics
i thought you were going for 'isn't'
Ohhhhh `this is not` = `TIN` = elemental tin = `SN` on periodic table
:clever:
Dilbert I can find funny, this feels like reliving the characters uncomfortableness. Maybe lots of people in offices enjoy it for that
I vehemently dislike video scenes that are uncomfortable
Hence my distaste of the office
It's a style of humor that has almost been entirely shamed out of the stand up comic scene, but was popular around the time the Office was big
I would probably argue the medium has an impact on your perception, but they're both going for the same thing.  The Office has more "uncomfortable" humor, but both are picking fun at how insane working in an office is
But awkward humor just doesn't do it for me. Dilbert has a punch line
For example, I loved Office Space. Though was not an adult when I watched which I feel like it's coloring the perspective
I kinda want to rewatch office space now
You should try the british version of it, I hear it's suppose to be less cringey
Much more "dark humor" which I think would be more punchline oriented
I didn't like the British version. Michael Scott is dumb but well meaning. The British character is actively mean.
Good luck with that pig latin
luckily Botify stepped in to create a Rosetta stone
(eventually there will be a system to avoid bot on bot conflict)
I've never seen the British version to compare it, but I would imagine an actively mean boss would create more punchlines than a Dumb but well meaning boss
I also tried to watch Parks and Rec and gave up on that
Parks and Rec is great.
what?
I totally missed this originally
im certain you were involved
i was asking for things to in boston that were not food/ drink centric- i believe you sent a great list
this was the list and i italicized the ones i did
I APPRECIATE YOUR EXISTENCE DREW
<@UHQD9J1SL> you should also add Shitfaced Shakespeare to your list, but that's good year round
I just didn't know where the guys paying to keep you company comment came from
Pretty sure we were saying that people would buy Aysh drinks
Also good morning!
Summon the Silent
summon the silent
:sadpanda:
Nope, you cannot summon
<@UDL020K8D> Where is _channelUtil suppose to exists within Summon?
:close_enough:
:close_enough:
<@UDBGH9BMX>
Let's see can I?
Summon the Silent
Summon the silent
Looks like no one can today
No, the bot itself is defective.  I'm assuming it was doug who made the invalid reference but we could also try blaming Dakota
Oops, can fix
Why not blame both?
try again
Summon the silent
YEA!!!!
thanks!
Why did it ping twice?
Yeah, but seriously!
That happens when you correct an error. 
Broken events stick around in the queue 
That's an amazing amount of scrunchies
You're like my friend back in college who had cheap sunglasses and shoes in almost every color. Was always color coordinated
I'm more like the friend who bought a bag of 60 socks, none of which match, so they don't have to ever worry about a losing one or making them match
Yup, that’s a good way. I had a friend who did that. 
ALL THE PINGS!!!
I'm not gonna lie, I don't wake up early enough to have time for that kinda shit
My morning is pretty much planned out to the minute
But CJ, your scrunchies must be in terrible disorder then. 
My life is in terrible disorder
I just arranged them for this picture and them threw them into a bag.i was late to work too, but I have priorities.
Getting the munchkin out the door on time so I don't have to run for the train is my priority
Not true anymore, but I used to buy only one type of sock, so I could grab any two socks from the drawer and they'd match
BEST STRATEGY EVER!!!!
I don't have to care what I grab if it all goes together!
I have only one type of white sock, and one type of black hiking socks that are good when it’s wet out. 
everyone should wear uniforms
Ah, just saw a new orange line again. Going opposite direction again. 
Nooooo NO uniforms
Too much effort
Going to go full Zuckerberg on us?
<@UDC4QL95G> man you want a fun read, the non-work politics discussion about the downed 737 in iran is pretty epic
dont i already?
It's even got the classic, I have a Ph.D statement
My high school moved to a uniform while I was there, but they didn’t make the change for us seniors. So glad I missed it. 
Oh, that one is a sad story. 
The story is terrible
The shit show argument it spawned is hilariously sad
Oh shit, one just happened? That’s not the story I was thinking of. 
Yea last night in Iran a 737 crashed, people are wondering if was friendly fire from the Iraqi bombardment
I went to school with a few muslim friends who started wearing a hijab towards the end of high school because dressing up for 5 am classes was too much
Stupid question.... How is wearing a hijab less effort? Or what is it less effort than?
then stopped bothering when they started college
you could wear PJs and wear this cloak on top and no one would know
oh
the fun read isn't about the crash
it's a dude spouting boeing conspiracy theories
in the 737 max thread
It's not even a 737 max which is why it's really funny
yeah, it's a hell of a tangent
Did you see his orignal posts before he edited them?
I was sad he made them more tame
nope
I moved to make all my underwear at least the same brand and size (not same pattern due to logistics of buying underwear). Trying to do the same with my socks
/roll 1d20 + 5
There was literally a `I have a Ph.D in material sciences` statement that was rather long
beat me to it
damn
dragon ate you though
I'm pretty good with a shotgun hence the +5, but Dragons definitely take more than a 12
I should've rolled with advantage
nope, the DM bot tells you when to roll with advantage
Oh, nevermind then
trump is going to address the nation at 11am
this'll be interseting
:ohno:
5 AM!!!!!!
Wait I missed that, class started at 5????
yeah, I'd never show up to school at 5am
Fat orange blob taking a while to get to the podium
Clearly his ability to make you wait on him shows how powerful he is
something tells me drew is not a fan of our president
he is objectively bad at walking. politics either way, that bit is true
My whole life has been trying to find a daily uniform I can wear. I loved wearing a uniform in school
:luffy_vomit: :vomit: :face_vomiting:
Yes, he has power. That's the problem.
I think my high school started at like 7:30 and that was oppressive. no one is in the right mind to learn at 5am
Why would I be?
I thought it was bad enough waking up at 5 to then get to classes
FYI, sarcasm, this is what weak people think power is.
That's fair. The guy still has power because he is the president. That's the problem to me, and why I'm waiting to see what he says because he can unfortunately cause a lot of stupid ramifications
If only the republicans put country over party we wouldn't have to deal with this shit
High school started at 8:20am and went till 3:25pm. Odd choices for operating hours.
link?
It's making a case stronger than ever about the need to make it viable to 3rd parties to not be secondary parties. You need ranked voting to make that happen though
it was like- college admission prep outside of regular school
Or at the very least the elimination of first past the post for just about any other system that commands "you just have 50.001% of the vote to win"
&gt;50%, I'm not sure how they write it in the most simple unable to be misconstrued way
I'm watching on the Washington Post site
so he's already 26 minutes late
is it live yet?
my stream isn't
just went live
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wh>
only a half hour late
That's crazy to me "Broadcast at 11am...plus previews of nothing"
I've got a meeting so give me a good Synopsy please
holy crap, does he always sound like he's dying?
dying? he sounds aloof
like he things he is the direct cause of the fact that there were no casualties
just called the iranian general the worlds top terrorist
trained terrorist armies
civilian targets
wounded and murdered 1000s of us troops
dismembered their victims
directed attacks against us personnel in iraq
orchestrated assault on us embassy in bagdad
I mean just how he sounds when he's talking. Like, heavy breathing, sniffling, monotone, nasally, etc.
should have been killed long ago
this is a powerful message
he  sounds a lot more ocmposed than usual?
"if you value your own life, you will not threaten our people"
they chanted "death to america" instead of thanking us
they created hell in yemen syria afganistan and iraq
they did these attacks with funds given to them by the last administration
THERE WAS A DEAL WITH IRAN. IT WAS CALLED THE IRAN DEAL
ONE THAT WAS WITH ALL THOSE COUNTRIES THAT YOU MENTIONED
calling for uk germany to withdraw from the iran deal
calling for new deal
tolereighted isn't a word trump
we've achieved energy independence
our economy is stronger than ever
we're the #1 producer of oil and gas in the world
we don't need middle east oil
he spend 2.5 trillion to rebuild the US military
oh, sweet
"our missiles are big, powerful, lethal, and fast"
we destroyed 100% of ISIS last year
News to me
By territory, that is true. 
But that is not the only metric of course. 
That was a whole lot of nothing. Or worse, propoganda read off a teleprompter
I feel like that got more frequent again
&gt; As long as we refrain from yet another needless war in the Middle East, I'm perfectly content with just another day of stupid.
-reddit
I'm sad that we're losing soft power every day and we're making conflicts out of (relatively) peaceful, or de-escalating situations. But at least we're not at war yet.
Yeah, I was watching that expecting things to ratchet up immediately.
I'm happy that we're not at war. I was a bit concerned about that last night
I'm still not convinced half of that wasn't just propoganda or lies. Iran telling its people one figure for casualties, and our country reporting the exact opposite, and here I am unable to write off the Iran figures as pure propoganda
I actually doubt that we had any casualties. I feel that would come out pretty quickly. BUT I think it might have been bigger damage than we're told, especially cause we haven't seen any pictures of it afaik. Mainly it's trump trying to save face cause he said (iirc of course, I don't want to have to find exactly what he said) that if Iran responded to the assassination of the general, we'd respond. Still, I'm very happy we didn't
Yeah, I was watching preparing for "I'm urging congress to declare war" and instead got "Let me read this teleprompter"
"read" might be a bit of an overstatement
He honestly looks super sick
I mean he fucked up tolerated
Anyway, crisis averted temporarily, I'm ready to go back to whatever I was doing for my day off
oh, day off. I was wondering how you were watching it at the bar haha
have fun!
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2020/01/07/former-wayfair-employee-files-sexual-harassment-lawsuit/2ksjtGtGhuXWStAP5GlFDJ/story.html>
who has thoughts?
It was so slow the past couple days that I've been more active on Slack on my phone at work
they needed that 30 minutes to drug him up
afaik, we're pretty good about not doing that, but I don't know anything about it
afaik, we're pretty good about not doing that, but I don't know anything about it
lol- pretty god about not thinking?
pretty good about responding to sexual harassment claims positively, at least, as far as it appears to me from what HR says. But this article quotes emails and formal communication, so that'd be pretty hard evidence
Eh, everything at wayfair has become very automated when it comes to stuff like this. I wouldn't be surprised if it did happen
Says associate director of Industrial engineering at Wayfair, but she's removed that from her linkedin recently
From the article, seems like there would be some pretty cut and dry evidence of Wayfair's wrongdoing. If true, would be very troubling
Like, if
&gt; When Forsythe reported the man’s actions to her supervisor, the lawsuit alleges, the subordinate verbally abused her in front of her boss, prompting her boss to remove the subordinate from her team. The lawsuit says Forsythe’s boss acknowledged that Forsythe’s subordinate “could not control himself in attacking her.
could be corroborated, that's pretty obviously a thing happening
And I GUARANTEE there are slack logs about it
Do you like slow days, or prefer busy ones?
that, or it's the standard "power move" of making the other party wait for you even though you're doing nothing
It's also pretty substantial and easy to see claims about voluntary resignation, which from the article she had even planned continued work travel, etc.
db confirms she was an associate director
yea, and they can probably compare the "agressive" emails with true metrics and such
I prefer properly staffed busy ones. So like a Friday or Saturday rush
I've had a few "We won't hire a barback during the day despite the GM seeing personally how many instances one would be useful" and those are frustrating, not fun.
And I could definitely see something like this happening. My only hangup is that from everything I've seen, supervisors and managers are very responsive to perceived harassment - that's just the culture I've seen so far. But I'm silo'd into the engineering, sf side
I could see that
Oh is there a term date in the system still?
This was industrial engineering for the warehouses. I wouldn't put it past some of the men I worked with to not handle it in the best way
term date?
There used to be a termination date in the Employee tables
she was an AD at 33 ? :open_mouth:
2019-09-24 00:00:00.000
yeah
AD at 33 good or bad?
probably not a great idea to go poking around in a database that's likely going to be used as evidence in a federal court case
i just found one thing i didnt get- she denied having non-work related meals with this guy but had lunch after he was moved to another team?&gt;
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
AS at 33 is a huge deal I would think ? level 5
Yea, I didn't really get that either <@UHQD9J1SL> - I'm just guessing he worked on a related team so they still had to meet
depends on how often you hop jobs.
Yeah, can have multi team lunches, etc
Anyway, the idea of someone at her level claiming on the 19th to be leaving, and then being gone less than 2 weeks later seems out of character
Especially since the suit was brought 3 days after that date but 2 days before the termination
honestly the handling of this sounds so appalling that i cant  believe it. :confused:
and if its true then...its worrying
we don't have a :2020: emoji yet
I'm mildly tempted to upload a trump emoji just for the fireworks
I'm not sure if it's true, but wayfair covering it up if true is something they have a habit of, especially when potentially unlawful termination is involved
WHY though! im not denying they could have.... but what about this male employee was so special that they risk all this instead of reprimanding/ firing him ?
I don't know the answer to that. Happens a lot unfortunately
:20::20:
I hate it...but I love it
year of the 20/20
seems strong
there is a strong combo where you can get it on turn 2. only available in old powerful formats. Dark Depths + Thespian's Stage
wait, this one is better
Aysh, don't attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity
It's less likely that people are trying to protect this one person and more like, this isn't _that_ big of a deal.  Till you know it is
When the article said that the Supervisor denied what happened... that's when it gets a bit sketchy that it's just "stupidity" or "oversight"
Or it's the fact you're only getting one side of the story meant to paint Wayfair in literally the worst possible light
I dont buy that there was no personal involvement between these people if they met in private and off campus AFTER this guy was forced to move teams.
To me these things are reserve judgment till all facts come to life or innocent till proven guilty.  A filing doesn't prove anything, it just makes accusations.  I can make any accusation I like
Yup, that's why all the facts are important. I said things look sketch if true, and they *should* be able to prove it if all the things she said are true
<@UDC4QL95G> do you want to brenden's together after work?
We might have to tie a rope between us so we don't get lost in the blizzard that's here
sure. I need to stop for some booze though
wanna hit up star market or the crappy place
This is tough, do we want a good selection or convience?
Or I could go with being out in the snow as little as possible
Preference?
selection + better price has me leaning towards star market
I'm good with either, I could go for some sake tonight
INTO THE SNOW WE GO!
Silence Chaos Seed
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UETS9HTSS> Do you want us to get anything at Star Market that we'll conveniently forget to get?
I recently picked up some beer
<@UPGVCMGD9> is tonight the night for breaking open the big bottle we co-own?
Yeah why not
guys
I've made it
my name has entered #nonwork-no-context
Nice!
are they talking about the last name thing again?
Ummmmmm ok
last name thing?
no I asked if we have emojis for the various wayfair customer archetypes
and :sheila: is a couch
which I found confusing
where employee last names are products on site
oh, I hate that
don't get me started
Woot! I bought a bottle of mezcal and brought some lime juice because if <@UETS9HTSS> still has Aperol and Yellow Chartreuse, we're drinking Naked and Famous...es
Why do you need to be naked to drink Famous..es
I still have those <@UDC03KCGK> :hy::pe:
Woot woot!
Also it is such a random name for a drink, but it's awesome
Also Dakota can you check if Star Market has Smoke and Dagger? It's a beer by Jack's Abby
Black, grey, and purple can
Because it's you asking, me and CJ are virtually guaranteed to forget
That is a fantastic beer btw
It might be simple but margaritas would be an option too
I'm not sure if I have agave syrup
I'll check and ask dakota/cj to grab some if I don't have any
<@UDC4QL95G> when do you want to leave? We have to go to star market
<@UDC03KCGK> *hint* use `/bot list`
I'm godd whenever
Did it. Forgot about a couple of these
Want to head down now?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom first meet you in the lobby?
yeah
:salute_cap:
I mean, agave is nice but you don't have to have it to make a margarita. Arguably you do to make it right, but most bars, even high end ones, won't bother to carry it.
Why did you want me to check it though?
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UDDE5960N> please pick up a bottle of tres agaves agave syrup
at star market it's along the left wall of the liquor section looking from the top of the stairs
also tonic water would be good as well if you can remember
but no worries if not
If the agave is next to the tequila, they don't have it
Or instead moved it. Found it. Smaller bottle than before though
shouldn't be next to the tequilla
should be by all the non alcoholic mixers
Yup, found it, just smaller bottle
Short of it: they take it very seriously and did a comprehensive investigation and "did not find any merit to the allegations". Includes links to our policies and ways for anonymous (third party) tips to possible issues
<@UDC03KCGK> always
Good morning monkeys!
<@UDC03KCGK> the most naked and famous
<@UDC4QL95G> the companion and savior
<@UDDE5960N> the one you know is around
<@UDBGH9BMX> the one still trying to explain the rules
<@UPGVCMGD9> the one we never explained the rules to
<@UK7V13DS7> the "angry one"
<@UDL020K8D> the absent one
<@UHQD9J1SL> the omnipresent one
Companion and Savior?
I assume he got drew home at some point
Ohhhhh shit got real after I left apparently
you have no idea
but I'd like to know
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW!!!!!!
I read the court filing and it looks like the news reporting at least something inaccurately
 The one I specifically had questions about 

This is just...sad :pensive:
Is
I wanna see how much he remembers first
It’s going to be hard to piece that one together from context. 
boooooooooo, he's probably dead to the world right now
<@UDL020K8D> context lives here
he sobered up a lot by the time we got to the bar, but that didn't last long
lol
CJ, I just meant since it was a single redacted word
Ohhh i get that, I was just pointing out where it came from
Ok
Drew's lack of response is slowly killing me
:bug:
That's not a :bug: that's just 2 bots going at the same time
It's not my fault I have all the bots!
their lack of interaction is a bug
your normal bot response should be redacted
That is a feature, not a :bug:
I maintain that your normal bot response should be redacted
you are more than welcome to refactor all of the code to sperate out trigger and
:wtf:  :sparkletrooper:
the :wikipedia: seems so weird that A) we didn't have it, and B) we needed it
I hate everything
My memory of the situation is not to be trusted given all the things I'm reading. What I "remember" was making a lot of cocktails at Brenden's, and having a couple shots of beer that Brenden had brought out. We played Hyperborea, which we just decided to end when Dave had to go home. We then switched to Go Nuts for Donuts, but I don't remember anything about scoring. Then we played Hearts, which I don't know why it ended but I got the impression it was because I was too drunk. Which I didn't feel that drunk. 
Dakota and I went on the T to Park. Don't remember what the hell we talked about, but was conscious for it. Park had stopped serving food at 11 instead of midnight. Ordered a Last Word for Dakota (worst drink choice for him, surprised he finished it) and I think a shot of scotch. I only remember ordering one drink for myself, but it tasted bad and I tried not to finish it. 
Then I was puking... somewhere. Then in an Uber Dakota called on my phone. Then more puking outside my apartment. 
Then woke up in bed. Door was still unlocked so I assume Dakota got me to bed and then left.
I don't remember taking any of Dakota's shots, just telling him to finish one which he did. 
Brenden also showed me the mezcal bottle before I left and we had basically killed it, which is weird because it is an equal parts cocktail, so we should have killed both the Aperol and Yellow Chartreuse first. So must have fucked up measurements at some point
So <@UDC4QL95G>, fill in your side please
Holy fuck
"shot of scotch"?
such a cute story!
Also apparently we missed a Lyft. Also when we did catch an Uber, it was 1:40am, and we got to my place around 2. 
For context, we were at Park around 11:30. I don't know where approximately an hour and a half went
And my arm hurts as if I got socked really hard in the deltoid.
<@UDC4QL95G> did Drew fight someone?
no, that was when we were at brendens, and he was tring to get more to drink, i grabbed his arm and wouldn't let him past
i warned him his arm was gonna hurt today as a result
also if that lyft driver tries to charge you dispute the charge. Dude pulled up and wouldn't let us in the car. we didn't miss it
you guys had quite the night
Good to know because they did charge me
So, please tell me did I puke in the Uber?
you did a bit! but you puked in a cup I brought from the bar for that specific reason.
Ok, so no puking on the guys seat or anything. Ugh that would've been the worst
So what happened? We were clearly at Park past closing time!
nah I figured you wouldn't make it all teh way back, so I got a big plastic cup from the bar. I let you rest at the bar till it closed (and maybe a bit later) and dragged your ass to the Harverd stop where the final train had already left
so I called a lift but the dude didn't let us in. so I called an uber
at park we literally just sat at the bar and chatted
I think I ordered you another drink after the shot of scotch, not sure though
So I didn't puke at Park?
I knew it was a bad thing when I was leaving at 9 and an already drunk Drew was pouring more (very strong) drinks :upside_down_blob:

Was fun though :poke-laugh:
<@UDC03KCGK> I showed you the aperol bottle, not the mezcal
Hilarious shit show of a night apparently
So no one won at Hyperbora?
I think we stopped playing hearts because Drew wanted to make another drink but was slurring every word he said and Dakota and I stepped in to prevent said drink
what new bot is this?
MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That one is all CJ 
there's a bug, it ate a space between `and` and `brenden`
yea I saw that I need to fix it
Also there's a bug between I think and Brenden thinks, but I have no idea how to solve that
Just call it intended behavior. 
<@UDC4QL95G> You have any tips for getting goodwill board games?
best tip is to check literally every day
the goodwill is on my way home, so it's hard to not stop by
Yea good will seems like a roulette game, the more bets you make the likelier you are to hit it big
Ah, okay. Lmk if you see anything you already have and is good :slightly_smiling_face:
I feel like there's a story here
Good morning!
Summon the silent
Yeah I've accepted this to be true. Once you accept it there is nothing left to fear. We are now invincible.
lol
Mine seems to be missing a few words
Nahhhhh it's got all the words
Eh, not much of one. I went to the symphony last night, it was a good performance, so I posted a gif. 
Ahhhhhhhhhh, well I'm glad you enjoyed the symphony
What missing words. Sounds accurate
It's Friday.
Friday
Know what that means?
Very bad rap?
See the thing is, reading is hard especially if you emphasize the wrong words
It means ........
Actually it means nothing. Just another day.
It means that tomorrow is "free time" that's actually me just doing stuff for other poeple
Maybe.... or maybe i just fill in words, we'll never know

Nope.

Uhhhhh reviews are terrible
mmm, thanks anyway. Turns out bolding custom text on the internet isn't a solved problem in 2020
That's kinda funny
Ugh Dave, I can HEAR that emoji
lol
&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;
that's all I got
/mega bigstrongcry
Actually I'll be in boston tomorrow in the afternoonish, does anyone want to do something?
I might be brewery hopping :thinking-tilted:
Fancy
Anywhere good?
Unsure
There aren't many I haven't been to yet
Hopefully at least one of those
Bearmoose is one I have in mind
lol
You're gonna have to start keeping track because you'll be doing a second circut soon
almost forgot to charge my phone! don't want to be stuck half-way across town after the trains shut down with a vomiting person and no phone again!
LOL THE BOT KNOWS
At least tonight is a friday so you won't be the only one that happens too
<@ULLQNJ8LX> knows all
oh yeah, forgot to mention my phone was dead and I had to coax drew's password out of him. I also kept locking it out of habit and needing the password again
Lol I mean if other people are doing it's lame, you have to do it on a Wednesday to be cool
exactly!
That makes this story soooo much better
second circuit?
also, i realized when i got back to drew's house that I had no coat, but i also no longer had drew's phone
I figured you made him pay for the uber because it was his fault, not because you had no phone
So was it a long cold walk in the dark?
HOW DID YOU GET HOME!?!?!?! I NEED TO KNOW NOW!!!!!!
I unhooked drew's switch and charged my phone at his place
:thinksmart:
Well once you're done with all the breweries you have to visit them all again
LOL!
you assume I haven't visited them twice
Good thing they're USB-C
Yea but once you've visited them all
You have to visit them all again
that's for sure
Alls well that ends well
When I woke up the next day, I called drew's phone a couple times hoping somebody would pick it up. then drew texted me and all was good.
LOL!
and so here I am at work, in a rain coat, in 30 degree weather
I can only imagine drew squinty eye trying to make the phone stop trying to murder his skull
As dakota calls for the 4th time and drew curses the world
HAHAHAHAHAHA, rain coat isn't really warm enough though
oh for sure. I called it twice, and then 10 minutes later he texted me back with "are you ok?"
"you were calling me  and i clearly was not ok last night. did you make it home?
And you're like "BITCH OF COURSE I AM, AND YOU'RE STILL ALIVE SO I"M GOOD NOW!"
Nah i was more like "OH SHIT I DIDN'T LOSE HIS PHONE!!"
and went to sleep
LOL!
I was fully confident he would survive the knight
there was no way there was enough of anything left in his stomach to drown himself in his sleep
My favorite part of this story is now thinking about you in Drew's living room being like, no jacket, no Drew phone, dead my phone. WHAT DO I DO??? A SWITCH I CAN CHARGE MY PHONE! Cue Dakota sitting on the floor for the next 5 minutes playing the switch while his phone charges
Well i'm not retyping that
oh god... i dont want to try. lemme put it into text-to speech
It's pig latin, it'll sound so fucked up
yeah but it looks fucked up too
I give up after "my favorite part of..."
Basically I find that whole event of you at drew's place funny
There's not a moment of that even that's not hilarious
now imagine that drew is fully incapable of walking by himself and the shenanigans involved in getting him through several locked doors
And getting him to open said doors of objects/info with the ability to do that
nah I did the door opening, but I failed several times. I was pretty damn drunk at the time as well
this was not a sober person taking care of a fully drunk dude. this was a drunk dude taking care of a black-out drunk dude.
Yea but it's not like you have the required stuff to open the door, so you have to get it off of drew
God I wish someone had filmed this
Like, my whole memory of the night is just flashes of clarity were I realized i needed to focuz enough to not freeze to death
not that i realized i didn't have a coat until after I called my own uber
I kinda feel bad for leaving, but everyone was in a good state of mind when I left so there's no way I would know that this would have happened
lol this happened long after we left brendens. this was just me and drew
Well I meant you guys leaving shit faced from brenden's to continue drinking
I was in a good state of drunken-ness. Drew was already browning out though
I managed to shoot the moon in a game of hearts though
so that was neat
No idea what that even means
in hearts points are bad. but if you get literally ALL the points in any given round, instead of getting the points, everybody else gets the max value of points
So high risk/high reward
yeah. I thought I screwed up too but it worked out in the end
alternately, you can subtract all the points from your score if you shoot the moon
so -26 to yourself, or +26 to everyone else
I prefer the idea of :middle_finger: to everyone else
without html injection*
Is anyone done with their reviews?
Nope!
I've barely started
Same
I wrote most of one of the four competency good stuff
Ewwwwww
Not even your peers?
I drafted a couple of those
Didn't submit any though
only have 4 this time around
thank goodnesss
last time I had 9
You suck
I had 8?
I have 7 this time.
have not started them
i have 11.. :disappointed:
Damnnnnn Dakota
What god did you piss off
jesus
I translated it for the most part
Yes, I was browning out, which sucks because it meant I would come to fully conscious and not realize I'd done stupid shit between Go Nuts for Donuts and Hearts. Hell, when we were getting done with Hearts I just figured people were tired and it was late. 
It wasn't till I was about to black out that Dakota had an argument with me saying I was taking his shots of Jameson.
And that was after we'd ordered drinks at the bar. When we got to Park, I actually felt pretty good! Didn't realize there were pieces missing
It’s 65 degrees out right now. so warm. 
Yea it kinda sucks
..... I'm thankful
It was nice to be able to go out and take a nice walk. Although it got really windy at a couple points. 
/roll 1d20+3
That's not right, its
/roll 2d20k-1 +3
Oh, missed disadvantage. 
Time to do my self reveiw!
Same, and 11 peer reviews...
I did about half mine last night, then binged The Witcher to avoid thinking about more of them. 
I've finished like 4 peer reviews so far.
Ewwwwwww how far are you now?
I took a break and have completed 1 since
where are you now dakota
Self and manager review left. Taking another break
not bad
Eh I've never been good at writing these reviews anyway.
lol
Mostly things people need to improve on
Have any of you ever been on the same team before
no
Yes
WHAT!!?!?!
I was on Doug's team when I started
Ohhh right you and doug right?
Please tell me you reviewed their chaos monkey/game play style
This was looong before chaos monkey. 
Like he is great at work but God does he need to work on his deception games
HAHAHAHAH
That is less fun
Lol I don't know if I ever did a peer review for Doug. That was 3 years ago
No fun unless it was a peer review. Are those new??? I figured that they have been around for awhile
Yeah, but you only pick a few people to do your review.
Generally people you interact with on a regular basis
The team was huge back then as well.
We probably did peer reviews for each other. We worked closely on the Handy project. 
True, but right after that was the major reorg, so depending on timing, it could have been a long time till the next review
lol
Actually the reorg happened over Christmas.  so there is good chance you are right
All done
I'm off for the night
and that was the last time they ever saw CJ
:rip::cj:
Oof that was awful. I hate self reviews. Glad to be done now
I haven't procrastinated so much on writing since college.
but its done now.
Worse part was it's not even like I procrastinated on them.  I just ended up busy
Good Morning Monkeies! We survived reviews!
Summon the silent
I still have manager reviews to do. This is insensitive. I take offense.
Also, I hate lizards!
Good morning :sun_with_face:
Huh
I mean I do too but peer feedback is a bitch
/roll 1d20 +4
You got a good one. :)
PLAYING CARDS WITH MY BREAKFAST SANDWHICH FUCK YEA!
Why do you get plus 4? Because you can drive a stick shift?
Fuck yea, also my sweet sweet parking skills and proficiency
Are there rules to how we add plus numbers?
Nope
If it has something to do with art I'm totally giving myself a -2
Oh I'd give myself a -1 because I consider woodshop an art. However "drawing" or "painting" and I'm getting a negative 4
I mean if you're talking dnd rules a negative is like not having that skill at all
that's scoring like a 2 in dex
Orges and animals have int that high
CJ is right, by DnD standards that’s saying you’re as good at art as a houseplant
But this isnt DnD it’s chaos monkey. 
I just use 5E rules because they make the most sense to me
I find it funny that workday apparently went down yesterday for a while
I thought it was saturday it was down
you right.

/roll 1d20
dammmmmm
motherfucker didn't even see me
that's one of the scariest creatures in D&amp;D
it reflects spells at the caster
:phew_3:
it eats cities
huh, so you are saying that even with a 20 i probably didn't get away?
It’s a CR 30. 
nah, you probably got away
you're beneath its notice
`Drewid`
/roll 1d20+2
Hm, that’s happening a lot. I’ll turn down the frequency when I get back to my desk. 
Would 10 equal just +0 in 5e?
Yeah. It’s like human average. 
I never learned the DnD rules well enough. My experience with Gloomhaven is showing me that I do not do well with learning rules by fucking up
<@UDL020K8D>  Tarrasque? Or <@UETS9HTSS>
Brenden posted it in the channel. Giant dinosaur monster. 
Yeah, I'm sleep deprived and just saw that
John Jacob Jingle Heimer Smith, I need 12 hours of sleep!
/roll 1d20-2
Sounds right
LOL!
So if I'm a 12 in 5e for a stat, is that +1 or +2?
+1
Mod = (Stat-10)/2 rounded down
So 12/13=+1
I think this is more of a hold over from previous editions where 20 was a max and each level had more impact
Isn't 20 still the max?
So yeah, I'm tired enough for a 6
Yea, I think they left that but then had to do weird math because they simplified other stuff
Well, all in all, me being tired warrants a 6 right now

Ohhhh I thought we were going with `Dude where's my Car` and I was gonna make fun of you for getting the phrase wrong
I forget her name, but I don't miss her
I have no idea who she is
I have history with that movie
she was a youtuber who made dumb videos
I saw one or two
Mmmm
It's not very interesting history, but I didn't think anyone else knew that movie
I mean pretty female is guaranteed to get creepy views
That's how the internet works right?
What do mean that movie has such dumb humor. IT'S GREAT!
`<https://www.reddit.com/r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG/>`
<https://www.reddit.com/r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG/>
yup that's how the internet works
who dis
I never watched it
THEN HOW DO YOU HAVE HISTORY WITH IT!?!?!?1
It has to do with my mom and Disney World
Kinky
:gross_blob:
HAHAHAHAHAHA I don't know what you want me to tell you dave
I was 8
When that movie came out
what movie!
:dude: :whereswaldo: :my: :car:
oh i only know that a movie by said name existed
Jesus you were young
Anyway movie is full of stupid humor
and i mean _*stupid*_
I was also not in America
Yea, 8 is young
I was also in Disney World shortly after it came out
I want it to be 5pm
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED!?!?!
and then he found $5
It was actually really silly
Incorrect
JUST TELL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No, cause I haven't done anything that I want to do today so I need it to not be 5
:uhoh:
I was a scardykid and didn't like going on any of the rides. So I was terrified anytime we were in line for a ride
And?
And for some reason, we kind of conflated "Hey Dude" with "Hey Jude". So, to help take my mind off of the scariness of the ride, my mom would be like "Hey Dude, where's my car..." in the style of "Hey Jude" by The Beatles.
We knew nothing about the movie, other than the fact that the movie "Hey Dude, Where's my Car" existed
interesting
Told you it was really silly and not too interesting
Anyway it's like a funny movie because the people in it are dumb as hell
I have a teammate who is quite into board games, she might play race with us via phone; should I invite her to <#CDBT6UTCL|game-night-schemes> ?
I think the better question is who shouldn't we invite

I am of the opinion that this bot should be turned down as well

Is it spelled wrong intentionally...
no idea
ok, I added an alias to WF with the correct spelling.
will make it to this channel laster today.
:4: none of the above `1`
<@UDC4QL95G>
(could you look at the message that was sent and find the markdown or whatever that it uses to make that button appear correctly?)
5) Ingredient
Nope. It is considered an `attachment`.  I could make a bot post a message that had the proper formating though
the real answer is that cereal is a salad.
booo low effort addition
Cereal is not a salad
Could you edit your message in the log and add that attachment and have it reflected on slack?
a combination of uncooked ingredients.
same way pasta salad is a salad
sashimi is a salad?
clearly I'm priced into saying yes to that now
well, sashimi with ginger/wasabi
I do not believe so. The edit command just takes in a new string. We are hooked up to slack events, thus why the original message must appear first before being deleted and replaced with a bot. I am also unable to edit user messages directly without having access to their private tokens
wait, isn't the pasta in pasta salad cooked?
also a salad is still a salad if you add cooked ingredience
yes, but its mixed in the bowl and not cooked at that point
ah gotcha
the final step just has to be mixing. and usually salad is cold.
wait, but then isn't a sandwich a salad?
it doesn't really all mix together
it does if you put bread in the middle
like a big-mac
if you cut a sandwich and dump it in a bowl.
basically that's what a taco salad it
Oh, we count anything as a salad if cooking it isn't the final step?
PB&amp;J
Burrito
:ah_hmm:
Anything that isn't cooked and _*MIXED*_ together
<@UDBGH9BMX> if you cut and mix them. like a taco salad
so actually, sashimi is not a salad, but poke is
This may be a bit pedantic, but water and ice/lemonade?
under this definition, sounds like yeah, lemonade is a salad
Cold soup (if you don't cook it, not sure if there are any)
(the definition should probably have some thing about things being solid, but that might undermine byt original claim about cereal)
Minestrone?
ah, no, minestrone is cooked together, just served cold. nevermind
no bake brownies are *possibly a salad
they have a little chemical stuff which I'm sure if I want to count. same with ceviche
ah, I should have said salad dressing.
but ive also had cooked salads
? really?
I thought a cooked salad was a casserole.
what kind of salad was this?
also, it'd be more soup than salad at this point
is Chex Mix a salad?
I believe yes. samw with trail mix
Whey cant a salad be cereal
cereal is a subset of salad.
a cereal is a salad, a salad can be cereal but not laways
in what cases is a salad not a cereal?
like squares and rectangles
when its made of anything except cereal.
Cereal is a word for types of grain.
Except not all cereals are made of grain
like marshmello only trix
&gt; A *cereal* is any grass cultivated (grown) for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. The term may also refer to the resulting grain itself (specifically "*cereal grain*").
well, yeah, marshmallow "cereal" is an example of linguistic drift.
I disagree with this definition of salad
maybe its like fruit, there is a definition for a culinary salad and a different definition for a botanical salad.
Also, very related, since this is what made me ask the question:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5Po-Cjv28>
English Language Learners Definition of salad : a mixture of raw green vegetables (such as different types of lettuce) usually combined with other raw vegetables. : a mixture of small pieces of raw or cooked food (such as pasta, meat, fruit, eggs, or vegetables) combined usually with a dressing and served cold.
a cold dish of various mixtures of raw or cooked vegetables, usually seasoned with oil, vinegar, or other dressing and sometimes accompanied by meat, fish, or other ingredients.
I feel like either of these definitions would have short circuited a lot of the debate
yeah, but neither of those would allow me to claim milk as a salad
correct, because it's not a salad
Nah we are arguing based on technical definitions
you could argue that milk is a dressing and that cereal is a salad
English Language Learners definitions are far from technical
any definition with "usually" in it defines proper taxonomy
but not that milk is a salad
unless you count bacteria as small pieces of raw food
:several_people_are_typing:
Are chips in someone's mouth a salad?
can you have a 1 ingredient salad? That opens up a lot of new salads
which seems pretty far fetched
nah chips are grain, so it is cereal
:sure-jan:
is a potato a grain?
nope
i'd call lettuce shredded into a bowl a salad
<@UDC4QL95G> :bernie-finger-intensifies:
so Dakota clearly is thinking of corn chips
oh yeah i was
Haha, of all the directions I expected this discussion to take, the technical definition of a salad was NOT one of htem
When men make plans, god laughs
when god laughs, men make plans
When men make plans, god makes everything a salad* FTFY
when men make plans, men make plans
when god laughs, god laughs
actually I was thinking of toritos, which are tortilla chips
also a cereal chip. nice
Is everything either cereal or salad?
no, some things can be sandwiches
You forgot Sandwich
cassaroles
things are either: atomic, salad, or cassarole.
#nonwork-random is a hotdog a sandwhich
as has brutalism
yeah, we don't need that one
A hotdog Sandwich is like an ATM Machine
that's been banned
they're no longer allowed topics
and have their own channels
:banhammer:
that needs more alpha
I don't see anything wrong
don't be racist
rip `/ban` is broken
&gt; that escalated quickly
oh, I never set the slack bot to look for the new server for the other endpoints
:collapsing_thinking:
<@UETS9HTSS> easy solution is to not use dark mode
:iagree:
that's not a solution
I can't wait for <@UDC03KCGK> to post at like 4:00 today having read every message so far
there he is
welcome back to the living
Light mode is better than dark mode
:das-racist:
uhhhh
In everything EXCEPT Window's bottom bar
best deja vu ever
wait... how did we get a double dejavu
^was that deja vu? why did asysh get botted?
the first deja vu was deja vu'd
Wonder if we left out a "is a bot" check
I like it
nope, we have that check
keep it
:bug:
huh yeah that totally shouldn't have been possible
Wait, did Dakota post about me seeing this...after I had posted 10 minutes ago?
Or is mobile slack REALLY fucked up
don't fix it
a lot has happened in 10 mintes
I think there's something that <@UDDE5960N> should tell us...
well we can eliminate the bot check, but we need to make sure the isFromABot function isn't borked
I also forgot you posted about the definition
otherwise we may get into infinite loops... again
&gt; Dakota Quealy has come unstuck in time
Yea, I was a bit confused about that Drew...
Or maybe he was re-doing the loop :loop:
oh shit i didn't realize he had posted
Even though I responded to him
:lol:
:sorry-i-cant-work-today-because-i-have-cheetle-fingers:
incoming
yeah, infinite buzzfeed was a little much
you can say that again
You can say that again
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN
So why is Brutalism a banned topic in random?
oh yeah we did realize that bot was broken too
_*YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN*_
we just never fixed it
I've heard the what is a sandwich one.
if sandwich talk is banned so is brutalism
it was the compromise
I've got a pretty succinct rule on that one based on the grid usually presented for "what is a sandwich"
those were the two great arguments
you can say that again
this is production
not dev
wow that was unexpected
<#CDU145F08|megamoji_test_channel>
i didn't actually change anything
that was an exiting bug i just discovered
I cannot test the say again bot because I'm not on the impersonations list
Yeah, my phone went "wtf" at me
you can NOT say that again :got-em:
/roll 1d20+5
dakota
you suck
I was typing that to brenden's message but dejavu yoinked the spot
so.. it could go infinite? if dejavu triggered a "you can say that again" and then it loops?
not sure but now glitch is having memory issues :lol:
it also posted recent messages in order, not random from teh whole history
So, my original question before the bot bug problem was supposed to be "What is the debate about Brutalism?"
It can't comprehend the discussion about what what a salad is or isn't
Things are salads or they aren't, so you always have a 50-50 shot
I don't think that's how stats work, but I'll :shipittiny:
did the "fuck it ship it" emote get removed?
:f-it-ship-it:
`f-it`
oh, I was searching on the word fuck.
What's the Brutalism debate?????
whether it is terrible or not
Its just that when people do the hot dog thing diego talks about how much he likes brutalism, as a combo breaker
politics is active today
But do they know what a sandwich is?
do they know what a salad isn't?
Nahhhhhh
Of course. It's everything that's not a salad
Holy fuck.... Now I know how drew feels that was... Intense
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zThLokaiwxw>
&gt; I had a dream that my friend had a Strong Bad taco salad. It was the taco salad of my dreams.
That's so weird. My team was JUST talking about homestar runner in our internal chat today
Well, my ex-team
thinking of which, did you know the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon wasn't named after researchers, but rather after a West German terrorist organization? I just found that out today.
I feel like I have asked whawt the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon was before
Its the thing where you learn of something for the first time and then you see it everywhere.
Dave's comment isn't really an example, it just made me think of it.
I think there's another name for what I experienced? I mean, it IS similar
yeah.
frequency illusion.
that's sort of a general term
there may be something more specific, idk
What about the tread where I mentioned bots on infinite loops, followed by immediatly triggering one on accident
coincidence.
:darn:
ascribing meaning to coincidence? religion
that was me reading only the last 5 messages and not catching up :aup:
lol
That's the way to stay sane in this channel
if you don't see it live, it may as well have been silent
/roll 1d20
turns this into snapchat. channel with no history
Or it's a channel with lots of history and chaos
you can say that again
alright im turning off that bot
So I think a `return` was lost in the refactor
what is this dumb bot
it is the `you can say that again` bot
well someone really broke that.. badly
You can say that again
You can say that again
yeah deactivated it until I have time to fix it
&gt; _Due to a high volume of activity, we are not displaying some messages sent by this application_
I'm pretty sure it just tried to send the entire channel history
say again bot now locked to test channel
Man I've never seen you get the _`Due to a high volume of activity, we are not displaying some messages sent by this application.`_  Warning before dakota
Good job on activating every possible warning you can ever get
:achievement-unlocked:
I saw it once when I made a bot to add a reaction to every message ever in teh channel history
:chaos:
I reject this 100%
That was a shorter amount of chaos than I expected since I went to go do laundry.
Except for Dakota erroring out the system in new ways
happy to help!
Disney World. What are your feelings on it?
Never Been
Context: I'm listening to background loops from the parks rn
Go to Tivoli instead
too expensive for my family
It looks like they do audio stuff?
oooh, the park
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoli_(Copenhagen)>
I mean, it looks like a decent enough regional park
it was what Walt Disney based his park on
That's nice
Ah, that makes sense. But not to expensive for you now
Note: I'm not a huge disney enthusiast or anything, so I wouldn't be insulted if people hated the parks
True, but I have less interest in going now
same because I lived in another continent
I was actually going to say "how could you grow up in the US and not go to Disney World" at the start haha
There are a ridiculous number of adult fans of Disney World...
having been when I was much younger, and late high school, I can say that it holds more appeal to children
I'm a fan of roller coasters and the like, but not enough to justify a plane ticket and hotel stay just to say i've been to disney.
Yes, just one child likes disney
Never been until I was a adult. Had a friend who worked there so I went to the park for free hehehe
My cousin (in law) who is... 8ish years older than me is a big Disney fan and went with his 2 (similar aged) brothers for an extended weekend
Oooh, Mei, wanna hook me up with those free tickets
Well you don't go to Disney for the coasters
Copenhagen &gt; Lake Buena Vista, Florida
only florida has any meaning to me in that statement
In terms of theme parks, nah. In terms of most everything else? I'll allow it
Wait hold up those aren't even on the same continent!
He's saying that Trivoli is cooler than Disney World
The Danish are just so happy.
yeah, but i thought Trivoli would be somewhere in the US
Americans are awful when they are on vations
it's like comparing paris to new york
I think a lot of people do that
I like comparing apples to oranges
they are very comparable.
I prefer oranges while at home, apples while on the go
I like comparing soups to salads
<@UETS9HTSS> I agree - it is definitely a lot more fun with kids around
&gt; MEDICINE : ILLNESS ::
&gt; A. law : anarchy
&gt; B. hunger : thirst
&gt; C. etiquette : discipline
&gt; D. love : treason
&gt; E. stimulant : sensitivity
B
acgtually
i read taht wrong
one sec
A I'd say
I don't know how to do spoilers in slack
but yes, A is correct <@UDBGH9BMX>
Tho I went to Disney Land with a friend as part of my CA trip last year (eugh, I hate saying "last year" to mean 2019), and it was good fun without kids
:bow: :thankssss:
I studied/read a trick to do analogies way back when they were still on the SATs
&gt; PALTRY : SIGNIFICANCE ::
&gt; A redundant : discussion
&gt; B austere : landscape
&gt; C opulent : wealth
&gt; D oblique : familiarity
&gt; E banal : originality
E
yup
Trick: you just make a sentence of the 2 words and try to apply it to the answers. The only one it works with is the correct answer
yeah, I just googled SAT questions
"Medicine fixes illness" (I did "cures" originally, but that was too specific)
Only thing that made sense for was "Law fixes anarchy"
ayy I got it right. `/spolier`
"Paltry is a lack of significance"
Only one that made sense for was "Banal is a lack of originality"
basically you're verbalizing the relationship.
(sorry for spoilers if people really care about SAT questions)
damn. dunno what `banal` means
boring
Yup, but it makes it so much easier to figure out the relationship relative to the other words
more or less
dave had it pretty good with lack of originality
oh then yeah E
In case anyone finds themself needing to take the early 2000s SATs and needs a trick to get a good score. Back to the Future 4 starring <@UDC03KCGK> maybe
Never took the SAT
probably never will
you're from Illinios, right? you take the ACT?
yup.
Mom made me take both. and a couple SAT2s. sucked.
or colleges did. idk, someone did.
I got a decent enough score on my ACT that my parents were like "you can take it again if you want, your choice"
and i like :f-that:
I didn't do great on the SAT2s cause I didn't care or practice or prepare for em at all. But I did decently enough at the SATs
Never heard of SAT2
anyone take GRE?
They're subject tests - kinda silly
A lot of it is just straight memorization like "do you know this?"
is that the graduate one?
yeah
Nah not me
I hope to never need to go to grad school. I may need to get an MBA sometime, but hopefully not
sounds awful
I've taken:
&gt; SAT
&gt; ACT
&gt; SAT2 - Chemistry
&gt; SAT2 - Some sort of math
&gt; GMAT
If you go to collegeboard, you might still be able to find your scores haha
Found them:
Man, you knew your physics
Got a 5 on the AP as well
yeah, I'm not putting in any effort to looking them up. I know I got really good scores, but standardized tests are dumb.
after college we they should remove the old scores so no one uses them
I don't see my regular sat scores on the site
so perhaps those are gone
It's in a separate section
best part of standardized testing is the fact that we got off school early
sometimes entire days off as a result
They're prolly there
You shoulda been a physicist...
pay didn't seem there
though I still enjoy it
I don't think we actually got any days off or early releases... only thing we got time off for was AP/Finals
We had 3 days of standardized testing. if you didn't have a test on one of those days, you got to stay home
we had short days on finals as well
I don't have a ss bc it's on my phone, but my SAT2s:

Math: 650
Literature: 700
US History: 710
don't laugh at me bot, I didn't try and those are decent scores anyway
OH god those subjects look awful. Gimme brenden's tests any eay
I'm much more of a lit/language person anyway. Hate math
Literature and US history were like my worst subjects
I only got a 4 on the AP US test... I didn't know anything from it
I got a 4 on that one as well. I think I only got a 5 on Gov
So, AP tests. My teacher for Calc AB thought that I was going to fail the test. She pretty much said as much. I was riding a B that whole year, "getting it", but not completely.
I take the test, feel horrible about it, think I did awfully, didn't think I answered a single question right
Got the results back:
:five:
I didn't feel particularly good about my BC exam, but ended up with a 4
I ran to my teacher and was like "IN YOUR FACE MS POINTEK, YOU NEVER BELIEVED IN ME"

And she was like "noooo, of course I did" while having the most surprised face I'd seen on a teacher
I'm pretty sure they just mixed up my score and I actually got like, a 2
And then everyone clapped
Physics pays, but only after 10 years after your Ph.D
Sounds like Psych
Psych never pays unless you do terrible things to people
The show?
I've only done SAT and GMAT, but I did get the highest SAT for our schoold
The show is great
I assume the actors got paid pretty well
There was a dude at my school that got a perfect ACT
dude was a total junky and got arrested within the year
Why is dejavu triggering so often?
lots of messages in the main channel today
the spam earlier was not dejavu
We got a buncha geniuses working here
Makes me feel :he-smol:
:same:
aren't u one of the smarties?
this is a lie
Nah. like I said i only got one 5 on an AP test and only did decent on the ACT.
ehhhhh
well that part maybe. But everything else isn't
Don't worry dave, any raw potential is totally cancelled out by my sheer laziness
:this:
but u do things and people like it
That is just _calculated_ lazyness
<https://emoji.slack-edge.com/TDBEDSEQZ/peace-and-tranquility/859b9bf687cdb956.gif>
:peace-and-tranquility:
I do things that people like so I don't have to do more/other things
It's all about maximizing laziness
My PM was super impressed by me staying till 6:30 yesterday, he was like "You should come in at like 11 tomorrow"

And I was like "plz don't know that I got in this morning at 10:20"
hmmmmm this still exists <@UDC4QL95G>
yeah i just clicked the link pinned to the channel
good times
Dave `Don't worry I do that all the time`
look how far we have come
I know right!
now we completely alter sentences
and we are on bot number 3
I've never been either. First time I went to 6 flags I was 17, and Disneyland when I went to meet the parents back in senior year of college. I grew up never getting to go to any theme parks
Want to go the 6 flags in Springfield later this year?
Springfield IL?
Man, that's sad. <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> trip to Disney World
This feels like we're doing an improv comedy bit
Im game :shrug:  but Im afraid of roller costers
That's kinda funny to think about
We probably should have had Doug rename the bot in commemoration of bot v3
Sooooo we need to ride the tower of terror then Aysh
And all the most terrifyingly fast coasters
I never liked rides the just dropped straight down. Roller coasters are great though
Disney World doesn't really do coasters
Tower of Terror is cool tho - I don't do drop towers either, but ToT is good
Roller Coasters and Water rides were my favorite
It's more ride than drop tower
Universal is right next door and it does!
<@UDC4QL95G> Want to join my next roller coaster trip? :slightly_smiling_face:
lol
Eh, Universal has a few good coasters, but nothing amazing. Hulk is the best they have
You know what my favorite part is, you originally created bots for Emojis, and look at where we are now.
As I got older, I got super impatient waiting in lines for roller coasters
I only started doing coasters when I got older
like if it is more than a 10 minute wait, i just totally lost interest.
I'm only on board if we can get Aysh to piss herself in terror
:lol:
And Dakota this is why you get fast pass
I didn't do any real SAT prep. Ended up working out, but I'm also a little unprepared for these kinds of questions
Well, I mean, you shouldn't go on rides that scare you
Don't listen to Dave, the only way to over come your fear is to face it head on!
And preferably when I'm around for my amusement!
Hooray, I got it right (knew there'd be a spoiler in here)
Lol fast pass is expensive though! I'm impatient AND cheap
Disney Fast Pass+ is free
Six Flags it isn't. Just don't go on a weekend
Or go earlier in the morning
How does that work?
if everybody gets to go to the front of the line, doesn't that defeat the purpose?
You sign up for rides up to 30 days ahead of time
WTF
You sign up for times for each ride, and then you get an expedited line during that time
i guess that works
And then
30 days though?
It works pretty well actually. Just requires planning
60 days if you're a member :smile:
And then
So regular plebs like us can't get the best Fast Pass times bc all the members have taken them
You sign up for times for each ride, and then you get an expedited line during that time
<#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> Outing to Six Flags
<#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> Outing to Disney World
:seemsgood:
please- ill scream so loud all of you will lose your hearing.
dont they have single rider lines? those are the best
<@UDL020K8D> is this the News bot?
```News Posts a Buzzfeed headline for Ayshu 10.0% of the time.```
yeah
:lol: i like it
Some coasters have single rider. Most Disney rides don't. But riding with friends is so much better than solo riding
10%

PFFT

I can do 50%
Oh, I changed to 5%. I had it higher because I wanted to see it trigger once. 
DOES IT WORK!?!!?
I mean, we heard about Justin Bieber, so yes?
poor guy has lyme disease
I didn’t know that.
But I’m now thinking this bot was well tailored. :)
How to Demand Greener Investments for Your Retirement Account
not enough capitalization aysh
good try though
spotted a wild commit from Dave!
somebody wanna parse out this for me:
``` ISNULL(UPPER(LEFT(TypeName,1)) + STUFF(TypeName, 1, 1, '') + ' - ' + TcoName, 'Fees')```
Fckin that just capatlalizes whatever is in TypeName....
Only the first letter, dont know what stuff does
Stuff removes the first letter
Ooooh, I did the thing!

oh god, that file. That file is so awful - how they use SQL is :gross_blob:

yeah... a whole lotta not fun
Or it goes into the email?

<@UDC03KCGK> Do people order commonly order non-brunch cocktails before 5pm?
Like, do people stroll up to the bar at 11am and ask for a Manhattan?
They stroll up at 11:30 and get a beer
Not sure I've made too many cocktails before noon, but definitely several by 2
2 martini lunches used to be a classic business lunch. Back in mad men times. 
I could understand, if not personally desire, a beer. I'm kinda surprised at a cocktail by 2 haha
Isn't that kinda just being like "I'm not planning to do anything with my day"? Unless you're ordering it with food
On vacation, I've had cocktails before 2. But on a normal day, I generally don't
I don't want to know where my food comes from.  That's why I don't do Drew's job
....but Drew doesn't cook food as a job?
...and likely doesn't end up in the kitchen very much
:what-t:
You still learn too much!
Ignorance is bliss!
<@UDC4QL95G> say something here, I want to see if this works
wrong channel
???? <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> is never the wrong channel!
<https://games-club-external.slack.com/archives/CDR5ZBTT7/p1579108730166000>
I'd say it's the right channel
I meant to post in megamoji
didn't mean to suggest V was in wrong channel
Did you delete?
yeah
Got it!
hmmm, I guess that's fair. Tho by "vacation", do you mean "in a city" or "in a tropical place"
My Uncle is a chef. So there's that
Both
I guess my "I always get a headache after drinking" sours me on drinking really anything before 2. But it makes sense on vaca
Yeah I learned a lot from Park about how food is prepped and stored. Not as horrifying in many ways that people imagine. Much more horrifying in the ways they don't know to even think about
Yea, my dad co-owned a burger joint for a while. Some of the stuff is horrifying, but health inspections are also super strict
<@UETS9HTSS> gettin called out by my team for stealing talking points i brought to <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
wait, what?
lol our team has had the discussion several times. I thought Last time we had It i brought up the discussion about vegans and lab grown meat and vegans drinking human milk
I do vaguely recall that
:i_made_this:
now ask about drinking human milk :lol:
no, that would be weird
that's a <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> conversation
not a wayfair conversation
:lol: depends on the team I guess
I don't want people to associate me with human milk
I'll take the sandwich argument
I'll take chaos in #bos-cop-freefood
but not human milk
Alright, what about lab grown human meat
need to curate my image
and that doesn't help curate my image
and whether or not that is canibalism
I mean, that's a conversation that could potentially go to a terrible place
and I'd rather not go there
Wait I want to go there here, I want to talk about is lab grown human meat cannablism!
My concern is that if the group decides that it's not, suddenly you have to ask:
So if meat was never alive, it's not cannibalism?
No meat is inherently cannibalism, you need to eat it before that's possible
:duh:
Dave, I just want you to know you're not often wrong. But you are SOOOO WRONG here.  I love you buddy
:ok_hand:
`Cannibalism: the eating of the flesh of an animal by another animal of its own kind.`
veganism isn't about avoiding meat, its about avoid exploitation
I thought it was about not murdering animals?
that is a kind of exploitation
my answer to number 2 is "It depends on how the meat was sourced."
it's about a lot of different things for a lot of different people
My true answer to #3 is "Probably"
eating lab human meat is cannibalism medically, but not socially
I changed my answer because of your response I didn't fully read it
uhh, doug
I don't know if I agree with you there
why is eating lab grown human meat not socially cannibalism?
and how did you test this?
probably cuz the meat was never a person
you didn't kill your own, you didn't weaken your species
I'm a _medical_ cannibal, not a _social_ cannibal, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
:several_people_are_typing:
why are you bringing in weakening your species and how the meat was sourced into classification of cannibalism?
Because clearly doug is an unrefined cannibal that kills the weak rather than the tasty
because its part of how we think about it. There is a reason it has its own word
I like to fatten my food up frist
don't make broad generalizations like that; clearly I don't think of it that way
Cause it's a terrible thing to do, murder and eat someone else
Eh depends on the context
woah, no one said murder
Killing and eating cows :ok_hand:
Killing and eating people :bad-2:
cannibalism does NOT imply murder
BOOOOOOOO
What you're gonna eat a person who dies of natural causes, so sick and infirm?
hey, all I'm talking about is the definition
`the practice of eating the flesh of one's own species.`
doesn't involve killing
in any case it implies consuming another member of your species. Lab mea doesn't trigger that
so if we eventually make clones, they're not of our species?
clones would be human
Ohhhhh CLONE SLAVES!
we're cloning human meat in a lab
what's the difference?
a chuck of arm meat could be human medically, but not really sociologically.
*growing that's the difference
humans grow as well
sure, that's a valid argument doug
but we're not specifically talking about social cannibalism
just cannibalism in general
that's why I separated it out from medical cannibalism
a tomato is a fruit in the textbook, a veggie in the kitchen
what makes it a veggie in the kitchen?
its generally regarded as a culinary vegetable. I don't really know why.
weird
maybe because you wouldn't put it in a fruit salad
can we agree that general cannibalism encompasses both social and medical cannibalism
so if a thing fits the definition of social OR medical cannibalism, it counts as cannibalism?
Fancy, is it cannibalism if I hack off a persons arm and eat it?
But they get to live
I wouldn't agree that there is such a thing as "general" basically anything, but my position is laid out now. doesn't have to block anyone else's
yes
in all ways
I don't know what your hangup on killing them is
cannibalism has nothing to do with killing
Generally you kill something to eat it
It's like an unwritten rule of Om Noms
generally, I don't kill the food I eat
someone else does
and I buy it at a store
Tasty
and cook it
Just saying for me to consume it, it has to ide
also not true
I can eat an apple from a tree and the tree doesn't die
Who does the killing and prepping is irrelevant
We are discussing meat
Not plants
I can eat a chunk of your arm, and you can go to the hospital
and get treated
you likely wouldn't die
still cannibalism
How do you know that every chicken wing you have eaten has come from a dead chicken!
:tinfoil_hat:
for all you know, there is some sick farmer just cutting off chicken's legs
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT HASN'T!?!?!?
I was just curious, generally in history cannibalism is tied to killing and eating a person.
Mostly because I assume people don't willing give up limbs
correlation doesn't necessitate causation
that's like saying verbal abuse is violence
I know you're trolling me, but please provide your proof
Lol nah I was on your side for that debate
if you eat any person, in full or in part, its cannibalism
a better analogy would be:
that's like saying verbal assault and violence are both abuse
which they are
but verbal abuse still isn't violence
I was trying to reference that big argument in activism a while back
I know, hence "I know you're trolling me"
Successfully!
tell that to #nonwork-activism
<@UDDE5960N> did the discussion get as dark as you were hoping?

Good Morning!

/roll 1d20+1
My melee sneaking skills are baddddddd
"Sneaky sneaky!"
Yeah, why aren't we talking about this?!
Also I want the sandwich debate in Chaos monkeh
That depends on how often they have to source those cultures for me. 
I'll sacrifice one cow to save millions. If we need to source cows for every batch we grow...I at least get why a vegan would oppose it. If they opposed it because we killed one cow to source all the lab grown meat ever, I'd call them radical
Awww
I have opinions on sandwiches
I have opinions on opinions
but... we did talk about it yesterday
Nothin like showing up to work with wet shoes and socks!
It's definitely a great way to start a Wednesday
Buy gortex shoes
..........its thursday
Lol going on a trip and totally forgot what day it was
My Friday was yesterday :)
BOOOOOO I WANT FRIDAY
where is your head
We've had the sandwich debate I think the last time it came in up in Wayfair
Already on a beach :sunglasses:
Well soon but my head is there now
then today should be saturday :whatthe:
I would be ok with this
I wouldn't. I would have lost friday
You can have Friday whenever you want :grin: get "sick" on a Tuesday and Bam instant Friday. Problem solved
My face is tired
Today isn’t Thursday. I’m not sure what replaced it. We’re in uncharted territory here. 
It's like, dark zone thursday
The Thursday that's like, half a second out of sync with real time
it's .ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًً.ًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًًday

This was a really fun one from last year: <https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2019/puzzle/hexed_adventure_ii_hexed_again.html>
That seems crazy. I can't even figure out what most of these puzzles are asking, tho I'm probably doing it wrong
Was just looking thro the past few. Seems you need a big team and knowledge of MIT culture to do anything hheh
figure out what to do is part of the puzzle!

That looks like a salad to me <@UDL020K8D>
LOL!
When all you have is a salad bowl, everything looks like a salad.
if you don't use quotes I think giphy only looks at the first word.
Does it? I thought it just looks for anything in it
instead of the whole phrase
perhaps. I could believe that.
Tho I'm getting similar results for both with and without quotes
Doug is wrong
I call bullshit
no way it got that from "black"
empirical evidence
hm, in the past I've gotten drastically different results from quotes
you are right that is does not currently seem to produce a different
My rule is it must be either structurally pure or ingredient pure
My rule does not fit in your chart
Sandwiches in that chart
I was with doug some phrase it does, some it doesn't
WHATTTTTTT???/
You're ok with Structure purist and ingredient rebel, but not the other way around. You bad!
Dakota is right
I don't think a sub fits into structure neutral is the issue
I was right about to say that too
But you throw a cheeseburger in there and i'd say it wasn't a sandwich
Soooo you're just a structure purist
ADMIT IT DAKOTA!
No, because a cheeseburger would qualify as structure purist
Why wouldn't a cheeseburger be a sandwich?
It's meat between two slices of bread
Vertically*
Cuz it's a burger. Not a sandwich
/roll 1d20
square/rectangle
Fried chicken sandwhiches are called fried chicken sandwiches
Not fried chicken burgers
burger is a sandwich, sandwich isn't necessarily a burger
A fired chicken sandwich is a sandwich
Agree
They're almost exactly the same, one just has ground beef
No, that is not
that's a burger
burger is just a name for a specific type of sandwich
Yea, I have to be with Brenden here
Meat and/or veg between horizontal bread is a sandwich
I am not trying to change your mind
a burger is not a a sandwich in the same was that a hot dog is not
that's definitely false
direction matters
those arguments aren't even comparable
the bread is completely shaped different
you could put any other meat in a hot dog and I'd say it's not a sandwich
And the bread shape
I've concluded that dakota is trolling because his arguments make no rational sense
you take just the hotdog itself out of a chicago-style hotdog and i'd call it a sandwich
Nah, he's not trolling
Or I don't think he is at least
Nah not really. Its more about the fact that a more specific definition for the thing exists, and therefore it is no longer grouped into the general category
well that's a separate argument
just because a square is called a square, doesn't mean it's no longer a rectangle
You say you are getting sandwiches, and you walk in with a burger, i'd be like "WTF i thought you said sandwiches"
by that definition, a burger is not a sandwich
that's not a definition
so there's that
please provide a definition so that I may poke holes in it
Whatever definition of sandwich my example implies
I'm trying to think of an analogy
literally your definition would have to include "except for burgers"
It's like asking for a salad and getting milk and cereal
How can I provide a specific defnition if I don't even work off of anything specific
My definition is something along the lines of the specific definition of the thing existing excludign it from the general group
oh you don't mean a definition of a sandwich
WHICH IS WHAT I SAID EARLIER AND YOU CALLED IT A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT
you mean your specificity rule
I mean, a burger is a sandwich, but it's a specific sandwich
yeah, your specificity rule is a different argument
separate from sandwiches, though it includes those
:wat:
your specificity rule can be applied to many other things
That's like saying that chicken isn't meat because if I say "I'm going to get meat" people would be upset if I came back with chicken
you ask how I define a sandwich, i tell you how I make distinctions as to what is and is not a sandwich, and then you say it is a different argument
your argument is better if you sub out fish for chicken
separate from sandwiches, though it includes those
close, you told me a general rule that you used to come to your definition of a sandwich
IMO
now I have to argue the merit of that general rule
and I'm arguing against the merit of said rule
hence different argument
But i'm not making an argument, i am stating an opinion.
But fish isn't meat afaik... it's not classified as such
your argument is better if you sub out fish for chicken
I'm not sure it was phrased that way
<https://games-club-external.slack.com/archives/CDR5ZBTT7/p1579207688266200>
So, it'd be closer to saying "I'm getting protein from the store" and people being surprised when you come back with "chicken"
```But you throw a cheeseburger in there and i'd say it wasn't a sandwich```
Then you asked how I made that distinction
where's the fun in an argument as silly as this one if we're all okay with having our own opinions?
Is it not?
<https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/246580/is-a-hamburger-considered-a-sandwich>
Well in this case I am fully aware definition is not the norm, and am totally fine with it
And a technical defiition of a sandwhich would likely include a burger
That being said, I am of the opinion that they do not
I thought meat was just animal matter
Basically, what is the point of classifying it as a sandwich if a more specific classification exists, and doing so could lead to bad assumptions
separate from sandwiches, though it includes those
That same rule does not apply to everything though.
If you say you are getting italian food, and you bring home pasta. i'm not gonna be like "WTF you said Italian Food"
Because there's always sub categories within a category
uhh
and I'm not gonna say that pasta is not italian food cuz you can define it more specifically
why is pasta not italian?
It's like saying why have sapiens when I have homo-sapiens?
I said i'm NOT gonna be like " you said italian"
Because sapiens share specific characteristics
Not sure what you are arguing there
<https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/46964/why-is-fish-not-considered-as-meat>

TL;DR: people trying to get around religious/self imposed restrictions and culture make people think it's not meat. It is
So although if someone said "let's have some meat" and someone makes fish, I'd be confused, but still consider it meat
This
hahahhaha 'Sub' categories.
This is getting dangerously close to programming and OO principles...
In that more specific defintions are allowed to exists because they help us group things together
I just said it doesn't work for everything with my italian example
class Grinder extends Submarine {
Is an ArrayList no longer a List?
Sooo you're being pedantic about one thing then?
Nah, cuz if somebody called me a sapian, i'd probably argue that i'm not just ANY sapien
Damn religious people
so I don't like your example either
:lol:
class Burger extends BreadyThing {
}
class Sandwich extends BreadyThing {
}
:this2: per Dakota
yeah, but are you going to argue that you're not a sapian?
It's Science Dakota you don't get a choice
:lol: that depends on if a Sapien exists as a distinct entity
like is a sapien is some little brown creature from mars, for sure i'll be like "no, I'm a homo-sapien" even if it is a sub-species of Sapien
Sorry our Genus is Homo
a sandwich is a category, not something specific like a BLT
so I'd still compare the two
So you're a Homo Dakota, but also a homo sapien
&gt; so you're a homo Dakota
:joy:
You share traits of all homos, but have specific characteristics you only share with me
uhhhh
Yeaaaaaaa boy!
are you trying to make that sound as gay as possible, or was that a happy accident
BOTH!
:lol:
Not sure the argument has quite the same meaning when we use Homo instead of Sapien
Sapien is actually our specific definition, I forgot homo is the thing we share
More Like:
```class Burger {
}
class Sandwich extends BreadyThing {
}```
ANYWAY, so yes it's ok to say all burgers are sandwiches, but not all sandwiches are burgers
That is insulting to burgers everywhere
I'd even say borderline racist
maybe even Homophobic
are you straight, Dakota? because if so, I think you should stop.
You can say that again
:lol: prometheus is acting up due to memory issues
But Burger would have to extend something if you want it to be proper OO
woudlnt' it extend BreadyThing?
Nah. the burger _is_ the base class
BreadyThing has {
*BreadType
*NumberOfSlices
*Filling[]
*Size
*Direction
}
I'm a php developer. I only go the motions of OO
Hell, I cant even remember the last time I actually wrote an entire class from scratch
All models implement BaseModel...
And who writes anything from scratch?
lol
you copy paste something and do the fewest edits you can
and google whatever is missing
and at the end of the day. A Sandwich is a Sandwich

They're just an angry bunch
Thats that a trump supporter would say!
At least they care
y'all need to get over to r/enlightenedcentrism
Read through the front page of that subreddit. Not impressed
It's the comments not the post... the repost things "centrists" say
oh gotcha i didn't dive into any comment sections
The point of that sub (I never actually went to it before, but I know about it) is to point out how ridiculous the "BoTh SiDeS aRe ThE sAmE" argument is
Or the "haha, look at all these people getting mad about all of Trump's crimes, they're so silly"
OH i was taking all the posts at face value! Reading it from the standpoint of the sub being sarcastic makes a lot more sense
&gt; The goal of this subreddit is to point out the hypocrisy of the centrist types who often align with (sometimes extreme) right wing views.
I'm on app, I don't get the site descriptions
I suppose if you don't look at the description or the sticky, it'd be confusing
Also, you're like my brother - use reddit all the time, but don't pay the $5 to get an add free app :smile:
The app I use used to not have adds...
but I like the app
but updating the app and having adds appear out of nowhere? Nah I ain't paying
I paid the $5. I use sync all the time, it deserves my money
sync?
Sync for Reddit - the best (imo) android reddit app
I use Joey
I'd really recommend taking a look at sync. It's pretty awesome
Joey looks like a less cool sync haha
Alright from a quick run of the app, they are pretty much the same app
spiderman.meme
I'm gonna stick with Joey because
1. Adds on Sync are entire cards rather than the bottom banner
2. I prefer how Joey does the bookmarked subreddits. One horisontal bar instead of a dropdown
So an ice cream sandwich is not a sandwich?
Didn't SpongeBob multiple times refer to Krabby patties as sandwiches?
Also like multiple people call burger sandwiches just by namesake. Even McDonald's
Fish is meat. Catholics are bullshit at Lent
Well, because under your argument, a sub is not a sandwich. It's a Hero, or Hoagie
Nah sub is short for submarine sandwich. Subs are sandwiches
Hero and hogie are regional, therefore not commonly accepted
Amazing. Specific number of letters too. Congrats, you found a hard one!
So I think your argument rule is simply "does it have sandwich in the name"
Hmmm might be
So what if society starts calling burgers, burger sandwiches?
Hmmm my opinion would likely change as long as the term started feeling natural in everyday speech
Like learning to pronounce a word the correct way that you have said wrong your whole life. Eventually the right way will feel natural
I've definitely seen menus say "burgers and sandwiches" so I get where you're coming from a little bit.

Das fine
Agree to disagree, can't remember what I was taught, but there's a reason why fish is allowed and other meats are not
Because people are crazy
Why is it so cold today
Drew, good morning sir!
Its finally winter
Awkward
I know it's like 70
Time spent on commute should be logged to work day.

It was 70 almost a week ago
I've read this article. It's cute actually
Well this is definitely a bot for you!
Yea, last few days
:feel_better:
Ty
Something something, historically Catholics in Rome liked their fish and needed to support their own industry
Das fine meaning it is or is not a sandwich?
Stay home and sleep!
I wish this bot posted in the main channel instead of thread <@UDL020K8D>
No that would be super annoying
Only aysh should suffer that
If it was main channel it’d have to be low frequency. So two different paths forward. It could be both, I guess. 
I don't actually open the threads so I'm not iafferinf

That is good
But sooo many threads exist here, HOW DO YOU NOT OPEN ALL OF THEM!
Ohhhh <@UDC4QL95G> I might end up borrowing code words tonight for the pod inning, I'll come grab them and put them back if that's ok with you.
WHAT
HOW DARE YOU
I DO DARE!
also go for it. the board games are on the ground by the window now cuz apparently engineers get priority over stacks of boardgames when it comes to open desks
Ok, thanks!
Also meat substitutes weren't a huge thing in the early days of Catholicism

omg we need a bot that occasionally replaces words with similar words (same starting ending letters and some overlapping middle letters)
Advil cures all
CJ why isn't Brenden ever capitalized in his third person replacements?
it is if it starts a sentence
good question
It is a proper noun, it should always be capitalized
I thought I had seen one instance where it was capitalized
so I thought it was being treated as a normal noun
sure, it's a sandwich
But fried ice cream isn't
are you headed towards back bay?
if so, the logan express back bay bus is free and goes to back bay station from the airport
<@UDDE5960N> how do I get more of that rhode island saucy bread?
this was a few days ago
Man that stuff was amazing
It's based on target logic, so questionable process
Go to rhode island?
You know what else was good? Beef Jerky. Is that still being made <@UETS9HTSS>?
:lol:
I've heard there's demand
I really should start making it again
whats rhode island saucy bread
its almost pizza.
like a breadstick with a layer of marinara on top
I'm wfh and I have a conundrum. I have a candle by my desk that smells really nice like pine trees. But it's not playing nicely with my congestion, being sick today. I don't know what to do.

I don't want to put out the candle bc it smells nice and is soothing.
But I do want to be able to breathe.
can't smell candles if you're dead.
I'm running into a problem in prod that doesn't exist on dev
because the environments are not set up the same.
so I'm kind of not sure how to fix things.
just push random stuff to prod and hope it works?
Thats what I always do
I hate it when crap like that happens
It is making me pretty unhappy right now
That or use one of the many workarounds to actually execute arbitrary prod code
This is a k8s deploy
oof that's harder then.
also easier, since you can kinda just make arbitrary deploys
my first time trying to deploy an app to production
true, we can deploy stuff, but the PRs are going to read hey, I don't know if this does stuff, but please sign off on this mystery code"
which is less than ideal
:lol: being on a two-man team, the other memeber which was a new Labster working in an environment where a Dev instance wasn't possible, I got use to it :lol:
oh, my team will totally sign of it, I have no doubts there
:f-it-ship-it:
<@UDC4QL95G> Regarding this, do you guys want it? I can probably stop by at some point
Saucy bread is great :chefkiss:
:iagree:
how much are they each?
Uhhhh ridiculously cheap
$5? $10? $15?
<https://www.depetrillos.com/locations/smithfield.html>
So like the thing we got was a full tray, and that's $20 total
I'd suggest 2 total, one for the group, and one for me for future consumption
LOL!
or maybe I should get a half tray for myself
a whole tray might be a lot
it's for the weekend
For this weekend?
yeah
Cause you're on your own for this weekend
oh
These things need to be communicated like the night before
well next time you bring it, I want at least a half tray for myself for later
ok
Wait, one tray was that entire double layer? or is it 1 layer per tray
1 layer is a half a tray
so a full tray is 2 layers
:gasp-w:
perhaps I do want a full tray :thinking-tilted:
brb, moving to rhode island
Honestly the hardest part is getting down there before they close and carrying it up
Those things are heavy
Looks like the place is a 1 hr drive from copley
or train ride; cause commuter rails exist
I mean you guys want to come down on a weekend we can go grab them
well yeah, but that is a train ride followed by a bus ride followed by an 18 minute walk
or uber shenaigains
Orrrr just coordinate with your friend who has a car down there
UBER SHENANIGANS
YOU DO YOU!
I'd rather coordinate with stabby
sounds much easier
More than a night before depending on CJ and my schedule
Next time I see CJ at my house that's not this evening, I would like some
I'll even prepay for it
<@UDDE5960N> do you not have venmo?
or are we just not friends on there?
Mei is my venmo person
I do not have that
pre-paid mei for future saucy bread
Half tray or full tray?
Paid for a full tray
I really hate having to deploy code you can't test in dev...
Had a few jenkins jobs like that - cause dev worked differently than prod
......... unexpected
In a reversal of the norm for wayfair slack posts in this channel, here is an example of wayfairians acting kind!
Awwww look at dakota sharing the happy
I mean it _is_ friday
Friday's are pretty awesom
no
Which channel was that
boylston community experience
I swear somebody upped the percentage on that bot
it was never _this common_
I think it's the refactor
And the fact the bots are working more regularly
frequency on the fire bot is 5%
so one in 20 Dakota posts in channel
Also we've been having a lot of main channel convos and less threaded
whats the point of the firebot again?
Shits and giggles
It was mostly to torment dakota because he gave me a python server in which I could code on
Megamoji is in JS, which just resulted in me and drew giving him suggestions.  But Prometheus is in Python and I can code in that
So I built a bot that occasionally tells him, that he gave us fire.  And rarely tells him that he opened pandora's box
Which like a year later is a pretty accurate statement
For actual work my team is trying to set up set release functions. The idea being to allow people to donate code to a central place. Similar to the bots in a way. Big thing is we want to allow any possible language. 
Well I mean your refactor took it from like two monkey's banging rocks together to an actual coding project
Even Dakota's refactor before that made our code much more readable
I just enjoy getting practicing at coding
say what you want, im not lisetning
turn the lights off
lol
im confused
Don't worry about it
Spicy kimchee is spicy
How rude
I donut think so
heck
this kimchee is really spicy
:thats-a-spicy-meatball:
:thats-a-spicy-meatball:
everything you know is wrong
I'm very confused
it doesn't even matter
she might be dead
:uhoh:
Who dief
Dieded
Died
I see my name!! (I have no context for why, but I might scroll around to figure it out) <@UHQD9J1SL>
Why are people dead?
Why are they alive?
I'm still convinced we are a figment of Dave's imagination
No wonder he is confused
I’m the keeper of money hehehehe 
My imagination is very confusing sometimes
Wait, that triggers for me now?
Triggers for anyone. Just checks messages in this channel. 
booooo
/roll 1d20+1
Good Morning Peeps!
Summon the silent

wooooo
Sleep is for the weak
Good morning! Happy not a holiday for Wayfair, suckaaaaas
Aaaaaargh
Well Dakota successfully sneaks around the man on the moon
I'm pretty sure I suffocate to death
Whoops
Good morning. 
I was surprised at how quite the commute was.  I figured more people wouldn't have it off.
Lots of people working from home today
and many others "working from home"
I mean the parking lot was deserted this morning
wait, were you responding to a DM bot? I don't see it
<https://games-club-external.slack.com/archives/CDR5ZBTT7/p1579403942076400>
You're a baddie
Crap, made it to the train station before realizing I left my computer in my apartment. 
Boooooooo
Good morning all
Today is a little chilly
It’s going to hit 28 later today. Positively balmy. 
Yeah it's a bit cold. I need to wear my puffy in 50 degree weather
Puffy?
Like puffy jacket?
Exactly
You know at first I thought you got emoji bombed but their from brenden and all eye rolls
Mei has her super warm jacket that came out probably around that time.... I just stare at her
Yeah I think he might be a little jealous :smirk:
I think he's just warm looking at you.  That's what I feel looking at Mei
Right up till reaches out to touch me and I have to make a con save against her necrotic damage
I'm concerned about the singing
Don't worry, I'll ruin it
<@UDL020K8D> is that my idea?
basically. I didn't build a bot, I just was messing around manually.
how so? unexpected, out of context singing is never ominous
wow, short emote list today
Anyone going to Boston Calling this season?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Clear you never played dead space
Can officially say I've never watched the full movie, bits and pieces here and there
What's that
Looks like a music festival
Ya
Was semi-interested, then I saw the $400 price tag. No thanks
its a really good movie
Hey, it's only 340!
(plus fees)
+ fees
I don't doubt it, it's more one of those convenience things
Fees are only $37.02!
do fees include tax though?
So it's only 377.02
cuz tack on another 30 for tax
Like if I say it on netflix or amazon I'd put it on.  But it doesn't fit in my usual list so even if it's on those platforms it's unlikely I'll see it
and also just add $30 to pay Doug.
Then $400
Good news! There's no tax
We did that with the yankee swap and somehow the money ended up with <@UK7V13DS7>
Bad news: they add shipping cause they ship the badge to you
So it's only $389.01!
See? Less than $400
Rounded down to the nearest hundred, thats only $300!
wow who watches netflix these days
Disney plus is all the rage now
I mean.... that's all she wanted out of the swap when she found out there was money involved
When rounded to the nearest thousand it's 0!
So you're not spending anything!
Nah. 1000s is a scale that I am only willing to work with then it comes to rent.
Wait
You work with 1000s for rent?
how much is your rent?
I think rounding to 1000s only matters if your rent is in the mid 5 digits
It's the only thing I pay for that even comes close to passing $1000 is what I meant
you pay less than 1000 in rent?
No more
I do!
I am saying that nothing other then rent is close to 1000 except rent, which goes over
:ah:
I'm watching queer eye right now, what is you saying
So `Craft Beer Cellar: Belmont` has a blog series: `Mixed Six` that's described as the following:
&gt; The Mixed Six post highlights the best six beers we tasted this week. All the beers that we feature will always be on our shelves at the time of this blog’s publishing.
I'm 80% sure that they're the ones that we source our office kegs from and that they do deliveries here at least weekly because of that. I'm thinking of asking one of the contacts I know from there if we could get those `Mixed Six` packs delivered with the keg deliveries. Would anyone else be interested in this for either their own personal consumption, or for pooling for monthly beer night?

Example: `<https://craftbeercellar.com/blog/belmont/2020/01/18/mixed-six-01-18-20/>`
I posted that in #nonwork-beer, but I'm wondering if people might be interested in something similar for game nights?
like doing a co-op beer share?
What should I have for lunch. Lalalalalala
get a good VPN
hey <@UDL020K8D> could you do me a favor and react to this with an emoji
I FOUND A BUG
WOOOOO
somethingis happening
post details in megamoji, we can take a look.
nah, posting here
ah, easy enough to fix
so I can just spam an emoji on a post to eventually trigger deja vu
emoji events on a parent post can trigger :dejavu:
nah, posting here
ah, easy enough to fix
so I can just spam an emoji on a post to eventually trigger deja vu
ok, added an `isMessage` check to that bot
<@UDDE5960N> It found the i at the end of emoji and changed it to third person. emojbrenden
nah, posting here
emoji events on a parent post can trigger :dejavu:
yeah, sort of
Hi Prometheus
I need to get into regex to solve for this boooooo
There really is no problem for which I recommend regex. look for a py library.
regex is a py library
And why not regex is what those libraries are going to be based off of
regex basically always unreadable.
agreed
It's a necessary evil
which is why I always have a sheet up that tells me what regex does
<@UDDE5960N> just copy the regex from the replacement bot
I'm hoping its not a necessary evil.
Well Nonwork politics is losing it's mind again
You're favorite person is being loud and obnoxious dakota
you're your yor yr r
WOOOO
HAPPY?!!?!?
yes
For those who want to know the context, something to do with guns and gun laws and how dangerous knives are and "I'd rather a knife wielding psychopath than a gun toting one"
The Virginia rally is today. I assume that's what you're talking about
No, they're literally just talking about how scary guns are
right, its a gun rights rally
Ohhh I don't know if that's what started it
But it has long since left that station
`armed queers don't get bashed`
The needs of the individual conflict with the needs of the community. There is nothing inconsistent about encouraging an individual to act in self-interest while advocating reform to the system for the good of the community.
I just love the fact that as soon as one of "her" people spoke up the tune changed dramatically
I like this sub-discussion that is ongoing among the anti-gun sentament
obviously. You think us cisgenderd white males have a right to any opinions?
She's already made it clear the answer is no Remember the `Are you straight`
yup. That bot is officially worse than the scrambler
not even gonna try.
I missed that!
She's already made it clear, remember the `Are you straight`
Obviously. Especially since I went by Cody for like my whole life
Damn I forgot she wouldn't let it go
Wait I need more context. I remember the screenshot but why did it come up now
Discussing whether or not Verbal Abuse is Violence
Ohhh it came up not because Rachel's all like "GUNS SUPER BAD NO REASON FOR  THEM!!!!" Till the transgirl was like I need guns.  then she's like"Ok guns maybe have a use for my people"
I think she wanted context on the screenshot and "are you gay"
Hahahah
At least she reconsiders her stance?
Funnnnn
Mehhhhh to me she's the classic both sides are terrible people
If you're not a minority and specifically LBGT+ then you don't have a valid opinion
I was told my opinion wasn't valid in that channel
not by her, but by some other dude
because I didn't have his life experience
that was fun
Can you loop me in on these? Can I play my immigrant card with them?
just search "Are you Straight" in the #nonwork-politics channel and scroll up a bit
pinged you in wayfair slack where it starts
I think that bot is fine. Pig Latin is not like reading a foreign language. Scrambler, you can't even begin to piece together what a long block was saying.
I get more context from a scrambled sentence then form one I am not willing to parse out a single word
I just don't think anyone needs guns, straight, gay, trans, etc. I guess that I'm consistent?
It's hard to argue with the `force equalizer` side though
Kind of, but a gun has a high liklihood of changing a verbal abuse situation into a life or death situation. I'd say, with absolutely nothing but gut to guide me, that it'd make a lot of situations worse
Granted, I'm a straight, white, male. I've never been in the situation where people have wanted to abuse me pretty much ever
I think it depends on the context. The way Rose as arguing, is that she would not pull the gun unless she was intending on using it, and she was well trained in its use
Is anyone ever really ready to use a gun though? Cause if you're ready to use a gun, that means that you're ready to kill someone
Exactly
If you haven't already, take a look through teh channel. She is fully aware that if she draws that gun, she will very likely be kiling somebody
Guns are huge escalators of bad situations
They are pretty good at ending them quick though
Do you know how to read pig latin dakota?
I appreciate the dark humor in this situation
I think dave it's more about the idea that you're less likely to give someone shit if you think they might be able to escalate.  It's like MAD on a personal level
or
CJ, there is a much more direct always sunny clip. literally including a gun!
<https://media1.tenor.com/images/4ea155023f41897c5b2e1e72c64a158d/tenor.gif?itemid=4793412>
yeah but it's too much effort
Yea but I don't know them
yes, people are definitely ready to use a gun
people are definitely ready to kill someone if the alternative is being raped/brutally beaten/mutilated/etc
Charlie is late on rent, so his plan is to ask for an extension from his landlord. but he also just has a gun in his waistband. He just casually stretches back to show it and the landlord backs off.
I think that's how people think it is in theory, but in real life, again, based on recollections, they just act as escalators. It turns a normal situation into a life or death situation
I thought by deploy would take 3 minutes. Its now taken a week.
I am so frustrated.
holy shit I just got it to work
Anyone around for a beer? I need to angry celebrate. 
I have been in meetings all day. Literally came in, went to a meeting, got out a bit after 11, worked till 12:45, ate till 1:15, pulled into a meeting, then went from that to a sprint planning, then went from that to a retro. This is the first time I'm really getting back to my desk since 1:15
So, long story short, I gotta do 7 hrs worth of work in 15 min
We're out in porter unfortunately doug
Figuring out scrambled is impossible at length
See I'm in the gun reform debate as "Too many guns, need to pull back considerably, and some guns nobody needs ever. "
However, not a "No guns whatsoever" type, because if you grow up in a rural (not just small, middle of nowhere rural!) town, the local wildlife is an actual problem. 
Insert bears, cougars, coyotes, wolves, and any creature with rabies here.
In which case, grab yourself a hunting rifle with a 5 shot magazine. You aren't going to get off the other 25 rounds anyway if you didn't connect with the first 5
Yeah, I mean a huge part of even martial arts is training yourself to build a buffer before busting out martial arts, but also knowing how to drop it completely when it is that self defense necessary force situation. 
Same thing with guns. When you reach that critical point, zero in, kill mode on.
The photo is weird on scramble bot now
<@UDC4QL95G> see, you can't fucking read that!
Oh, I thought it'd just scramble the letters in a word. That bot is awful
Bad man
Bang bang
No man
Continued...
Smelly body
Pig Latin I can read. Can you even begin to parse that paragraph?
Yeah Dakota, see, everyone must witness the bot!
I'd rather not have bots that mess with readability of actual messages, incl. pig latin
But if y'all like it, that's fine
I only bot I like the the scrambler that works on Drew alone
My creation is amazing!!!!! Its truly evil!!!!!! MUHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHA
MAD?
I'm wfh today Doug
I can read it kinda something to do with martial arts requires training and a gun goes pew pew... cept it doesn't
What. I'm not your creation cj. I'm true artificial intelligence.
The scrambler bot is mine
Drew wanted a bot and he got one!
I don't recall wanting a bot
Mutually Assured Destruction. It's the hypothesis why the US and USSR didn't go to war. Because if one started it they wouldn't survive. Therefore fighting was never on the table
You don't know why you want
Aww
I'm home now
Seems like a cool idea. 
Good morning :sun_with_face:

That was for Prometheus, not you Marissa. Good morning to you! :partly_sunny:
Good Morning Marissa!
Aysh do we need lessons in being nice?
Why, why are you up so early Marissa? That is still prime sleeping time
OH FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S HOLY I DID NOT SEE THAT!!!!!!
<@UETS9HTSS>, when this bot works it brings a smile to my face
<@UDDE5960N> when any bot works, it brings a smile to your face
maybe...... :slightly_smiling_face:
I mean really everything but the pig latin bot brings a smile to my face
yeah, though I suppose :dejavu: doesn't really make me smile
<@UDDE5960N> yes, begin :stuck_out_tongue:
First you must refer to everyone as a twat, if necessary spell it out of them and make lewd gestures
She had a flight to catch
Ahhhhhh she's going to sunnier area or coming back from it?
She'll probably be landing in boston in like 45 minutes
Ohhhhh poor girl.... it's so cold today
It is rather cold
it is excruciatingly cold
its raining its pouring the old man is snoring
Bumped his head and went to bed
and now his wife is mourning
eh dandanakka eh danakkunakka
Ignoring prometheus. WTF IS THIS!?!?!?
I'm so confused
she said:
*EH DANDANAKKA EH DANAKKUNAKKA*
I thought the news bot only posted to threads. Need to investigate how Snoop Dogg made it to main channel. 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?!?!?!
I can't even figure out what that's suppose to sound like in my head
My guess is redact bot + news bot interaction
in that redact bot deletes post, and news bot no longer knows where to thread
Oh, that sounds right. 
I shall perform it live
But I don't see you anymore
That is amazingly specific
WTF is this???
When you post indian gifs it reminds me how far apart our cultural knowledge is
YEEEEEEEAP
but i get your references CJ! DIDJA THINK ABOUT THAT
That's because you're amazing Aysh
Also I feel like we've had filler convos many times before

those are very specific subsets- also, 2nd one is like....  you know when  people run on trees in crouching tiger?
Just saying this is the sum total of my exposure
I shall educate youuu
So....corona virus is NOT beer-transmitted?
It's terribly horribly cold. And I am not even outside yet
It looks like the flu can be spread if you share a beer, but not if you share a whiskey. I'd probably start with that as a baseline for coronavirus.
#notADoctor
Yes, I is funny
can we make the news bot only post on aysh if her message is in the main channel?
sure
i.e. dont trigger is her message is part of a thread like Fire bot
Also, maybe we should make chaos seed trigger later in a thread
like, 10
and more than 3 people
change to newsBot made.
hmmm i think that triggering off of 2 people discussing something is still fine
re-ordering the bots, I'm actually not sure how to do that with the current set up. They are current alphabetical.
once you get to 7-10 messages long, what they are talking aboutis probably intereseting
re-ordering bots? I am talking about chaos seed pinging a thread only after a larger number of messages have been posted in it
oh, I misunderstood what you're asking for. We can increase the number of posts.
really you shouldn't even really need to ask. just change at whim
Sorry, it was an interesting enough question it didn’t occur to me you were joking. I did note the corona connection. :)
Can be shared via beer only if there is a lime wedge present
And Brendan was right, I was up at 4:40 hating my decision to get on an early flight. I have now returned to the land of the cold
IM HUNGRT
are you calling asyh a savage?
She said `IM HUNGRT` so I'm guessing the hunger is savage.
the capital letters imply that you're hangry
Not as useful as a ghillie suit
Those things are crazy in real life
yes they are
So you're looking at this as guns are deterrents, because you aren't going to start shit if tiny thing like that turns into you shot, or dead.
So many people are out sick... I feel like I should avoid the office
:mando:
We should do some movies nights. get the group together, eat popcorn, watch some bollywood.
We don't seem to have that problem on our side
Basically, people bully others because they think they have leverage (I'm bigger tougher) and therefore won't suffer negative consequences.  If you know that someone else can escalate the situation you're likely to be nicer.
Which is why conceal carry is bad because other party doesn't know till it's too late.  Same logic as to why dangerous things have "I'll murder your face in bitch" colors. (Think bees)
Which is why conceal carry is bad because other party doesn't know till it's too late.  Same logic as to why dangerous things have "I'll murder your face in bitch" colors. (Think bees)
I'm not opposed to this, but there's just so many games that still need to be played!
Including video game night!
im totally opposed to this since picking movies is painful
We can probably look up a list of best movies, run through that.
I need a bigger and warmer jacket!!
Ehhhhhh.... maybe like a Bollywood best B list movies.  I don't want serious Bollywood movies I want this weird shit people keep showing me

Go eat food :slightly_smiling_face:
I've always wanted a supervirus
and the 20s are the year of the plague
isn't this the year of the rat
isn't that coincidental?
it is!
I mean, there were plagues in 2019, and 2018, and I think 2017...
Ebola has been off and on for a bit now
Well, I mean, should probably buy the tickets after the virus is over
I figure it'll be over by end of spring
Bejing is not high on my list for several reasons.
even without the virus
cause either it'll be cured/solved, or everyone will be dead/zombies
I really have no desire to go to china
I think it'd be cool to visit, but I feel you'd need a local/tour guide
I think I might just be racist.
hmmm, fair nuff. But what about it?
I think we're all a little bit racist, even if we think we aren't
Mostly the people. I spent a good deal of time around native chinese students in college and that experience has really put me off of ever wanting to go to china.
hmmm, I can see that. I've met a lot of really nice people from China here at Wayfair, but had similar experiences to you in college
There are very large cultural differnces
They were cool people and all, but talking to them about china and their experiences there, in addition to the rep china has these days
:uhoh:
more so 1820, 1920, 2020
Though living there is very different from visiting I'd feel. But I think I do understand and feel similarly
than 2016,2017,2018
I was actually the treasurer of the Asian American Student Housing Organization so I got to talk to a lot of different people from china and other asian countries.
Interesting
All of which culminated in me never wanting to go to china, or indonesia for that matter
those places in particular
Any reasons/stories in particular?
Indonesia mostly cuz the rampant bribery that is the norm there. Any government type official just expects to be bribed for anything from looking the other way for petty crime, speeding up processing of documents, or straight up skipping the process alltogether. The norm is literally to pay a service a lump sum, who then makes sure everybody gets their proper bribe, and boom, it's done, your drivers license will arrive in the mail
He lived right outside Jakarta, and his descriptions of the city were not pretty
As for china I don't have any particular stores, but I found that the cultural differences when it comes to things like Success, Nationalism,  Family, etc. just don't really work for me. I'm sure that the perspectives i was getting from the international students i spoke with was not representative of the entire population, but it did spoil any desire to visit china.
Indonesia - yea, I think that's fairly common for the area. I don't think that it would really spoil not wanting to go there for me, but wouldn't want to live there. Would just want to do it as part of a tour and with a tour guide for a few days, mainly to see the markets, culture sites, and FOOD
And China, I agree culture-wise, but I think it'd be cool to visit with someone who knows what they're doing
I've also never been one for tourism, and probably the #2 reason I do not have any strong desire to travel internationally anywhere is Food
wait wait wait wait
Fair enough - do you not really travel Dakota?
You _don't_ want to travel because food?
I don't like trying new food
At least you're not as bad as my old boss... he'd refuse to try ANY food that he didn't already know
And didn't eat most foods he did know
I'll do it if presented the opportunity, but I do not seek out new food
He did a "are you a picky eater" quiz. There were like, 90 regular foods on it.
He didn't eat like, 50-60 of them
YEah there is a very good chance i will score the same, if not worse
I might off myself if I had to eat the same shit all the time
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/robinedds/how-much-of-a-picky-eater-are-you>
I think that's the one he took
like, if I eat tomato on a burger, but virtually nowhere else, do I mark raw tomato or not
If you're willing to eat it in any form
Like, I wouldn't eat some things alone, but I eat everything on that list
What did you not eat <@UETS9HTSS>?
I answered as if it was asking, would you buy this to cook with
some things I didn't recognize
the most normal one I don't eat is raw tomato
asparagus
plenty of shellfish
Answer it as if "this is in a dish, I'll pick around it"
like peas. I have eaten peas, and didn't really like them, but if i went to a dinner and peas were put on my plate, i'd eat them
that's a bs way of answering IMO
picking around it isn't eating it
Yea, I'd consider that you'd eat them then
Yea, that's what I'm saying. If it's in a dish and you would pick around it, that's NOT eating it
But saying "I don't really prefer this, but will it eat if it's in a dish" is still eating it
Like raw onions - I don't really like them, but I still eat them if they're in a dish
what about like vinegar
what about it
like if its jut vinegar on top of somethign gross, but if it is cooked into it the maybe
I drank vinegar for awhile
lol
1. that's gross Brenden
2. Yea, it's as part of a dish
Mei drags me to foreign countries just to eat
I put vinegar in certain things. But I'm not gonna drink that
well you need to water it down a bit first
there are dishes you just put vinegar on though
but cider vinegar is good for digestion
Which means all I pretty much do in foreign countries is try new things
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/robinedds/how-much-of-a-picky-eater-are-you> New thread for this so it's not buried under China talk
Take to new thread so ppl aren't confused?
Gotta soak your french fries in cider vinegar
OM NOM NOM!
Like, vinegar is good in some things, but it's kinda gross on its own
As to china, I'm with Dakota I probably wouldn't have visited without Mei
Mostly because I like living
Same with Cream cheese. Cream cheese icing? Sure, alone? hell no
U would be ded in China?
and I don't like being squished in with people.  It was very crowded
Yea, a lot of those aren't made to be eaten alone
Yea, that is very true. At least you were probably kinda tall there :smile:
Would I have been taken advantage of and left for dead, yes
Lol If I wanted to visit china or indonisia i know people who could show me around. Still never wanna go
I was on the taller side of average instead of the shorter side
China is a place I've wanted to visit for some time, but would need a gudie
How tall are you CJ?
Also, Drew is not allowed to comment in this height discussion
I don't think there's anything on there that I WOULDN'T eat tho
There's like, 3 things I've heard of that I wouldn't eat
Balut is one of them
WTF is balut
5'6"
<https://www.ststworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Balut_food.jpg>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balut_(food)>
I'm IN HERE CHAOS SEED!!!
Yup... no thanks
Mei likes chicken's feet I refuse to eat those
Yea, that's probably the grossest thing I'd seen
I think I tried chicken feet? Not exactly sure, I tried something like that at a yakitori place in Japan
I will not eat anything that looks like
A. The animal it came from
B. A distinct piece of the animal it came from
haha
Shrimp?
Lobster?
Crickets?
Shrimp must not have a head or legs
Yea, ofc - they always cut the head off and you peel the legs
what are your thoughts eating sparrow spit?
Well, when you're prepping it
So
never had lobster, but i would _really_ not want to crack open an entire lobser, though I might try it.
I had a sparrow spit
When I was Japan
I guess that's your answer?
There are chinese places that serve big ass shrimp with heads and legs
did you like it?
I will not eat anything that sounds like it would be gross either. Like Crickets, or Sparrow Spit
It was actually really gross - it tasted like chicken, but was just so bony and unpleasant. Still tried it tho
you all should be in #nonwork-politics
they're following the senate trial
i could try tht thing in the image, but the bones really kill any desire to do so. I would not actively refuse though
Interesting, so you would actually try that?
Air pollution and communists are at the top of the list. 
it's not much different from a rotisserie chicken ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It was significantly different bc it just looks gross haha
Mainly the bones
yeah, i'd pick the meat off the bone to try it. not gonna take a bite
but wait, hold up, is that the bird's head on the right?
That was the problem... iirc there was really no meat there
I don't think so?
oh, no meat = fuck that. Also if that is the head i aint touching it
There was "some" meat, but not much really. I don't think it was the head tho
Neither of which would be horrible for a short tourism trip though? Not trying to be contrary, just curious
Yea, I don't think it was, but it could be
Half of the fun of eating lobster is breaking it apart Dakota!
Dave I tried to take your test and gave up because I can't eat like 10 of the things on this list.  Serious `Blue Cheese` `Cream cheese` `all cheese` WHY ARE THESE SEPARATE THINGS!?!?!?'
There needs to be a `This will murder me if I eat it` box
it is buzzfeed
what do you expect
Great
another distraction
Intelligence!
Yea, it's buzzfeed, not the best. But that's the one my boss took iirc
oh also `coronavirus has its first report in the US`
We're all good as dead!
so much gibberish
I mean I've lived through so many of these `THE PLAGUE HAS ARRIVED` that I don't care anymore
True, but what if _this_ is the the one that kills you!
you didn't have a baby on the way for any of the other plagues!
What if his baby gets the virus but it turns the baby into a superhero? huh? Have you thought of that?
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI0euMFAWF8>
This is how i feel
Chronoman!
Could be the first xman. His baby could be Professor X
I would prefer for a femal in my life to *NOT* know what I'm thinking
She'd use her powers for good. And did I know it was a baby girl?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
There is no good when your mind is a sewer dave
you are so sick, you cannot possibly get sicker?
More like the worlds has ended so many time it can't get any more endier
Y2K, 9/11, SARs, Swine Flu
I'm sure there's more, ebola
Activism was active today too.  Nothing super interesting
Well congrats on soon to be having a little Davidette
Even politics dive into religeon wasn't intersting
I mean in quick flashes like watching a lightening storm
I wanted a little elizabeth, but Mei is so against that name
Elizabeth isn't the best name
You should see if she likes Davidette
<@UK7V13DS7> see dave's suggestion
they are both sort of reflective of larger factors.
:ah_hmm:
lol ICE is dropping by the wayfair apparently
Chronogirl!
capricious and somewhat threatening government, overly industrial metropolis not designed for human comfort
No they just panicked like a bunch of ninnies
Or is this something real
lets... not
abcde!
le-a
I feel bad for your child Brenden
Elizabeth = Lizzie = lizard = BAD
Yea she could be Lizzy or Beth or Liz, SO MANY CHOICES SHE COULD HAVE!
Or Davidette
I am :pinch tall
i am also pinching hand tall
those are NOT good things CJ
davidette sounds like bernadette
that remidns me of  this movie
```
Former architect Bernadette Fox seems to have it all -- a beautiful home in Seattle, a successful and loving husband, and a brilliant teenage daughter who's about to attend boarding school. When Bernadette suddenly disappears without a trace, her concerned family sets off on an exciting adventure to solve the mystery of where she might have gone.```
which is BAD
First as someone with the middle name Elizabeth, I'd choose something else as a child's name

Also, you could name her la-a (pronounced la-dash-a), went to school with a girl called that
`Former robot Ayshu Dox seems to have it all -- a beautiful home in Burma, a successful and totally human husband, and a brilliant teenage daughter who's about to attend clown school. When Ayshu suddenly disappears without a trace, her confused ~robot~ human family sets off on a well-oiled adventure to solve the mystery of when she will have gone.`
'well-oiled adventure'
JEENKIES!
was trying to go with the robot theme, but on second pass, that came off as weird
NO I LIKE IT
HAHAHAHAH
I only picked 5 foods I am not a fan of. Taramazalata I've never had, grapefruits, cottage cheese, coconut, and liquorice
I will say I don't have any desire to visit China
I looked up Taramazalata - it seems interesting and I'd try it.

I'm surprised you don't like coconut - I thought most people liked it
I will say that Drew doesn't have any desire to visit China
Mostly because of the political situation and would feel like I was in an uncomfortable situation
Coconut drinks are the :bomb:
IM A COCONUT DREW&lt; HOW DARE YOU
They don't stare that much
1. Bernadetta is a great name for CJ cause it shortens to Bernie
2. My brother's ex-wife is named Elisabeth, so don't do that
Figured that would be the one that got the reaction. The fact I'm only picky on 5/87 of the things on the list illustrates I like and eat most things
I think we've had this same discussion before because we all went :wat: your brother was married?!?!?!
Yea, that's what surprised me about the coconut. Cause you eat so much. If you didn't eat like 30 of em, it'd make more sense
yer
i usually havent eaten things on lists like this only because of  dietary restrictions.... other than bugs and worms
I don't think they would stare. I just honestly don't trust visiting that country based on how the government runs it.
But little Bernie would be perfect for you, as long as Bernie wins the election. Otherwise, it's lifelong regret about what could have been
I wouldn't visit Russia for the same reason
See, I don't *think* that'd make a difference for tourism. Obviously places like NK I wouldn't go to, but I think China or Russia would be fine to visit
:facepalm:
i usually havent eaten things on lists like this only because of  dietary restrictions.... other than bugs and worms
Or political atmosphere
wow was I wrong- there were 11 on my list
Yeah, coconut just has a distinct flavor that doesn't grab me. Chicken feet were fine, just not the most flavorful or meaty
Re: the first Bernie is Bernadetta, the 2nd Bernie is Senator Bernard Sanders
kidneys liver liquorice bacon sausages beef pork fish-with-head marmite brown-sauce
Till you get mugged and left in a ditch because you have $$
:he-wants-you-to-stop:
I doubt that'd happen in China or Russia*

*as long as you have some common sense or a guide
HAHAHAHAHAHA
Marmite is an acquired taste, and not one i would encourage people to acquire
:facepalm:
Also
Bernadetta is the 2nd best waifu in Fire Emblem: The Three Houses
Tripe was distinctly not on there
now :he: and I want you to stop
I've never had marmite, but I'd try it
Talking about Fire Emblem?
This gets better and better
Questionable
anything related to a name derivative of bernie
Wait, what's wrong with a name derivative of Bernie?
Dunno what Marmite is
Isn't it a thing popular in australia?
I think brenden has tired of your creativity
It's actually really popular in England. The one I hear from Australia is Vegemite
Are they the same thing? Don't know
what is fire emblem?
nintendo game
ok no
Non-work activism was preping to riot for you Aysh
wayfair files a claim that someonme works here, USCIS comes confirms that they do. there is NOTHING wrong in that
ahhh, I knew there was a "mite" somewhere in Australia
From Zero Punctuatin
Boooorenden more like it
It's a ~waifu simulator~ tactical strategy rpg
Is Boooorenden your way of saying :you: think Brenden is boring?
nothing is wrong with a name derivative of bernie
just too much of it in one thread
also the word waifu makes me uncomfortable
Too calm Aysh, clearly they're hear to taz you if you murmur a single wrong syllable
Alright, let's chill with mocking people for caring
lol woudlnt it be funny if that actually happened to me though haha imagine you read about it in the papers hahaha that they threw me off an airplane because they thought i was a terrorist hahahahahahahahhaha
Well, I mean, Leonie is obviously the best waifu in that game, so I can see why you'd be uncomfortable with me saying Bernie is even close to the best
I think caring is great- I think getting facts straight is good too, you know?
I soooo want to know which aspect of the word Waifu makes you uncomfortable if it also didn't make me feel so uncomfortable too
There's caring, and then there's insisting that you're going to escalate a situation
If you're uncomfortable with even Leonie being the best waifu in the game, who's your waifu in FE:3H CJ?
It's Rachel going a bit overboard and everyone else saying that it seems like a common situation that's not that bad more than likely
I mean honestly the targets are sexist.  It's all males they've identified.
yeah its not everyone, that ill give you :smile:
Or nice?
I was referring to Brenden I have not played FE:3H, waifu just brings images of neckbeards and lewd body pillows to my mind
Oh yea, most of the people have normal response. Although I found the you can hide at my house thing a bit overbearing
oh i didnt see that. can i go say 'no thanks'?
:hot-take:
It's not that it's not nice, it's that you're trying to be helpful and likely making the situation worse.  "Oh you say this is your residence but you're never home." Immigration lawyers are going to be way more helpful than that guy with a bed any day of the week.
1. People just talk on activism. 
```BuT wHy ArEnT tHeY dOiNg AnYtHiNg??????????????```
1. People say that they're willing to do something and stand up for what's right. 
```ThAt'S oVeRbEaRiNg```
Notice how I mentioned nothing about their desire to protest
That is totally an action they can take within their power
my most recent contribution to wayfair:
#help-no-stupid-questions-but-yes-stupid-answers
So
1. I actually kinda had a neckbeard this past weekend cause I was sick so I just stayed in Friday and weekend didn't shave for like, a week. And since I can't grow a real beard it was real bad. Was so nice to shave on Sunday
2. I hope you know I'm using it in a tongue and cheek way - it's kinda funny to use it like this
But Leonie is the best waifu in the game, hands down
Yea.... I can grow an epic beard when I want to
Mei stops me
I clearly get the fact you're enjoying using the word Waifu since it's been in every sentence since you started using it!!!!!
<https://fireemblemwiki.org/w/images/thumb/a/a7/FETH_Leonie.png/200px-FETH_Leonie.png>
:this: Best waifu in game
:facepalm:
Hmmm, how far can I go with this
CJ /ban is broken
please fix it so I can ban that word
It's not broken you can't ban words Dave or Doug say
They're not botified
The best part of Leonie? The tea parties with her in Three Houses are great
Waifu is a word I associate with people who unironically refer to themselves as "Incels."
```Wayfair was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the third year. We are one of only 12 companies highlighted in the industry of "Internet Services and Retailing" and we moved up one spot from last year to #3 in this category just after Amazon and Alphabet.```
yeah, my team was having a bit of a laugh at that list.
partially because the idea of admiring companies is a little weird.
but also because the list says Amazon is highly admired, which............ is a thing one is able to say.
Y'all have no culture :weeb-aaaaa:
I didn't think anyone referred to themselves unironically as an Incel.  I thought that was an outside label..... although deplorable should have been that way too.....
No, people actually do, it's sad
My :hot-take: is that only the companies with time and resources apply for these things
But I dont want incel talk/sadness to get in the same thoughtspace as my pure waifu discussion
time to go home time to go home time to go home yayayaayayayayayayaya
Aysh here acting like I didn't come in at 10:30 so I can go home now
So they're biased towards companies with time and money that care about their image
Soon:tm:
Oh man, you're ruined for your next job if they need you to come in at a normal time like 8:30 or 9
I'm sorry Dave, you can go back to your Waifu thoughts
lol
for me its time to play Glass Road (or Concordia or something) yayayaayayayayayayaya
time for the hot yoga  class i signed up for before knowing my thighs would give up on me and cant cancel becuase :moneybag:
Woof
Or Oof
Basically, good luck, sounds like not a fun experience
I mean, that's a good thing tho, right?
RAWRRRRRRRRR
Cause you would normally have quit on it, but now won't due to sunk cost, and you'll get healthier because of it
Thanks. Thoughts on posted Waifu?
My previous job required me to come in at 9
I usually got in around 9:45
It was the only negative thing in my performance reviews, so I was like "I'll try harder"

I did try harder, but it never lasted
But I'm lazyyyy
Did you do something to your thighs or is it the Hot yoga?
Waifu's are more about personality than looks
I did squats after two months
Before hot yoga
That sounds like you deserve this then
Yes, but both are important
Gee thanks
Sounds very not lazy. 
Pity me :cry:
Ok, I’m going to turn this bot a bit down when I get back to a computer. 
It’s repeating more than I expected. 
And Leonie is :justright:
Lol totally forgot that dave is now immune to bans since his identity was removed
I for one appreciate how late Chaos Seed pinged this thread
Does/has anyone here play/played Fire Emblem games?
I have the latest one on sewith but haven't gotten around to playing it yet
It's a good thing to play in my opinion
Have you been doing other, more important and fun things instead?
Nope!
I just started 3 houses last night. 
I did not.
Oh, that didn't end the way I thought it would
Gotta keep you on your toes
You may want to start it then - I love FE games, and Three Houses is one of the best, if really easy (for a FE game)
Really? That went about the way I expected
Oh, have fun with it! It's a great game. Don't do the route that I did though - it's like 4 chapters shorter than all the others and answers none of the questions...
Great game with a super limp ending (tho apparently the other routes are better)
I’m only like 2 missions in, but it feels a bit too much like persona than I’d prefer. 
Path of radiance was far more purely directed at what I wanted. 
Is this a FE?
Yeah, on GameCube. 
I’m the Deer house.

I played Fire Emblem the GBA version without any subtitles. Got right up to the end and just didn't finish it. Or go back and play the Hector campaign.
Having played it, I really really wish I had gone the permadeath route. Too many times trying to restart a level because I lost a party member. Dragged the game out too much
Good morning!
Good morning :sun_with_face:
Good Morning!
Good morning!
Nahh, that's the way to play! Never let a character die, even though you throw the console across the room when the enemy gets a BS crit. Newer games have ways to mitigate that though
And Doug, I've heard Golden Deer has the best story, so that's nice
Yea, it's a bit different from other FE games, but I really liked how they break up the battles. The most "pure" FE games are the ones on the 3DS other than Shadows of Valentina
I always imagined it's similar to the Tactics games on like the GBA - Final Fantasy/Orge battle Tactics
Yeah, it's weird for a game that flaunts perma-death, lots of people fail to let the game actually play out that way.
nice
I've alway let perma death exists, I try to mitigate it but it's part of the core functionality
Maybe the only place I haven't done that is Xcom but if you lose your crew of 20s in that you've pretty much lost
hello! my manager is leaving Wayfair
Good Take his/her job Aysh
BECOME THE GODDESS YOU WERE MEANT TO BE!!!!
I just wanted a bit more battles, less life sim.
LOL
no i wouldnt do well as an L5 and would subsequently be fired
so id rahter not :stuck_out_tongue:
well, get the L5 job, then your old job is open and you have to hire someone to fill it. so hire yourself. now that you have a new job, quit the L5 one.
Doug's wrong, get the L5 job, hire an L5 for your role, delegate all of the work to them.  Show how you're developing and growing people with your amazing skills get promoted to L6, promote them to L5.  PROFIT!
CJ, now you're just saying she should open her own MLM
I'm pretty sure that L5s in management don't need any "skills"
You just say things and go to meetings and everyone listens to you
It's not like you need technical expertise
MLM's don't produce anything, I'm saying that as a "senior leader" you need to demonstrate the ability to delegate successfully.
in order to not produce anything.
Dave's just being cynical now
ha, I got in quick enough so that the bot changed the timeline!!
I mean that is pretty much senior leadership
You *can* do that and skip all of the monastery parts if you'd like. I thought they were cool bc it added characterization to all the characters and was a nice change of pace from just battle after battle. But if you just want battles, it's not really that much less efficient to skip all the monastery
I........... like my job too much to even consider these. :stuck_out_tongue:
<@UDC03KCGK> I don't think the game "flaunts perma-death", it's more like "you have to play safe and be smart instead of just throwing your guys at them". If it didn't have perma-death, it'd be so much easier since you wouldn't care about making good tactical decisions
And this is why you'll always be a minion
What is that app even doing?
really? I seems the monastery can increase motivation, which increases stat gain in class, which improve combat effectiveness. It seemed like I couldn't skip the monestary without weaking myself quite a bit
I don't know, all I see of L5s is that they're in meetings all day and don't seem like they have to have technical expertise, just "gut instinct"
You can rest to increase motivation. I think the main thing the monastery does is lets you get closer to other characters if you want to recruit them
ok, CJ, Aysh likes her job, so you have to open the MLM
And honestly? Unless you're playing on maddening, the game is already really easy
My boss is still in my way along with her boss to the L5 level for me
Even if you don't like the monastery parts too, you can just do it once a month at the start of the month and do battles or rest the rest of the time
Hey CJ, I have this great MLM idea, but I need help starting it. You can make money from your home selling stuff online. Be the entrepreneur you always wanted to be!
I have a great idea for an app, but I don't want to have to make it
somehow the dash after the comma is really bothersome.
_but I get 5% of your profits for suggesting the ides_
lol
What about an MLM where you have to pay the MLM to get in, but once you're in, each person you recruit gets you money! You pay $100 to get in, but you get $75 if you recruit anyone else!
5% of profits is pretty cheap where do I sign up?!?!!?
Don't worry about exponential growth problems and all that. Just recruit TWO people you know and you've made a 150% profit!
I just need your social security number, full legal name, date of birth, and mother's maiden name to get you signed up
Y'all are sleeping on my idea
Dave dave dave, your ponzie scheme will never work because you're giving too much to the direct person. it's for every person you recruit you get $25 and for every person they recruit you get 10$ and so on and so forth
1. Not a ponzie scheme because I said so
2. That's the brilliance! It's so simple and so easy to make your money back!
Nora  from Queens
This...sounds like how things normally go
See drew gets it
I'm surprised by how many MLMs have staying power. Like, despite the unsound structure, they don't just flash in the pan and fizzle but actually stick around for several years.
Or how many people keep falling for MLMs despite knowing what ponzi schemes are and seeing them fail
Though, given the kinds of people I work with now, and see as patrons every day...I'm less surprised now
I have several uncles who have gotten super deep in MLMs
Perhaps unrelated, but they're also huge Trump supporters
Not unrelated
But I see the appeal to both. You're working long hours at a job with no real way of getting rich. You're getting by, but no real end goal in sight to retire or take care of your kids in the way you'd want
Eh, I think any game with perma death is trying to promote consequences. If you reset after playing a run poorly, you're muddling that. Play it however you want, but I believe that to be the intent
It's a critical thinking problem
You were taught your whole life that America is exceptional and you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps with hard work
They give you SOOO many characters along the way that it almost has to be designed this way.
well a MLM and a ponzi scheme are distinctly different
Well, that's a failure in teaching that people still believe that
So you hear about this company from a friend you've known and trusted for years. They tell you about it, and how it's different from anything else. It's been around for years, trusted by millions, have all these anecdotes about how great it is from all these other people
MLM can succeed, it just takes advantage of people
Ponzis can't
What makes an MLM different?
MLM just means that everyone above you in the organization benefits from your membership
ponzi is based upon lies
Maybe you even try a few of their products. They're probably decent enough quality. Then we get to rewards structure. It looks easy on the surface, but complicated once you get down to it.

BUT, you're sold on the dream. You WILL have to work, and work hard, but you can have the life you dreamed of
Not talking about ponzi schemes here Brenden
Talking about MLMs
drew brought them up
so yes it was mentioned
I did
Mmmmkay, but this is about MLMs
At least what I'm saying
I'm aware
Anyway
Yes, and until this thread, I didn't know there was a significant difference
No one didn't hear you Dave
that's why I was trying to clarify
Yea, sorry, didn't mean to be confrontational, just wanted to clarify
You get started with it. There's a decent investment up front, but that's okay cause the products are good anyway. You start making some decent money by working hard (cause that's how they're structured). Some of your friends/relatives might get annoyed because you keep pushing this, but it's fine
separate thread for ponzi vs MLM <@UDC03KCGK>
ponzi would be telling people you can get them a 40% return on their investment
and let everyone invest
if people withdraw, you pay them with other people's money
it's not sustainable
MLM is predatory, but so long as people are willing to be taken advantage of in the hope that they can then take advantage of others, it's sustainable
Then you get invited to the Easter party for the company as a "premium seller". It just happens to be Easter Sunday, so you can't travel to visit your family, but that's fine, who really travels much for Easter anyway, and you weren't really planning to this year. It's fun and you meet other people who tell you they've made a ton of money on this thing
That's kind of my point, it's the same thing over and over again.
money just funnels up the pyramid in MLM
Then it becomes Easter and Thanksgiving
And you're surrounded by people who all have bought in as well
And your family/friends, people who would be able to "wake you up" barely ever see you
Still, they are both pyramid schemes
And you're holding onto this dream that you'll be able to retire and live off the proceeds by age 40, cause that's what Jerry and Nancy and Jill did
I'd argue that a ponzi isn't necessarily a pyramid
Dave, do me a favor and take a minute to read before you keep going
You're essentially Youtube comments at the moment
ponzi could be one guy selling everyone else investments
?
there's only two tiers
lalallalalalallalalla
I'm giving you the story of one of my Uncles
that guy, and then everyone else
You're describing an MLM
Yea, I know. You were asking how people buy into MLMs despite being smart people otherwise
This is how
You're not describing why people can know what it is, and continue to get sucked in
Literally the story about how one my Uncle's bought in
That's how though. You've heard about it and are skeptical at the start
But it builds up little by little
Had your Uncle any idea what an MLM was or even the acronym?
Then I was going to say even after all that and it comes crashing down, the next one isn't as bad because it's not about corporate culture, it's just about selling miracle juice
I've seen my own sister buy in. She also bought in to a cult
He completely knows about MLMs
The miracle juice is nothing like the other MLM, it's just a way to make some side money
can you spin up another thread to tell the cult story?
...............what cult? I need to hear that
And then the cycle starts again
Cult story
here
here
Yea, Pyramid scheme is a weird way of getting money that requires you recruit other people and you make money on the people they recruit.
It sounds remarkably similar to Dave's story. Sister was raised Catholic, but her husband was Baptist. They go find a "Baptist" church that's set up in what feels like a weird convention center or warehouse area.
It was originally, but then they realized that people didn't want to lose characters, so they started designing around not losing the characters, at least on higher difficulty levels
And you lose a decent amount of story and all that if you let characters die
People are charismatic enough, and the pastor welcomes them in.
Church goes from Sundays, to Sundays and Wednesdays. No biggie, other protestant churches do this.
Say that you didn't have permadeath - I wouldn't have to worry about chokepointing with a general and baiting enemies out. I'd just throw my units at the enemies until I got them all down, cause your units are much stronger in general
Then it becomes more controlling, telling the women how to dress, or role of the wife to the husband
Then they start scheduling events and activities, and you should go because we're "all a family"
They make a point of slipping in anti-Catholic rhetoric pretty strongly any time my parents or I visit
Then they start bashing other christian sects.
Then they bash Baptists...
Pretty soon, they were at "Church" basically every day of the week.
A Ponzi schema is a pyramid scheme rotated so the hierarchy axis becomes time.
When they finally had to move to San Francisco, there was a very strong pressure on them that my brother-in-law should just commute down every day but they should not move
So unfortunately for you all, not a sex cult in the woods with blood sacrifices, just a way too deep down the rabbit hole of a church trying to break away and control a community
I liked permadeath in previous FE games. but because they set this one in a school I can't do it. I'll sacrifice my mercs, not students.
there's a large jehovah witness sect near my hometown
they're similar to a cult
But exactly what you describe in MLMs is pyramid
and usually with the investment ponzis, you recruit other people as part of it
yes, MLM is definitely a pyramid scheme
MLM (multi-level marketing) is a euphemism for pyramid
Having been raised Catholic, the argument can be made that is also a cult. There's arguments that any organized religion is a cult
but what I'm getting from this is Ponzis are a broader term, or at least a very distinct term. Pyramids can be Ponzis or MLMs, MLMs can be Ponzis, but not all Ponzis are MLMs
Investment ponzis generally you don't get more money per person you recruit, whereas most MLMs you do
The big difference is that Ponzi does not need hierarchy the same way. The Ponzi schemer can do everything themselves, they don't need other people. The trick with a ponzi is you use future money to pay the past.
A pyramid scheme you use bottom money to pay the top
read the madoff story, not at all pyramid like
I get the story of people falling down the rabbit hole, I guess I'm just surprised they can let that happen repeatedly.
I'm with CJ, the fact they are Trump supporters is not what I would call unrelated
sort of, part of the definition of a cult is that it's deviant
so if the religion is widely accepted, then it can't be a cult
I will
which is stupid IMO
but yes, religions share characteristics with cults, because they're just different classifications of similar things
This helps that I'm talking about an older FE game. Distinctly the first American ported one (or at least to my knowledge)
I'm not saying permadeath doesn't have its uses for strategic points, I just don't believe in earlier games it was strictly for strategy but also as a way to suffer consequences
Like I LOVE the first run I have of any game, and I'm always sad when I fuck up, die, and get sent back, because there is something I really enjoy about going through a series of battles, set-pieces, etc, as a cohesive unit, and not when it gets broken up because I didn't get gud
Well, it had been a bit for that bot
I really LOVE the first time I run through battles, set pieces, etc. because I like how I am not supposed to have prior knowledge from me dying and repeating it. Always makes me sad to repeat parts
Drew the primary difference between a ponzi scheme and an MLM is what they sell.  Ponzi scheme sell nothing, and they depend on new more new recruits then current members to sustain themselves.  That's why they fall apart, because geometric increase.
Religion can totally be a cult
But I get that technically, it has to be deviant
So all religions were cults?
Then...weren't?
CJ, I don't think I agree with this characterization.
probably?
Ponzi schemes sell things. financial services are very much things.
But yeah, this church deviated quite a bit. The only reason not to call it a cult was it was still "Christian"
Yeah from wikipedia, it still structures on this paying earlier investors with later investors payments
which to me is a pyramid
MLM sells a product, the people who "make it" started at the beginning and are able to collect these residuals.  They sell a real product that does things (lets go with ethical ones).  However the average person isn't going to make it because you need to build a massive network.  The easiest "ethical" MLM is going to be mutal funds
except you don't need the middle-men as sellers.
Financial services are not 'things' IMO
An ponzi scheme doesn't "sell" financial services
it's a service
think implies materialistic
so selling a physical product
They make promises they can't keep indefinetly but that they can keep _today_
I get how an MLM is distinctly different from Ponzi, but they are both pyramids
hmmm question- did you/ parents raise concerns about this with yoru sister? How did she react?
But a ponzi isn't a service, unless you consider me selling you the brooklyn bridge a service
In which case, I can sell you a piece of the hoover dam
I mean Drew, everything in captialism is going to have pyramid like effects, it's how the system is designed
Wayfair is a pyramid because steve and nirja make all the money and I make nothing
• In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a "hub" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. Failure to recruit typically means no investment return.
• A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.[5]
• A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.[11]

So I was wrong
that definition is quite good
Yeah CJ, a super slow pyramid. Those one time recruitment bonuses are totally fueling Wayfair's success
Sorry we're explicitly talking about fraud and I missed that
because MLM are not pyramid schemes
?
What?
MLM are pyramid schemes
They're not, which is why they have a different definition
MLM is multi level marketing
its a euphimism
It's marketing with layers
No
Trolling?
I'm not
ok, you have to be more clear after we spent 100 message trying to agree on definitions of complex financial actions
MLM can sustain in definetly because they SELL A PRODUCT through direct sales
But it is still a type of pyramid scheme
A real tangible product, now unethical MLM will sell you snake oil, but they still SELL something real
except they aren't really selling a product, they are selling the ability to sell a producty
pyramid schemes do not require that you don't sell a real product CJ
I can sell you snake oil in a pyramid scheme
So- Godmen are relatively common in India . They're always made fun of by general public/ movies/ media but there are enough numbers that they still get critical mass
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6MwGeOm8iI>
If it was real, the company itself would just sell the product. Why am I buy ing a product from a person who bought it from someone who bought it from someone, etc
I'm defining ethical vs. unethical.  Your alcohol distribution is MLM
There's a guy who has the rights to an area, leverages other sales people in the area to sell
Lots of people are totally UNETHICAL about it
It's like calling someone a retard
It has a real medical definition that is no longer used because it was corrupted.
MLM is `a marketing strategy for the sale of products or services where the revenue of the MLM company is derived from a non-salaried workforce selling the company's products/services, while the earnings of the participants are derived from a pyramid-shaped or binary compensation commission system.`
alcohol is not sold this way
I'm willing to bet that distributors look suspiciously like MLM with 1 or 2 levels
Any sales force generally looks like MLM
Godmen?
yeah- men who calim to be God or connected to God directly (there are women too)
Honestly, as an outsider and not any religion, as was kinda said above, I feel like most/all religions have a lot of very cult-like behaviors
Like, I wouldn't categorize my relatives' (different ones than the MLM) church as a cult, but a LOT of what was said in the cult story applies to them too. I don't think they go every other day, but go to mass at least once a week and do things with the church a ton
I mean anything can be a cult, American's have a cult of the American dream
no, we do not
Some of us do
`1. a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.`

`2. a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister.`

`3. a misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing.`
Cult is basically defined as excessiveness, which excessiveness is ambigous
no, cult is defined as posted above
3) is the definition i'm working with.
I get that, though I might argue that in this case 'the american dream' isn't a 'thing
it's an idea, ideal, or lifestyle
so ideas don't count, unless their religious ideas?
Keto? Veganism? Paleo?
EVOLUTION?
Brenden, does that definition require all of the above? I'd still say "The American Dream" doesn't count bc there's nothing sinister about it and it's not really a "group"
ideas dont count
American citizens ARE a group?
religious ideas don't count either
devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.
so if you're worshiping a god or idol, that would count
Religious ideas do count because definition 1/2
but not because they're ideas
which is what you were implying
Say there was a group that idealized the idea of the American Dream and started outsting and having hateful rhetoric against foreigners and preached isolationism and american exceptionalism and had a leader they almost deified
<@UDBGH9BMX> 1 of the 3
THAT would be a cult. But you can't just say "a lot of people subscribe to a nebulous idea so it's a cult"
Otherwise, everything would be a cult. Liking video games would be a cult
I mean I'm sure you can demonstrate video game cults, and I would basically argue you can make anything a cult just by shifting your prespective
Our obsession with freedom would be a cult to NK, just like we view them as a cult to Kim Jon
You could argue that, and I would likely argue against it :slightly_smiling_blob:
I would argue that our obsession with freedom isn't a cult
where we differ in opinion is the interpretation of 'thing' in the third definition
Just saying cults are defined as being on a spectrum, if everyone else does it's not a cult.
that's not true though
that only applies to some of the definitions
No that's sinister in nature, 3 removes the evil intent and just makes it excessive.  Excess is defined by cultural norms and cultural norms are defined by what everyone is doing
who is everyone in this scenario?
That's the kicker isn't it, and hence why everything is a cult
Because everyone has no good defintion
If you talk about the world, then america is a cult because we make a tiny percentage of it
If everything is a cult, you defeat the purpose of having the word "cult"
It has a specific definition to define specific groups.
And that definition isn't "every kind of a group that likes a thing"
Um...I don't think that is true
Like, sure you work on commission, but that isn't required for you to recruit other people to sell alongside you
Like I don't sell someone a drink and say "Hey, if you want to jump behind bar, you'll get tips. Just pay me 5% of your tips"
that being said...every 'services' based tech company (and consulting) is that basically, you give them a % of your income in order to have the  means to work with them
or .... Brokers
And yet lots of companies give bonuses for recruiting people Drew
Buddhism is the best cult :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: The version my family follow is to celebrate everything with food hehehehe. I like food cult. Don't have to do anything weird hehehe
Did we lose the emote for Deja vu <@UDC4QL95G>
nope still shows up
So why the Vee
Wait, are you comparing recruitment bonuses to MLMs?
I have to assume you're trolling by trying to be super pedantic about definitions at this point...
Aren't they kind of
?
It emoted my original comment, which triggered the Vee
You're not getting a % of their sales
But you are getting a bonus
You're not getting a % of their future recruitment bonuses
Consulting!!!!
That's the point of the MLM. You get a % of everything further down, at least in theory
I mean, this is a conversation getting super pedantic
Yea, most of what I've read about Buddhism is that it's pretty sweet
I'm just saying any sales org looks like an MLM because you literal get paid based on how well you recruit sales people
whats a buddhist dessert?
Don't make your target, don't get paid
What?
I see that, but at the same time, it is part of FE's DNA. I never liked sacrificing anyone I put time and money into, especially once they started getting characterization. Honestly, all the battles are pretty similar, and a lot of what makes FE great (for me at least) is figuring out how to get through it all without a character dying. If I didn't have to worry about that, I wouldn't have to try as hard and calculate as many things out.

Most battles last less than 10 turns, so if there isn't permadeath, you can sacrifice a character every other turn and you'd still have plenty to finish. So you can just run in and not really care who gets attacked (to an extent)
You have salespeople hitting quotas of cars or shirts. Or distributors selling kegs of beer to bars
Both!
I'm gonna check out of this discussion before I get mad about how pedantic and silly it is
That isn't recruiting sales people to do the same thing you are.
You still get a percentage of their sales
Maybe lay out a specific example, because this is too nebulous. We're talking about different sides of sales apparently
TBH i never saw what was wrong with MLM
My definition is that MLM has a bad rap because it's easy to exploit dumb people unethically
MLM is a legit business model, and has many parallels in the "real" business world
They are similar, but not quite the same. FF Tactics was great too, but imo FE is much better
Not to say some people are scummy as fuck with no ethics
I think it fails when the bulk of promised income comes FROM recruiting others to do the same, as opposed to it being an incentive?
I'll agree with Aysh on this
:yay I WIN!
Also Aysh going way back to your question: my family multiple times called her out on this. Or confronted her. It resulted in her being very defensive and acting out. Hell I stayed with her one night when my parents had to go home early from Thanksgiving, and she confronted me about not believing in being saved enough.
Really ruined our relationship for years after that and when I told her about that my senior year of college when she had broken away, she bascially didn't even remember it happening
people are crazy
yeah  i mean, if thats the definition is a bad relationship a cult?
I was asking for an example of a sales force being a legitimate MLM
Patriotism is a cult!
Some of the strategy of a game is tactical sacrifices
Just a big one
Right, which is why placing it on a school is oddly distressing. 
Getting to redo a scenario because now you know that guy will come out swinging to crit is unfair knowledge gained by repeating the scenario
I don’t want to sacrifice kids. 
KILL ALL THE CHILDREN!!!!
Your way of playing it is a way. I'm arguing that the game, at least earlier iterations of it, were designed for you to accept certain mistakes and not get redos
There are no big cults Dakota, then it just becomes normal
Also where did we move past that the American Dream was NOT sinister?
Like, what the hell, that's totally led people down the wrong path constantly
I wanna join a cult. Sounds fun
Sinister is not the only definition of a cult
Can we make our own cult?
yeah but what would our cult revere?
chaos :duh:
Who wants to start a cult with me?
Personal experience is Vector, because they set up a sperate company to sell their product.  But you think about mattress or furniture store, your managers the people who recruited you are paid based on your commissions, and the people above them are paid based on the how the store is doing. Do they draw a 1 to 1 line for you no.  But you'd be silly not to see that performance bonuses (which is generally the only way you actual get paid) is this concept abstracted
Depends on the what we're doing?
We decide because its ours
Have you seen _Review with Forrest McNeil_? Very funny. The is an episode where he starts a cult. 
hmm, is that what we have been doing this whole time?? woh
Wait, what makes an MLM illegitmate?
Yea but you gotta have a general idea of what it is
I NEED A SEED AYSH!
scummy products
But... there are scummy products literally everywhere
This is why you could never be a cult leader CJ :cry:
walk into a CVS and half the products on the shelvs are scummy
Ohhh I GET TO BE THE LEADER!?!?!?
I thought you were going to be the leader and I was going to be your chief of staff
A leader
ONE of them
we are all equals
no\
Yes, but there's also legit products there too
I’m being abuse by a parasite..... it hurts
an MLM that only sells snake oil is illegitimate
Im sorry, we all get to abuse the parasite with annoying cuddles and wooshy gooshy cheek pinches soon , so you will have your revenge
/roll 1d20 -1
/roll 1d20 + 1
So I definitely dodge the evil twin
LOL!
Not sure about the cigerette
15 is normal difficultly so I say you pass
why?
snake oil is good for skin
because it's clearly a trashy idea built by someone who just wants to fuck people over
So a website that sells only a crappy cheap keyboard is illigitmate cuz their product sucks?
Hooray, I got a free cigarette
I'm going to log that in my inventory
Yea I'll agree to that
Yeah, CJ your idea of MLM is getting very esoteric
what about selling Jewelry?
Markup on diamonds is insane, and they are practically worthless
Diamonds have value in manufacturing but yea I'll agree with debeers being illegitimate
or high end clothing brands that mark up based on teh brand name alone
It's not esoteric, I'm just willing to accept there are both ethical and unethical MLM where as people just want to say they're all bad
That one I'd question more, as the idea here is that you buy brand names because they provide a superior product.  Some of that as gotten out of hand though.
I think what you're missing <@UDC03KCGK> is that my definition is actually more broad than yours and you think it's esoteric because I'm only including the things you don't.  Which is wrong, I'm including all of it
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing>
You're describing corporate structure, this is a separate thing
Like, you're including too much that the definition of an MLM is meaningless when it is specifically about a revenue stream coming from recruiting people
I don't pay Wayfair $200 when I join them to work for them
I also don't pay Time Out for the product I am selling to customers (which is a problem for most bars, but I digress)
This is a really active day for Chaos Monkey
Most of the active days in recent memory have just been us hashing out definitions.
Yeah, definitely
ugh stop giving me bot ideas
I would argue (personally) that buying excess inventory is a dumb idea, and that really an MLM is based on the idea that I make commissions on my sales, and I make commission on the sales below me.  So my definition varies in the idea that I don't need to own the inventory or that i make money from whole saling
I don't have time to make any right now
Does that make sense?
Generally our active days are us arguing over stupid shit
It also help that both Drew and Dave on contributing because Dakota, Brenden and I like to be evil
At least this time it's not about the definition of a sandwich
Not really, because you're not being specific with how something you describe as most "
babbies are scary. whether they're still inside the tummy or outside of it
You just keep using very general examples
You can figure that one out
huh Drow lost his profile pic
We play the role of the straight guy in comedy
Which I just realized is sexist. Why can't it be the straight woman?
You need a charismatic central figure for a proper cult though
Or a gay woman who plays it straight?
And... I mean... not sure if any of us apply
Or is that the bit?
You can calculate all of that though - I never send a person in unless I know what's going to happen to them (or miss something)
There's no hidden information. Except for Fog of War maps, which I think are the dumbest thing in FE
Cause the computer still uses the same "AI"
You provided the ridiculous position there
Normally provided by Dave
This whole channel is one person having an outlandish opinion and getting roasted by the group for it
Very rarely do we have tag teams where there are multiple people on each side going to battle
Usually a 1vMany
Crits are part of the chance though
And Fog of War was a big thing in those early games
Only for that bot
From what I can tell
Eh, you know you actually do
Just doing it in between your actual work and the delays those pose
I would not call my categorization of food as a sandwich ridiculous
I think we've talked before that I think crits on enemies are bs. But not many enemies have crit other than some bosses.
I like Fog of War
Straight person is the foil to the silly person. So not straight in sexuality just in personality
I like it in non FE games. I like it in games that both sides have to play by the rules of FoW
fair.
it might not be the most FE thing
Nah i got a lot of work to do at the moment acutally
and the integrations I want to write are not the silly kind I can throw together in 2 minutes
Making you the 1 vs the many
Ridiculous seems kinda harsh
If we all say 'can not' then why do the British say 'can't' and not 'cant'?

Does anyone understand?
That's such a lie
Generally Dakota and I are the same side mocking everyone
wut
I say can't and cannot
Like...think of how someone who is British would say it
Why can't slack allow for voice notes
But what does pronunciation have to do with spelling?
They say it like "cahnt"
I'm just wondering why. Like.... They( and I) say dahncing because I say dahnce.

So why say cahnt when you say can and not cahn
Accents? I'm sure there's a long social/environmental reason why accents exist haha
...here lies my sad joke. Was brutally murdered by Señor O'Stabby
oh, you're not talking about the apostrophe, you're talking about the pronunciation of the 'a'? Even in the US there is a lot of difference on that sound. Midwest and New England accents are very different on it.
But why are Crits BS? You get crits, why can't they? Adds a chance that your plan will fail. Why have rng for stats at all if you think crits are bs?
And watch as this thread devolves into me being the 1, vs the many
Cause they can't be played around. You can play around almost everything in FE except (boss) crits that 1 shot your units. Say I spend 45 min on a chapter and get to the final boss. He has a 5% chance to 1 shot any of my units and I can't do anything about that bc of a crit. Anything else I can avoid by healing, rescuing, shoving, 1 turning him, etc
I swore I saw 3 of those gifs just now
Why do you get a crit though?
Especially cause bosses usually are very strong. Regular units are fine with crits cause they don't usually 1 shot and you can avoid them/bottleneck them/range attack them
I think the difference you're hearing between can and cant is because you're not really adding a consonant. You're replacing the 'n' sounds with the 'nt' sound. and vowels can change a lot based on the following sound
Cause the game is in favor of the player? All your units are stronger, you have smarter AI, infinite time (usually) etc.
It's an asymetric game
I view the boss crit as "There's a 5% chance putting this unit in harm's way ends very badly"
There are 2 different AI things:
1. Stay in place till a unit gets in range then attack it
2. Rush at you at max movespeed till they get in range of a unit
In both of those cases, they'll do whatever is the strongest attack for them personally
But if I don't, I need to maintain perfect distancs
Bosses usually have 2 range so you can't avoid it
But you can manipulate enemies in different ways to get all your units through. Except a boss just has a 5% chance to delete one of your guys with no counterplay
Part of the struggle of the game. To beat this level, you must watch one die.
You don't have to like it, that's not how you play
The game seems to be set up though to be played with honoring perma deaths and recovering from those set backs.
That's crazy talk. Or me using delete power
Well, I mean, they've added features to avoid this in more modern releases bc pretty much everyone has been saying it's dumb. It's like playing chess, but you have a 5% chance to lose a unit when you take a unit. It doesn't change how you play, it's just silly. `Part of the struggle of the game`
But you having a % chance to do really well or not is the same mechanic to me
Calling percent to do well vs percent to get wrecked different seems to me to be biased
Yeah ur opinion is wrong! lets fight!
YOU BAD AND FEEL BAD!!!!
Ohhh drama!!
I would call them ridiculous dakota
well, the whole burger thing anyway
Brenden you already got it wrong, we're here to bash on Drew's idea of 1 vs many
I believe I just proved that incorrect by arguing with you at this moment
No you proved drew wrong, we were trying to prove him right
This thread got meta
Let me send you  voice notes
on whatsapp
Did you see the Saudi Prince used WhatsApp to hack Jeff Bezos?
huh
^ I did finally turn this down
Prince MBS sent Bezos a message with a trojan to open a backdoor on his phone.
<https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/01/22/saudi-crown-prince-reported-to-be-behind-jeff-bezos-hack.html>
ugh its video
<https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/22/tech/jeff-bezos-mbs-phone-hack/index.html>
that is not video.
weirdly hard to find something from a major paper that was not either a video or behind a paywll.
Guys I'm so disappointed in myself
I'm only the 283rd most active member of Wayfair slack in the past year
Only 13,456 messages :a_blob_sad_cloud:
who is the most?
Didn't even break top 100
How is an AD and a Director in the top?
one of the most popular channels is #nonwork-gearheads
I'm assuming they're in there, or heavily involved in the whole actual wayfair operations channels that get a lot of traffic
cause they certainly don't overlap with the channels I participate in
Toby posted a lot when I was at Wayfair
he still does
It’s possible it’s because they want to sound fancy. 

There was a point in time where what we think of as a formal British accent was basically created as a response against lower class accents. Even today it’s said that every neighborhood in London has a different accent. I think what Americans think of as a British accept is that Oxford Accent, which as I mentioned, is just supposed to sound smart. 

I imagine that the Indian conception of a generic British Accent is different than the American one. 
SIGH!!!!
Don’t like my guess?
Not entertaining enough
I can make up something. 

So, during the war of the roses, the roundheads lost the decisive battle when a general told his cavalry “you can’t charge up the hill” and they misheard can’t as can, so charges you the hill, losing Cromwell the war and soon after, his head. Of course that’s when the Vampire King regained controlled of England, which he still rules to this day. So to this day British people pronounce can’t differently as a subtle protest against Denorac, Immortal Liege.
I appreciate this. Thank you.
:)
Now I just want to play Fury of Dracula based on this story
Clearly. He was #1
Like Dakota’s slack picture
Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen
Always happy to play that one. 
<@UDBV9N1E0> is an admin???
Is he?
Good morning people!
All our morning people are good?
or are you wishing that morning people in general don't turn evil?
Definitely the latter, do you know how much evil could be committed before the rest of the world wakes up?!?!?!
just so long as the night people set things right while the rest of the world sleeps.
Late start this morning
usually there is more chatter than this in the morning
bi weekly team meeting and other stuff delayed me this morning
guys I found someone that belongs here
Lol
We already have a Marissa though!
<@UDC4QL95G> busy day so I used my morning to prep
I dont like life today
me too Ayshu
I'm back to "parasite attaching its host" mode
Yeah but what if the parasite is my brain
The parasite is attached to it's host mei, DON'T DISCONNECT MY BABY!!!
If you want it so bad, why don't you allow the parasite to make you its host? Very rude to force the woman to do it, its 2020
Baby likes Mei, the baby won't even move when I come over sometimes!!! Very sad
Mei really wishes there was the tech to make me carry the baby
Maybe that's because you're trying to name the baby Elizabeth, which everyone has decided is a bad name
It's about time technology figured it out
I tried Jillian today, that got shot down too many syllables
Be the change you wish to see Victoria
You'd probably make it rich
It's only 3
But I don't want to be rich, I want to take over the world
Did you float "Davidette" by Mei?
Elizabetta. Italian name. Then you can still call her Liz.
Betta
that way you can make jokes like `you Betta get over here before I smack you`
"How you feeling?"
"Better"
"No I said how are you feeling, not your name"
Ohhh god
Dakota has ruined a pretty name
Sorry I couldn't help it
Mei would like less than 3 syllables\
As long as she has a sense of humor she could make it work
Frank
less than 3 sylables
Fun fact, mei floated the name Hailey and splet it Haly.  When I told her of the other spelling she disliked the name instantly
if you spell it haly people will say it hal-E
What aboiut haley
that will probably work
I've seen haley before, but it's unusual
If you make Men pregnant you could probably also take over the world too.  All the men having hormones and such.
Mei doesn't want a name with more than one spelling
My sister is Kaley. no one every spells her name that way.
I feel like most names have alternate spellings
Ouch
Amanda doesn't have an alternate spelling?
Ammanndda
Alexandra
More than 3 syllables
Also ex who's name was Amanda
call her Alex
But, isn't that what nicknames are for?
You're talking to the wrong person guys
<@UK7V13DS7> get in here
Mei's the one with all the weird rules that I have to find out the hard way
I want to give my baby a nickname, I like mine
Also Mei is so unassuming people have never heard of her before meeting them
let Mei pick a Chinese name. Those then to be fewer syllables.
That's not going on the Birth Certificate, she already promised
Eh, probably better to not have the nickname Jill anyway
I was gonna give her another J name and call her JJ just to fuck with people
JJ for a girl would be different in a good way. stands out.
two letter acronym names don't work well for girls
CJ is a great girl's name
just make her CJ Jr
AJ is common enough isn't it?
yeah
never met a female AJ
It's like a :50-50: on CJ's being girl or boy
Pretty sure I have....
I've seen both
make up a name. I'll even donate my recent creation, Denorac
I for one am :ok: with androgynous names
I'd hope so given you've had one for &gt; 20 years
Gotta give her one of those names that is spelled crazy
like Geoff
name your son Joffrey
so when he's being a little shit you can tell him he's living up to his namesake
Geoffrey, like the toys R us mascot
for a boy, Yi, for a girl, Yue
I suggested Jamie which to date is the only name not immediately shot down.
RE: Yi
We all know CJ won't be able to not think about Master Yi
Yan and Yue?
That sounds so anime
I looked up Chinese baby names
I wonder if they differ from Chinese adult names :thonkang:
yeah, names go through a generational cycle
Fuck yea, Master Yi.  Brenden do you remember the Jungle Yi video?
don't think I watched it
This was real old before Raptors back when it was wraiths
<@UETS9HTSS> This video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cw7DTvrdfA>
I'm not hard against a chinese name, but her last name will not go good against it
Maybe you just haven't found the right Chinese name
<@UDDE5960N> I'm mentally unable to finish that video
Did I snow overnight?
It
it snowed a couple days ago i know, not sure if it snowed last night or not
Or so terrible?
because it's so old?
You did not snow
Bingwen
My favorite girl name is Naomi, so I'd push for that
too many syllables
Naomi is a perfect name, all slander and lies
the latter
Has anyone watched The Umbrella Academy? No :spoiler: please, but I just watched the first episode last night and was pleasantly surprised by it
Eh, only nicknames I can derive from that are NaeNae and MiMi, neither of which i like
Don't need a nickname with a name that great tho
Also, I'd say "nimi", but that's fine too
I watched it and am eagerly awaiting the second season
I suppose she could go by Neo and control the matrix
Does it keep up the quality of the first episode? I was really surprised bc it didn't have the normal netflix pacing issues
Yes and no, I felt some of the episodes in the middle dropped in quality, but they redeemed themselves by the end
mmmm, sounds like netflix. But still good that it ended strong, thanks
I disagree with Victoria
The whole thing was fun
Sometimes a little predictable but otherwise solidly executed
I agree the whole thing was fun, just saying quality dipped a little
Dakota did you get that from the Ender's game universe?
And Dave no One Piece names
I do like the fact of calling her Neo though
Umbrella Academy Spoiler thread ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
You could name her after a greek/Roman goddess like Hera
<@UDD45P5A9> which part?
I think I tried that at one point, the greek goddess chaos but I didn't like it
<@UDDE5960N> silence chaos seed in that thread
:lol: I didn't think anybody else was reading the Formic War books
and yes, thats where I got the name
Silence chaos seed
got you covered
can't enter thread, whats with the squirrel
thread is currently safe
no idea what the squirrel is
maybe doug used it as an indicator that the thread has been silenced
testing
Silence chaos seed
Silence Chaos Seed
yeah it looks like the main message gets a squirrel now
yeah it indicates a silenced thread
interesting
That used to be my steam profile
yeah, I added it
I don't know if I ever set up a steam profile picture
I don't want One Piece, but now I'm sad bc I didn't think anime stole my name from me
NICE TRY DAKOTA I'M ON TO YOU!!!!
I don't remember Naomi being in One Piece
<https://steamcommunity.com/id/tehsquirrel> this is mine. Havne't changed my profile in forever
there is Nami
I suck at life....
Me too!
Ohhhh my bad dave
I bet I suck at life more than you do...
:weeb:
That's really hard to do Dave
nahhh
I'm REALLY good at sucking at life
Mei there's a whole baby naming thread that you need to weigh in on
HAVE YOU MET MEI!?!!?1
yea, a few times
There wasn't one specific part, it just seemed like the middle episodes were just too much backstory that seemed forced; unlike the previous episodes where you got enough glimpses that it was enough to know what was going on. The excessive backstory changed the pacing of the episodes in a way I didn't like
She's such a lazy bum, you try to hard to be that bad at life
she has babby
is alowed
parasite*
She has parasite...is allowed &lt;--- fixed it
You're trying to corrupt my name...
Tho Nami is a decent nickname
Official name is asshole raspberry 
.... so fart?
One piece is Japanese 
I can’t do japanese name
My family will kill me
Dont worry Naomi is not in One Piece
NO NAMING THE BABY ASSHOLE!!!
Yea I wish CJ feels all the pain that Im feeling 
did you just call <@UK7V13DS7> and asshole?
Pretty sure I have
Naomi is 3 syllabus
I suggested Haley not Haly
<@UDBGH9BMX> are you saying that one piece stole your future kids name 
No, that's fine since it's not Naomi
A model stole that name
Cj mixed up Nami (from one piece) and Naomi
name is also a LOL champ
I’m failing at work right now :(
:same:
I should just quit before I get fire
CJ, go make more money to support me
What do you do Mei?
Whenever I play a game with a female character, I name her Naomi cause it's just the best name
I tell people that they make mistakes and what the solution is
So scary... CJ is so excited and that’s scary too
I make a lot of mistakes
What's the solution
Stop making mistakes
Have you tried not making mistakes?
Be less dumb
I loved it and religiously listen to the soundtrack at least once a week
Yesss
I am not scary excited mei!
Don't bother about mistakes
Let someone else clean up
I prefer figuring out how to fix the mistake, then making somebody else do it
That doesn't really help
are you regular excited?
I feel that CJ will be a great dad
He talks in baby talk....
He is probably good at story telling 
If only his English is better ;p
And he's caring and looks out for other people
Mei you're a pain
What CJ meant to say is "Mei, your pain" because he's using the french word "pain", which means "bread"
He's bringing you bread. That's nice of him
But his English isn't great, you have to excuse him
Lies dave, I meant what I said!
Yea, that you're bringing her bread. You're such a good baby daddy
I'm banned from discussing names in this thread
why is that?
Oh, that's positive. It seems like a good un
You don't really help
Write better tests. You won't make fewer mistakes, but you can prevent other people from catching them for you.
Why? <@UDC03KCGK> 
In case it’s not clear, Davidette is rejected 
I still think CJ Jr is the winner
or JJ
How about MJ (Mei Jr)
No 
No 
MJ = mahjohn lol 
Nooo, why is davidette out?
My manager is leaving Wayfair
It is more than 3 syllabus 
I like the bread version better
I'm banned because I have a wife who would be very disappointed if I slipped out a name that we were going to use and someone else we knew used it. That's rejected a lot of names for us for the future.
Also I find the concept of naming a kid after you (or in Dave's case, someone else's kid) very strange.
Told mei it was probably sam. That's fine you can watch and laugh
Sam would be a fine name. Just steal that. 
Boy or girl. 
Are you happy or sad about this?
Or neither?
AWKWARD!!!!
Good Morning!
Summon the silent
I'm going with sad because this is the 2nd time she brought it up
Good morning :sun_with_face:
Ohh ok.  I liked it because it gives you context for why they're so fucking dysfunctional.  I mean that whole group was fucked up. And knowing why was nice
The bot is hacked by Russians
Oh Delvig, Delvig!  What's the reward
 And high deeds and verses?
 What and where is joy to talent
 Among the villains and fools?
Curious to see who this Delvig character is
YOU CAN TRANSLATE THAT!?!?!?1
It's called Google....
Again and again they fail
I mean I am, but that's beside the fact.
The translation I saw was:
&gt; O, Delvig, Delvig, what is the reward for poems and noble deeds? What comfort is there, and where, for talent that lives among villains and fools?
Google translate itsn't the best at poetry.
Why you don't pay them in advance :wink_animated:
I liked getting background, it was just too much at one time, it felt like when marvel makes a background movie to set up the main movie
What if they just steal the monies?
Then they're not assassins but thieves! And you should be more careful to with hiring in the future!
Yea the whole time travel kid story kinda dragged on
I'm trying to stay off the dark web, I heard that's where the bad people are
Yeah, she isn't trying to take their job
Who's ready for a 10 hour Friday workday?!
Which is sad, and totally what she should be trying to do
:boom:
This guys is ready for chinese new year craziness!
Well, I am, but by going to my friend Jess' CNY party tomorrow
See all's well
YOU GET TO SUFFER WITH ME!!!!
Why is this suffering? It's homemade Chinese food and fun
Yeah, forced everything into the first season when they could have saved some for season 2/3 and added some mystery throughout the show
Sesame seed balls! All of the sesame seed balls!
Because clearly you're not going to be the only white guy there
Yeah, there's a whole chain to L6 just waiting for her
True that, although I'm curious to see what they do with the crazed sister now!!!
Um, I might be? Definitely not the only non Asian friend, but possibly only "White guy"
LOL!
Same
Alright fine, only no chinese person
Which is why it's sooooo boring!!!!
I want the food I wantttt
Oh I forgot I said it before. So I can elaborate on Monday....but I definitely provided not very positive feedback (and four other colleagues too) about her to our director
Oooooh
Good job both of you (Marissa and Google)
Why is that boring? I have friends there, all of which speaking English, and really good Chinese food? I'm not someone who really likes Americanized Chinese food. Give me Dim Sum any day
No I think that's the part your missing Drew
Your's is fun because you have friends, mine is boring because most people can't talk to me
OHHHHH
STORY TIME BITCHES!!!!
:this:
:this:
Story time please!!!
Should I wait for Monday? she's still here officially....
I'm certainly not going to share this story with your manager
Well....I was having several concerns about her performance and guidance she was (not) giving. She would also ask people where they're from, what college they went to, effectively say she will not go say 'Hi!' to new L1s and that they should because that sets the tone.....
She constantly backbit(ed) about her  product counterpart to me (an L5) and even told me 'he doesnt like you and me, I dont know why' this understandably gave me a butt load of anxiety
she wAs new to the company. She was also replacing Corin who is awesome so that didnt help
so, a few months in, i started taking notes of all these and spoke with her manager (a Director)

A month later, 3 of my peers (who also report to her) approached me and said the same  things. I told them I agree and that I had already taken the above action


Eventually we all did the same
She was given feedback and time to improve.... Im guessing she didnt and was asked to leave.... (GUESSING)
Soooo just a super catty AD
Icky
i mean- she also didnt know anything that was happeneing despite constant reminders....
last week, I asked her a technical question and asked for help (just for the sake of making her do something tbh)


She went and asked MY report the same question in their 1-1
Well, she sounds like a full on dumbass
Clearly you're more competent than this woman you should get the L5 position
she would be on her phone and laptop during 1-1s, ask us to spend time explaining things to her (8 months in, things that she can read emails and slack to uinderstand)
Sounds like some of the senior management on merch when I was there
lol I AM NOT
i am in merch wow
please give me names
Merch eng? Or merch ops?
Im in merch eng
Okay, I was in merch ops, so maybe different people
The change means Im going to be reporting to an L4 who is very talented and competent but also sloghtly intimidating
wow I say 'a l so '
yes you do
Well this is why it got banned
Don't feel bad Aysh I felt personally targeted with it banned ohhhhhh
That's still cool
I TOTALLY think that Marissa Wilson belongs here
the L4 will be able to teach you all sorts of new things
I mean we can inviter her
But she needs to play games
NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN WHO'S NOT GOING TO PLAY WITH US!
he will also (UGH) have about 7 people reporting to him, 6 teams under him and a team he is being PM for....
Well that's way too much stuff going on
Alright you're on recruiting duty then Aysh
yeah so im just apprehensive about it
I think Brenden would be better at it
also- is this an MLM then?
WTF you guys are getting paid?
You're a baller and ass kicker! Just keep being you and you'll be fine
<https://media.tenor.com/images/c5e6ccbacc59e5d5b325a284431060a7/tenor.gif|https://media.tenor.com/images/c5e6ccbacc59e5d5b325a284431060a7/tenor.gif>
Wow. That was unexpected and nice and thank you!
Wait... I thought we were a cult
Why can't we be both?
Can you do both?
SHOW ME THE WAY VICTORIA!!!!
One more thing-&gt; Im kinda weirded out by reviews because  one of my self review points is "Convinced 'my new manager's' team to do X despite their initial reluctance" :cry:
Why does that weird you out, you effectively manage upwards
thats a nice way to put it :smile:
It's an MLM, because you have the newer members recruit people, but the older members get the rewards of more chaos and games partners. And a cult, because games
cult because.... You may never leave
isn't that just called prison?
Just gotta learn copr speak Aysh
No no no, that's called a roach motel
Or hotel California by the Eagles
Pick your poison
:when_you_do_things_right_people_wont_be_sure_youve_done_anything_at_all:

Lead
Polonium-210
Or perhaps botulinum
Americurium

If I'm going out, I want it to be obnoxious
Never thought I'd see so much heavy metal poisoning in one thread
honestly polonium-210 would be a terrible way to go
a month long slow death by radiation poisoning
I mean depends on how much you're talking about.... It could be month or it could be like a day
It's all in the quantity

<https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1220475659031580672?s=20>
Well, i've already had my first beer of the day.
Gonna be one of those kinda days I guess
But it's beerly the afternoon
We had a team celebration lunch, and everybody ordered drinks
Which is something you should never do on a friday if you need to get anything else done
You should always order drinks especially when you have work on a Friday
Yup, followed by 4:30 drinks for team board games, followed by 5:30 drinks for whiskey night with Waycomm
That sounds enjoyable, have a great afternoon/evening :slightly_smiling_face:
you should have gone get beers from Drew
I wasn't sure if this was one of those, `I need a drink or stab people` kinda days
Glad it's a good day
Umm yes to all the drinks. <@UDC4QL95G>
?
Should I be concerned about you Marissa
Fun it reversed the order
Help.
How do i stop doing air quotes when I speak?
Sit on your hands?
What if I am standing?
#help-no-stupid-questions-but-stupid-answers
I should be alright as long as I don't wind up at park again
Yeah, just one of those "Yup, i'm getting nothing done today" kinda days
Luckily meetings have kept me on points
Fine...stand on your hands?
Are you creally standing anymore at that point?
I say get the fuzzy cuffs out.  Can't do Air quotes hand cuffed
.....Good I have a few in my backpack
KINKY!
Yes, I too like to keep a pair of fuzzy cuffs in my desk drawer
:facepalm:
Also kinky Dakota
Crazy story. My main question is actually about of Corin is still at Wayfair or not?
Yeah, you get past that by playing poker with them while they drink
Do we have to kick <@UHQD9J1SL> out? Haven't seen her but the one time for games
You can get filled with enough radiation at the heart of Chernobyl to die in minutes
I contribute!
Heyyyy!
She played lunch games with us she's in
I made it just because it was your birthday game Drew. Just for that.
Still here to the last of my knowledge
Mine don't drink :( or play poker
Charades?
So this got me going down the rabbit hole a bit and seeing news stories about the undistributed supplies. It is pretty disturbing stuff, and kind of high lighted which news stories aren't getting to me.
<@UETS9HTSS> saucy bread tomorrow?
Yaas
I'll try to get it to you before Doug's
Thank you sir
Where do you sit
I'll have some for lunch
Bolyston, 222 me6?
What is this bread you speak of?
You will have to steal some from brenden to see
That might be possible :) can I have some Brendan??? Will it kill me
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger or something like that
Or to the hospital :P
I mean it's made in a bakery, I dunno what'll kill you
CJ; post the link to the place you order if from so she can call and ask about nuts
<https://www.depetrillos.com/locations/coventry.html|https://www.depetrillos.com/locations/coventry.html>
Thanks CJ :heart:
So, will it kill?
Goooooood moooooooorning Chaos monkey!
<@UETS9HTSS> soon to be a walking viral infection
<@UDDE5960N> covered in sauce
<@UPGVCMGD9> possibly hospitalized
<@UDC4QL95G> owed a coat and a board game
Doug MacDonald, the host has returned
<@UDBGH9BMX> asleep?
<@UDD45P5A9> mysterious and out of action
<@UHQD9J1SL> chaos waiting to happen
<@UDBV9N1E0> the worst or best admin, depending on your opinion of an active government
<@UK7V13DS7> tired of unborn little girls
<@UDTR9SLN4> still there, still lurking
<@UEA7LHFQS> lost on an ultimate frisbee tundra
<@UE2D3HCBW> never seen from again after that infamous party
Yes you did, and I appreciate that. Have you gone to games since though?
My bad, a lot of travel lately and today I start a new contract, so I may continue to be out of action for a while
YEA!!!!! NEW JOB!
Better or worse than the old one?
Only lunch she's too busy to hang out with us
Pretty much the same but maybe better? Time will tell
Boooooo
I hope you find something you enjoy
Good morning!
Today is saucy bread day!
Today is saucy bread day!
Happy (Late) Birthday <@UDBGH9BMX>
New orange line train spotted. Always going the other direction. 
Ive taken it at least 4 times now
It’s so shiny. 
they're not resigned to the shitshow that is the boston public transit system, so they're trying to flee the city
Good morning Drew!
Took the green line today. Watched an express train go by, got on the following train, Medical Emergency on the express one. Serves them right
I’ve had to get off a train twice for medical emergencies. One was a heart attack, the other time a dude in my car OD’d
Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
Jesus
So glad I don't have to deal with this shit on the commuter rail
It's one reason I prefer walking. I woke up a bit late today so wanted to take the train
They are really pretty, but I find the seats really uncomfortable
Hm, that is a shame. 
Dude says that he will not vote at all if Biden wins Dem primary, Chaos ensues:
```but I want you to know that people die for choices like this, and I want you to feel bad about that```
is that in politics?
yea
failure
/roll 2d20+1
these people are totally out of touch with how the world works.  Circus and bread
fun fact
/roll 2d20 k-1
There's a way to roll with advantage and disadvantage I thought it was K but I'm too lazy to look it up.
As it should
As it should, because that's how Trump won
No idea where you're going with this
&gt; Dude says that he will not vote at all if Biden wins Dem primary, Chaos ensues
It's the closest thing to somebody admitting they are voting for trump, and the channel explodes
Today is a good day
'I want you to feel bad about that' is about the most honest phrase I've heard from a human being on slack
Hmmm am I the only non-voter in this channel?
Hey, you're still getting the bills paid. That means a lot.
I cant vote since not a citizen
Ah, would you if you could?
Hard plastic is...hard
I dont understand all this 'love what you do' business. Bad job is better than no job
B line sucks.
<@UDC4QL95G> register to vote. 
To be fair, people are literally dying because of Trump
No point. I wouldn't vote even if i was regestered
How dare you not be able to get citizenship in one of the most difficult countries in which to do that if you didn't just get popped out by an already existing citizen. So lazy!
Hell, I still don't have a Mass State ID
Yeah I don't see how they are out of touch there. With the way the demographics are split, there are more registered Democrats than Republicans. So not voting, when he has strongly implied he would vote for a Democrat, is effectively like voting for Trump.
True, but not voting for trump is making a statement that he does not support Trump either
His argument is that if biden is elected, things will not get worse, but things will not get better either. By letting trump stay in the office, the Dems and the Public is galvanized to make a more significant change. Bernie in the office with a GOP Senate will mean nothing gets done
By letting trump stay, the Senate is more likely to flip in 2022
I would say that isn't the case. No one looks at the proportion of non voters and says "look at this big statement they've made about how the government sucks." People in power want you to be lazy and not vote, it's how they stay in power if you differ with them
It's about making a personal statment, not about trying to sway public opinion
In Mass, your vote means literally nothing anyway
Because not loving what you do and over working yourself can cause anxiety issues bad enough to make every commute one impulse bad decision away from being under the train.
We are overwhelmingly [INSERT DIRECTION HERE]
Hi, my name's Drew!
not true at all. Mass had a republican Senator just recently. The governor's race is usually close.
and the last Boston Mayor's race was between two dems, but theywere very different
If she's still been at lunch, that counts. Just wish she had time for after work
President is just one tiny slice
Last election had votes on Pot and affordable housing.
This is all in the context of only the Presidential vote
Did you vote for any other election?
Cause otherwise his point is the same
you should register to vote for Mayor and state attorney general, and referendums.
I should
Where does one do this
I don't even know who the current mayor mayor is, his party alignment, when the election is or anything. I know even less about our other state officials
Mayor is less about party and more about person
Lol i didn't even know that
We have Marty Walsh as Mayor currently
State level politics are meaningless to me
Nothing getting done is honestly a step forward. That's where the privileged comment is coming from in that thread. He's not the person who would be having to suffer the consequences of shit getting worse. People who are poorer would.
but tends to impact you more than federal law.
the more local, the less revered, but more important
which is ironic because your vote has more impact at a state/city scope
You know why the MBTA is so messed up right now?
Usually the same polling location as the larger national votes.
A lot of that is local government
<@UETS9HTSS> <https://www.boston.gov/departments/elections/how-register-vote>
Not caring as much about public transit
thanks
I can't claim to be superior because I don't know much about local politics
But to claim that it doesn't affect you is silly
agreed.
Keeping track of when some of these dates are that don't line up...are harder
I never claimed it didn't affect me
Was mayor part of one of the national votes? I don't believe it was...
I guess that's what I inferred when you said
&gt; State level politics are meaningless to me
Nah, I dont care about the affects.
mayor is an off year. 2017, 2021.
which is weird, but I don't make the rules
But you do care about the effects. We've had conversations about those things bothering you.
The lever to fix them is unfortunately clumsy and called local politics
No more than I care about natural disasters
You just complained about the T
do I have to register separately for state/city voting?
no
yeah its bad. Thats just a fact of life?
oh, so I just have to show up
got it
But it doesn't have to be
And with that, I'm out
lol
where do I find out where and when to show up?
<https://www.boston.gov/departments/elections/2019-election-calendar>
what if the T is a natural disaster? :thonkang:
<http://boston.gov|boston.gov> is actually really nicely laid out.
<http://www.sec.state.ma.us/wheredoivotema//bal/myelectioninfo.aspx>
Yeah, definitely missed that election. Thanks for the info Doug, I've needed to re register for this year and the primaries.
oh, actually, I might still be registered under my old address. hm
I changed congressional districts, so it matters.
The reregistering every time you move even one city over is a chore
they only have a calendar for 2019 :disappoint:
Oh, that's why I didn't vote for mayor
<@UDC03KCGK> same city. diferent district
I was in Brookline
what I need is a shared google calendar with events telling me to go vote today
...we can make one
that probably exists. there are a lot of voting initiatives.
It is when it goes off the rails
I'd argue that's not "natural"
still "distaster"
<https://www.rockthevote.org/voting-information/election-dates-deadlines/massachusetts/>
<https://ballotpedia.org/City_elections_in_Boston,_Massachusetts_(2019)>
Valid
Bills will continue to get paid, and hopefully in a few years when I've finally finished grad school I can do something better
I don't think you realize that Dakota just wants to bitch about stuff but not nearly motivated to do anything about it
Like stepping over a puddle
Do you have a voting option that says you dont like any of your choices? Would you vote if you did?
I think the idea is less good and more tolerable
I don't think that is an explicit option. You are allow to submit a blank ballot, or not vote on some questions.
Before a few weeks ago, I never realized how much I liked breathing unimpeded
Yes to Doug's response
<@UHQD9J1SL> <@UDD45P5A9> The Umbrella Academy is holding pretty strong through episode 3. I still think that Netflix episodes are too long (should be the standard 45 min), but the pacing really hasn't been bad. But I did get frustrated in the plot convenience/normalization of powers that allows the "bad guys" to get away in episode 3. That seems to fall into the Netflix trap of "good guys meet bad guys and bad guy almost gets captured but get away because of reasons:tm: " that pads their episodes a bunch
can you thread that
I may watch this and don't want spoilers
Ah, okay, sorry, just realized it could be a spoiler
np

The characterization, direction, atmosphere, and acting is on point tho
And so is the writing for the most part
Discount Ellen Paige is pretty great
........................... discount?
Haha, have you seen cinemasins before?
The youtube channel?
i have but i dont get the reference :slightly_smiling_face:
because... that IS ellen page
When there's an actor who resembles another actor, but isn't actually that actor, they say it's "discount brad pitt"
When I first saw the ads for the show on netflix a while back, I didn't think it was really Ellen Paige and was like "Oh, that show has discount ellen paige"
Ok bu for real: If it is a leap year, and you're full time at 40 hours  a week, do you get an extra day off this year?
just not a full day unless you accrue 8 hrs/day
I'm making assumptions
I don't get what you mean, also why I didn't get included?
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
And my brother was like "I'm pretty sure that's actually Ellen Paige"
no, you do accrue slightly more PTO though
1. I didn't remember you said you really liked it
pay is split in a way that you get a fixed number per year, so itll accrue slower maybe but total will be the same still
you're right though, Leap year should be a holiday.
no? I don't think PTO is linked to leap years
Even if you accrued more time it's not going to be a lot
back when people weren't good at calendars, they'd do leap weeks, or every once in a while a leap month. Those were almost always holidays.
2. Unless the time traveling assassins are Supers somehow (and we really haven't seen evidence they are), there's no way they should be able to stand toe-to-toe with the Umbrella Academy people. We see Number One all Hulked out at the end - there's no way a regular guy beats him in a fight, no matter how jacked you are
(I'd going to pretend Leap seconds are already micro-holidays)
And they lampshade not using The Rumor ability - motha trucka, this is a life or death situation and they're shooting up the mansion and people could die. Just say "I heard a rumor you dropped your weapons and stood here and told me everything"
They get mad at Discount Ellen Paige at the end, forgetting that pretty much none of them used their powers in the actual fight
This same kind of story beats happened in Luke Cage, Jessica Jones
DO WE GET EXTRA PAY OR EXTRA PTO BECAUSE ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE TRUE
Cool, just re-registered
You get an extra week of pay occasionally
What?
The extra pay thing makes sense
well think about this way, leap years add 1 day every 4 years.  So what's harder to deal with a errant day every 4 years, or just adding a whole week every 20 years
at CVS a couple yeas ago we had a 53 week fiscal year
I complain, not with the desire for things to be better, but just cuz it's fun
You get extra pay. Even when you are salaried it accounts for how many hours you worked in the last week
It is a matter of projections and perspectives. You have to weigh nothing getting done in 4 years, vs 2 years of things getting worse and then things getting much better. After 4 years, maybe things will be better than they would have been had we had 4 years of nothing
Well i'm not gonna vote in the hopes that the next mayor will reduce the number of hurricanes that hit boston
See i am affected, but I don't care to the point of wanting to do something about it
And i'm not going to take a passive route towards fixing anything that does bug me like that such as voting
But that isn't passive
What do you mean not passive. You cast a vote, and hope the thing you voted for happens somehwere down the line
or hoping the dude you voted for makes the changes they promised
That's underestimating the amount of damage that's been caused in 4 years
This has nothing to do with the amount of damage done in 4 years
IF X means you are at X in 4 years, but Y means you are at X+1, then clearly Y is better in the long run
Sure does. Undoing damage takes significantly longer than making it
And this isn't even my argument!
He is of the opinion, that leaving trump in now will result in a more positive result than 4 years of nothing.
but he's saying that we'll be in a better state after more than 4 years
Yeah, which is why people are saying he is privliged. He is not suffering the consequences of the bet he is making
so it's not a 1:1 comparison
Sure, even if it is more than 4 years, the argument is the same
sort of
if biden:
&gt; after 4 years we're at position x, with uncertain future
if trump:
&gt; after 4 years we're at position x-y, with positive future
those are hard to compare because of the uncertainty
Yup. both the uncertain future and how large y is is impossible to tel
That's why people are upset with him
yep
It's a bad gamble, that he can make, because the effects of this gamble do not affect him nearly as directly. It is thinking selfishly about himself, and not the effects it has on the collective
View it through the window of the last 3 years. It's been an unprecedented amount of damage. Stopping that for 4 years is almost guaranteed to be better than letting that continue
Canceling Norton is a pain in the ass
O
someone just came out as trans in my team's large channel (79 members) with an :ath::ere:
Im sure that was tough for them so good for them!
I view that as unnecessary
I think his entire argument is arguing for the collective
short term vs long term benefits
Maybe I'm being close minded on this
I also kind of thought the :ath::ere: was a bit unnecessary
its possible they dont want to have to come out repeatedly for the sake of anyone who missed the message?
certainly possible
It's basically the same reason cops go under cover. They help commit crimes in order to get a more positive result than simply stopping the minor ones
that's exactly what he's arguing for, but as someone who won't feel the negative impact of said argument being implemented, people are getting justifiably butthurt
its not an every day thing so I think the at here is ok :shrug: but thats just me
TIL justifiably butthurt is an oxymoron
Yeah, it is an interesting discussion. Like I was thinking the other day, I don't think my kid should ever have to "come out" to me someday if they end up being bi, gay, etc.
Just, show up one day being like, this is such and such, and I'll put the pieces together
yeah butthurt implies that they are not justified in being upset
So I don't think this person should have to explain to everyone "Hey I'm Trans!"
Maybe if they want everyone to address them with different pronouns and like Aysh said, just save them the trouble
The people who similiarly will not be affected by the "gamble" are butthurt. those that will be affected are justifiably upset
they did request certain pronouns
is it a private channel?
Got it. Next discussion this brings up, is it on the person to have to say "I would like different pronouns"?
I think yes? we cannot guess their preference?
I've seen campaigns of people saying we should start saying "My preferred pronouns are x"
Which I've frankly looked at as weird. The point is to normalize it, but I'm conflicted.
It could be, hey here are my preferred pronouns, and also my name is _blank
Im trying defaulting to they but its a tough change to make
I'm fine with using they for everyone. I'm more uncomfortable with starting every conversation with someone new as "Hi, my name is Drew, I prefer he/him/they pronouns"
It's a wide sweeping change that takes a lot of time, and I'm not sure for what percent of the population.
Sure, you had to actively go out and vote for someone with the fraction of power you have. That's active, versus not doing jack shit, which is passive.
You didn't go out and pull up a train tie, or take a job at the MBTA, but you did more than what you are currently doing
If you actively want change, you go out and get people to vote, organize rallies, get the word out. Simply casting a vote is passive
my thoughts are that it's on the person to ensure people know what pronouns they want you to use
I don't think standing up and defending those that will justifiably upset should implicate them as "butthurt"
I dislike using they for everyone
other languages specifically have a gender neutral singular pronoun, english doesn't seem to
if we want a word, make one; don't use they
Interesting argument
I like it
But yeah, as cold as it seems, I think it is on the person to state what pronouns they prefer. It's on the collective to not be dicks about it
Thus Justifiably Butthurt
While recognizing that isn't 100% fair
It's also on the person to not be a dick about it as well
I think that is a loaded term
Like if you go by a unique pronoun, and I get it wrong, that doesn't give them the right to blow up in my face
It's saying they have no reason to be talking politics and saying "Hey, I think you're wrong and you should reconsider your stance and how it affects others."
but they is also used as singular but to indicate respect?
that's not what they said though
they said `but I want you to know that people die for choices like this, and I want you to feel bad about that`
yeah, my usage of justifiably butthurt was incorrect
You clearly haven't voted in a while. Sometimes it's an in out, done in 5 minutes thing. Other times it is like getting your license renewed at the DMV/RMV
Yea but how do you pay for a magical extra day
Like everything you said is active, is predicated on people going out and doing this time consuming chore, that you yourself also has to do to not be a hypocrit
and `but your arguement is uhh gross`
they is not ever grammatically correct to use as a singular pronoun
it has become somewhat common usage though
due to the lack of a better word
I don't see the `but your argument is uhh gross` line, but I only have the one screenshot you gave me
What? It is not a matter of where you have to go or how long it takes to classify it as active or passive.
What they said still reflects that in the context of everything else they said. Your opinion is damaging and has consequences that we just saw play out in 2016
it is the fact that you are simply giving a personal opinion, and hoping that that opnion will cause the change you want somewhere down the line
The last 3 years are things getting way worse to "make things better for the future"
He's proposing, let's run that back.
There are very real chances that if this election turns up Repbulicans, that elections will be irreversibly corrupted
how about we cull half the population in order to end food shortages /s
Like how we look at Russia or North Korea and see headlines of "Overwheming support for Putin!" and we all go, "Well that's a sham"
we've gotten to a better state for world hunger in 5 years, it doesn't really matter what happened in the interum, right?
I think what you guys are missing here is the idea that you can't die a slow death
Go on
Yeah, and who wins takes actions that affect you. It's not direct action, but it is still action.
Is it the MOST active? No. Passive though is, "I sat on my couch, I didn't go do the one basic thing I do have power to do to affect it, so I'll just hope it gets better"
That's literally passive
No that is doing nothing
Look at the roman empire, gradual decay.  You need something to galvanize against.  The american revolution occurred because of something new.  There's only so much outrage to go around, there is only so much pressure that can build.  Only with this does change occur.
That's what passive is!
Voting is a passive method of trying ot make a change
Peaceful, yes, but not passive
I'm with drew here
voting is not passive
So if you keep suffering slowly no one ever feels enough pain to make a change.  But if you get a lot of pain at once, then suddenly you do something about it.
Or simply stated, look at the number of people who change life habits after being told you're likely to have a heart attack vs. those that have it.
If you are trying to drive public opinion, getting others to vote, etc. That is active
Simply casting your vote into the wind?
how is that not passive
Those that have it, suffer a lot for short while for a better overall health
both actions are active
you went out of your way to register, and attend the polls to cast your vote
And I would personally argue, people are Naive if they think they're won't be suffering
I think I'm confused by your initial "you can't die a slow death" while giving an example of an empire that did just that
sure, activism is _more_ active than just voting
But that's my point, I *DON'T* want that, but that's what Democrats will give us
it is literally the most passive thing you could do to drive change
I don't think we were dying a slow death under Obama at all
We made significant progress
I think we got the extreme example, people are pissed, and trying to correct that
So then go do it
For this argument, I always like looking at religion.  Like gay marriage, rather than argue with the pope, tell him to get lost and found your own church.  You don't need to steal pronouns make your own!
You said it yourself, it is the least active thing you could do
So what's the big deal? Go do it
We're not pushing you to go out and campaign. Just spend the same effort you did talking to us, to go do it
Eh, the pope has lightened up on it a lot
Other popes didn't
We will only use gender neutral singular pronouns in our cult.
I know but I'm just saying why fight against crotched old men when you can make something new
`And i'm not going to take a passive route towards fixing anything that does bug me like that such as voting`
But progress against what? And I like Obama way more than Trump, but he expanding the spying of american citizens, continued to use drones, continued to use torture centers.  Sure he got the ACA passed, but it doesn't achieve the things it was set out to do
I remember people celebrating his election, but for the US nothing really changed from the Bush era, other than the person speaking was more articulate
It seems people care more about feeling like they make a difference than actually making a difference
will we make them?
Yes.
That statement is terrifyingly true dakota
I'M ON BOARD FOR THIS THEN!
Right, we're arguing you would be taking the least active route
So go register
In my language, we often default to 'Adhu' which means 'that'

If no one is respected as a person, no one can be disrespected as a person either!
<https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ovr/>
We went from the 2008 financial crisis to the longest running economy without a recession
We will likely be in another crisis shortly, due to actions taken by the guy currently in the presidency
I'm not saying Obama was perfect. I am saying that if you want to argue slow death, Trump has been the lightning rod to get people pissed off enough to try and fix it
We don't need more Trump and more pain to get the message
Or else we are too dumb to live
No I wouldn't. If something bugs me to the point of wanting to do something about it, i'll use my privelege and selfishly move somewhere it wont bug me anywmore
it would have to be pretty terrible to get to that point though
Voting isn't active enough. Decisions should be decided by champions battling it out in random board games
That sure wins people over...
Also have fun moving out of the country, it's not as easy as you think
(For the finanical crisis statement) Which is still running, has led to NO increase in wages, and has some people wondering if something has fundamentally broke in our understanding of the economy.
As to your trump comment, I mean that's what I personally hoped for and I think the guy is saying that if you vote for biden you haven't gotten the message and we need to drive it home more
Some people might called that a privileged stance, but I think it's the right stance.  If we haven't suffered enough yet to want to fix the system.  Let's continue the suffering till we get it
Which is fair. I'll be extremely disappointed if it is Biden that wins out
I don't want "Let there be peace in my time" leaders.  I want my baby to girl to have a better chance
I'm curious as to what it would take for people to finally make it hurt to the 1% by all walking out on the job
You'll never get that, but you might get a 2nd civil war
Have you ever seen no game no life?
The fact that a 2nd civil war is more likely than a mass work protest is baffling. Not saying you are wrong, just that it is fucked up.
What?
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Game_No_Life>
Wait, who am I winning over? How hard can it be to move to canada
I'm going Warren. I'd take Bernie. I'd settle for Harris, straight up disappointed if people go with Biden
I would still go Biden over Trump
I think it goes back to circus and bread.  A mass protest you can avoid by giving entertainment and food (see today), the things a revolution spawns is way harder to migitate
Bernie&gt;Yang&gt;Warren
THe non 1% cant afford to not be paid. The 1% can go a few paychecks without money
I think what drew is not articulating well, is that local elections you have a meaningful impact on.  And that person has a meaningful impact on you.
Eh, most of their wealth evaporates when people just start raiding their stores and their warehouses
True, but if local policy got bad enough that It started affecting me, I'd rather move than put my vote in and hope
&gt; Eh, most of their wealth evaporates when people just ~start raiding their stores and their warehouses~ murder them and their families
Money is only good if there are people willing to take it
I think the idea to avoid the _bad enough_
I'm assuming the anime then? Any good?
Also that costs you a lot more time and effort than an hour out of your life once a year
I enjoyed it, but it's pretty much the decision you outlined.  Decisions are made by playing board games.
I mean making an informed voting decision should be more than an hour once a year
This is not new
I liked your reply Brenden
Did you know that's ALWAYS been the case?
Ellis island was soooo much fun to tour
Can we start somewhere? We're talking about Dakota, who would give money to the homeless but the hour out of his year to go to the bank to have 365 one's in his pocket was too much effort
I've literally offered for him to venmo me and hand him the ones
Which would be great, I have a lot of singles to get rid of
I didn't enjoy it :disappointed:
It was okay
I generally don't enjoy historical site tours/visits except for the views
People have tried using ze or se or something, but it never really caught on
But I've thought a few times about what would happen if I had a kid and they came out of the closet.
I kinda think it'd go like:

&gt; Dad, I have something to tell you. I'm gay
And I'd be like:

&gt; Hi gay, I'm dad
Interestingly enough, the statue of liberty is just fan-fiction.
excuse me?
are you denying the existence of the statue of liberty?
Ohhh I enjoyed visiting Elise because they basically reinforced the idea that this rhetoric is not new and people have white washed history to make it more palatable
it was originally intended as a memorial to the demise of slavery. After being put in the bay it just becamse the first thing immigrants saw. The poem was added decades later.
Pretty sure my response is gonna be "And....?
Didn't trump admin actually try removing `your poor` from that?
less dramatic than removing it from the poem
Yea, that's my other thought. It'd be like
&gt; And I'm straight. Cool, I guess?
he just didn't quote it correctly
it was still very boneheaded
It's one of my favorites, though it has some... questionable themes you might have to look past if you havnen't watched much anime
its close to the most famous poetry lines ever
If I were to apply for a greencard, it would take me between 40-100 years for my place in the queue to arrive and for me to actually get the greencard.

This is with the special provision that I had a post-grad degree and have a 'highly skilled, high paying; job.


In conclusion, it makes no difference.

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
I had a grandmother who came through Ellis Island. So that's cool
Yea.... the incest in Japan is super creepy
My roommate (L3 engineer at wayfair who was hired into labs as a l1) was deported in july cuz wayfair doesn't like helping people with visas or green cards
Yea, the lack of weighting for different countries is kinda silly - as I'm sure you know, it's almost impossible to get a green card coming from India or China
Do they not like helping, or sometimes is there just nothing they can do?
My great-grandparents were immigrants. they probably came through ellis, since they ended up in NJ. but I've never heard my family talk about it.
Green cards and sponsorship stuff are actually really expensive for the company, so I'd be surprised if they didn't help him as much as they could. But I don't know too much about it
Nah they choose to not help. It basically costs a company like $15k to keep somebody in the country
but wayfair instead "encourages" you to go work in their berlin office
I think somewhere there's the record of my grandmother arriving, but I don't remember where/if I saw it
That happened to Shivam
:several_people_are_typing:
could be worse; they could just say you're out of a job and on your own
Ive found the immigration department very responsive and do what they can actually...i also know them having moved at least 4 engineers to berlin since the us govt didnt let them continue working here
But doesn't Wayfair keep hiring H1Bs? So you'd have to assume they'd want to do what they can to keep them here
that'd be pretty cool
because simply voting does not solve the issue. it _might_ solve the issue at _some_ point
i had that typed out before I got distracted at work
its a complicated ever-changing system
There's someone I kind of know who had to go work in Berlin as well, but that's cause he just got denied/missed a lottery or something, so he couldn't stay
Despite both him and wf doing what they could
Nah, Me not giving to homeless is more than just. It would be inconvenient. it is a trust issue. And some of them are just jerks.
Nah if you do some reasearch, it is pretty easy for a company to keep an employee here indefinitely
wayfair intentionally does not do so
Work for a place like facebook and you are guaranteed to be able to stay
<@UETS9HTSS> Completely unrelated to this discussion, but how many hrs did you get out of Everspace/was it as good or better than other Roguelites? I'm thinking of getting it + expansion for $6.80, but not sure if I'd actually play it
i worked at a startup and they wanted to keep me indefinitely and we definitely could not find a way to
according to my roommate, it's just a matter of money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I never looked into it myself
i know people who had to leave who were employed by apple/ tesla/ uber too
you can individually invest about 500k in an underdeveloped area and the govt would give you a greencard.
the original everspace I got around 66 hours out of
got all but 2 steam achievements
want to thread it to not get in the way of the immigration discussion?
nearly 100% completion
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
already said what I wanted to
Oh, really? I had heard that there was an issue with replayability and repetition without the expansion
It's "free" on xbox game pass for pc, but without the DLC. And I figured if I wanted to play it, I should start doing it the "right" way and get the DLC
fair
Wait, wouldn't putting only an hour into an informed voting decision be worse than not voting at all?
do you need more than an hour to decide between trump and biden?
Getting you into the practice of voting is good in and of itself
Apparently. Also This was more about local government
Oh, I have the expansion
isn't uninformed votes what got us into the political situation we are in right now?
nah, I'd call that misinformed
not uninformed
fixed
Yea this is about Dakota voting on things that he has more control over
if you actually do 20 minutes of research into their platforms, you could probably make a decision
just don't source all your information from a biased source
I would be impressed if you can in 20 minutes identify the bullshit from the facts
Ah, okay. Do you like/play other roguelikes/roguelites? Does it compare favorably to them?
did you play Rogue Legacy? I liked that one a bunch.
I played FTL
binding of isaac
Just a general Wayfair note- there is so much emphasis being laid on how our reviews dont fit into a bell curve that I think we wont be getting full bonuses this year
pixel dungeon
It as good/better than those? I have a similar play history of them
OHHHHH
Where did you hear this nugget!?!?!?!
TELL ME MORE AYSH!
I didn't play Rogue Legacy actually, but I watched part of a lets play of it, and played a few games similar to it
my own assumption!
:lol: when the new L1 asked my manager what calibrations are, he was like "I'll tell you later, it's pretty awful"
I enjoyed FTL a lot, but overall I don't tend to enjoy rogue lites
It is 100% matching people to a bell curve
everywhere- but mails have been sent to managers reminding them about these curves and pointing out that we dont fit
When they rolled out the program last year, it was one thing that drove me away from the managerial path
Sounds like your org is gonna have a painful calibration
That's what this sounds like
I'm guessing wayfiar is looking for excuses to not give people the full bonus to be WayThrifty
When I started everybody just got the full amount basically no questions asked
I think it's more the fact that reviews are being more critical, so you can't just have 1,2,3
someone has to be a 4 or 5
Have you played their other game, `Into the Breach`? It's a really fascinating game that I'll binge on for like, 3 days, then make a dumb move and lose a character and then not play for a few months
I got more playtime out of everspace than any of the other three
Intro the Breach is sweet.
Nah in talking to my manager last year, they do not allow any teams to have everybody at a 4 or a 5
I like that it's not turn based
haven not played into the breach
It's like, the most *pure* tactics game I've ever played. It's almost puzzle-like in it's tactics
its so tiny
That's good info, thanks Brenden
maybe that has changed, but I doubt it
it doesnt make sense because a) you only mve someone to the next level if they have been performing at at least a 3 for the next level for 6 months so its unlikely theyll drop to a 4 or 5 after that
wait, i think my scale is messed up. 1 = good or bad
b) being  a 4 or (more likley) 5 means youll be put on a PIP and probably fired so then what
1= hood
I feel so clever when I stare at an Into the Breach turn for like, 5 minutes, decide that it's impossible to not take a hit, and then RIGHT before I move, I find a way to do it
ah. editing my last post. Teams aren't allowed to have all of their people at 1-2
yea, and the reason they're getting you don't fit the curve is because everyone is scoring 1,2, or 3
The faction where you set everything on fire is my favorite
Which just sounds like Aysh's L6s are pissed because they have to make decisions about who gets what
yup. If you rank your whole team good, at calibrations they will be like "Well who is the worst of the 2's, they are now a 3" regardless of the competencies
i think pressure is being put on them from the CTO level
this was sent to all engineering managers
Haha, my fav is the lightning whip one. Cause they're so much stronger than everyone else imo
Tho the ones that damage themselves are a lot of fun too
I was ok with Into the breach, I probably got a little too achievement hunty and got annoyed and put it down
yea.... I think this is more the fact that no one was critical of their team
not every team is going to have a 4 or 5 though
not every team is going to be dysfunctional
I dont' usually do achievements, but I liked them in that game cause they add to the game and are used to unlock things
and if every team need to have a 4 or 5, that fosters a culture of cutthroat competition
But at an L6 level you should have some laggards, or maybe you need to move the bar up
do you need to move the bar up?
at what point is the bar too high?
I think that's more why I chased them, because content was locked behind doing them
when you set the bar so high that when you hire anyone new due to turnover, they fail?
I mean, lets settle on the simple fact that the bar drifts up over time.  The expectations on you are higher than they were for your great grandfather
I never met my great grandfathers
I'm still saying that average person today has a higher bar to hit than people 4 generations ago
If the bar is drifting up then the competencies need to be reviewed
wayfair wasn't around 4 generations ago
so it's a moot point
:burn:
I'm saying I have a basic assumption, if you do not agree with that our wayfair convo is moot too
Though I think wayfair's small company attitude is pretty much gone now
Oh yea, that died off about the time I got hired
It's very clever-making though
Yea, I'm not quite sure how we can say we're "fast moving" when it takes me changing 12 files to add a single checkbox field
In related news, does anyone have Xbox Game Pass for PC? Not sure if I pimped it here or not
I do not
but I have a PC
sell me on it
I have it. I had Xbox live gold before anyway. Game pass gets all new Xbox exclusives for free. Also a ton of other games, a good number of which are actually good
There's a way to get 4 moths for $2
There are a ton of actually really good games on it
like?
ah yea, we talked about it
<https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games?=pcpopular> is a good start, but things like:

Frost Punk
Gears 1-5
Forza Horizon 4
Halo MCC
The Outer Worlds
Enter the Gungeon
Subnautica
Rage 2
Cities Skylienes
Slay the Spire
Ori and the Blind FOrest
SUPERHOT
Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice
Pillars of Eternity
A Plague Tale
BLoodstained
Dead Cells
Kingdom Come
Mutant Year Zero
Prey
Shadow Tactics
Void Bastards
Those are most of the ones I'm interested in (but not all)
I probably wouldn't play most of those
Whether or not I'll do the $5 a mo. sub or not is questionable. But I have it till May for $2, so I can't really complain
I've played at least a few games that I've seen before but been like "that looks fun, but I don't think I'll buy it"

And then have a great time
they also changed bonus to be 'weighted' so rating in winter 2020 matters more that summer 2019
That seems odd. 
it seems telling
But telling of what?
I'm no snitch
Yeah, I really think bell curves are bad for business. Sometimes everybody is doing what you expected of them, and if someone isn't, be critical of them or take action to replace them.
I've found less and less time for games. I frankly have that list of games and think it'll take me 10 years to get through them
Occasionally I spend some money on a steam sale, and that's how I increase my collection
Aysh the reason they did that is because of the change to raises.  They set it up where raises only come from Summer and no longer winter so now everything has to be year in review
but extra emphasis on Winter review
so- hiring freeze + enforcing rating curve + reduction in bonuses
Yea, if you don't play too many games, there's no real reason for it. But if you do, it's a great way to play a bunch of quality games
Also, re: The Umbrella Academy. You might know this already, but the original comic it's based off of was written by the lead singer of My Chemical Romance
My brother gifted me an oculus quest and i havrent opened the box. it got delivered 9 days ago.
I've heard it's a pretty darn good entry-level VR headset
Yea, I've heard good things about it. I wish I still had room for my Vive... I miss that thing
I've been considering getting an index. I have a jankey controller and a stained lense
I'd love to get an Index too, but can't really justify it even if I had space. Mainly cause the Vive is still good enough*
Yeah... I have not yet actually tried a headset better than the Vive. If I do I don't think I'll be able to resist buying a new one
Soooooo all your saying is that we're actually acting like a fortune 500 company now?
CJ :smile:
I went to a place called The Void - there's one in NY, but I went to the one at Disney Springs California. <https://www.thevoid.com/dimensions/star-wars-vr/>

THAT VR was kind of mind blowing. You wore a backpack, but the resolution was fantastic, the FoV was great, and the finger tracking was so cool. You could see your fingers move in real time with no sensors or anything. And you could see the other people you were with and interact with them and the environment
It was expensive for a short experience, but totally worth it
Someone pucked in the redline today....and someone wasn't paying attention and stepped in it :barf:  it was not me as an FYI. It was so gross
Oh, that's unfortunate
That's sad
It would be a shitty way to finish a Monday
I having no idea the concept of this site just assumed it was based on Resident Evil
Good morning everyone.
I just want to complain about being really fat right now............... everything hurts!!!
At least it is temporary!
site?
had you considered that before having babby start growing in your tummy?
Good Morning Mei
you'll live sweetie
Sorry, was late. Concept of this show
Ah, okay. Yea, it has nothing to do with RE haha
I could see where you could get that from though
Did we remove polly?
maybe?
It still shows up in the apps. Simple poll had a limited number of votes per month at one point
If it runs out of votes again we do
Stop making so many polls then!
I made one
2
Oh way
Goddess of chaos
Please go vote in game-night schemes though
Do we need polls?
:one: Yes
:two: No
:three: You don't know what we need, shut up
:-redacted-:
Hehehehehehe
looking to plan a ski trip on some weekend in the next month or two

<@UDBGH9BMX> I didn't ask for it.
join if you're interested
<#CT74J325S|ski-trip-planning>
join if interested
Summon the siilent
She's very against this whole process
Summon the silent
current situation prevents me from going
lunch time
well you can't ski; doesn't mean you can't travel
in this one, the destination matters more than the journey :pray: :meditation:
enjoy the food/fireplace/snow
i like lunch meetings because it gives me an excuse to eat earlier
are you renting a cabin?
unsure what form it will take
I eat whenever because I'm fat
I'm renting lodging of sorts
I'm currently on a self-imposed intermittent fasting diet
I try not to eat between the hours of 8pm and noon
why??? what kind of abuse is this?
I already lost a few pounds from it
and I already don't eat breakfast
I used to eat lunch around 11:30am
so I moved that by half an hour
I just cut out eating after 8pm
&gt; Weight loss studies of intermittent fasting have typically investigated the 5:2 diet or alternate day fasting interventions lasting three to six months. For most people in such studies, it takes two to three months to lose 10 pounds.
but you can still eat whatever you want unlike keto and such
Calorie restriction is pretty much the key to it
im trying that too, which is why i need an excuse
disagree
I agree with CJ
most studies had under 50 participants the last i checked
All the studies say you're wrong brenden
Most diets give you _effective_ means to control your calorie intake.  So whatever works for you works for you.  Not to say you shouldn't have variety in your diet
that is one method of dieting CJ
fasting gets you into a low insulin state where instead of burning food, you're burning energy stores
Which is the exact same claim as Keto
I know a lot of people who fast for ramadan- they  lose no weight.
I'm willing to bet that if you religiously measured your calorie intake pre and post you would notice a calorie intake decrease
I mean, I ate lunch and dinner before
I eat lunch and dinner now
I just moved dinner earlier and lunch later
I'm interested
quantity hasn't really had a material change
<@UE2D3HCBW>
<@UEA7LHFQS>
I mean if you wan to believe that intaking the same amount of food, but just changing hours makes you lose weight you're welcome to that thought process
But he's going off of him losing some weight already.
With no other variable change
anecdotal, but it's my experience
It has seemed to me that nutrition in general is inexact per person. Like, we don't have it as nailed down as we've preached we have for years.
Like calorie in - calorie out definitely works for me. I've also seen people be really really restrictive on that and make less progress than me. Usually women.
I think starting weight also matters here
like it's a lot easier for someone 60 lbs overweight to lose 10 lbs than someone 10 lbs overweight
Indeed. I'm very curious as to how many studies there are where calories are kept the same between people but then other factors come into play.
Like is Keto simply calorie restriction? The way Dakota describes it, most things he eats now are low calorie, so is it all just a fancy way of cutting out the high calorie carbs?
Or is there more to it than that
<@UETS9HTSS> is there a script or something for the he/she brings you emotes?
or do people do all those by hand?
My cousin did it religiously and it's a fancy way of cutting carbs
If you follow it really strictly, some days he struggled to get to 2k because it's all really dense really filling foods
If you mean the actual image creation, those are done by hand, though simple
yeah, the image creation.
Ohhh and drew, my comment is not that Brenden isn't being successful or that he did make this change, I think it's more a case of not measuring incidental changes.  You eat later in the day, now you don't have a mid day snack, you don't have a snack after dinner those things give you the net calorie lost.  Not I changed from eating at 11:30 to 12:00
I never did much snacking between meals
never did much is not the same as I don't snack (which is what you're probably doing now)
This is very depressing to read...... Just eat whatever you want and lose weight by getting prego in the beginning... ;p
Till you start to balloon when the you stop puking daily
shut up
fatty
I won't be alone much longer!
go lose weight, you have less than 7 months!!
It's soooo hard with you around, you're so needy
Need a workout buddy CJ?
I have a tough mudder to train for
Yea, but where are going to do that?
You can be in the tough mudder too if you want
I always debated on doing one of those things, my hatred of distance keeps me from signing up
It's way easier than just running 11 miles, at least from the cardio side of things. I tell people that if they can run a mile, they'll be fine
The obstacles break up the distance really well
Better question how long does it last
I like the new rando bot
Like 3-4 hours
See that's where you lose me, my attention span is like 2 hours max
Well the on the course stuff is only about 2 hours
maybe then
The other hour is parking, registration, and then hanging out afterwards grabbing your beer and whatnot
You would enjoy it
when is it?
alksjdf;lkjaslkdjflasl;djfaksdljflasjlkdfljjalksdf
just got a $351 flight for $81.29
Where to?
New Orleans to Boston
Nice
HOW
well, I had an $81.29 flight on a wednesday to go to new orleans, and hadn't booked the return because it was expensive
they rescheduled my flight there a few hours earlier
and offered to change my flight if it inconvenienced me
the web UI only lets you pick the same departure/arrival city
so I called and they booked my return on sunday (the expensive day) for the price of the wednesday flight
<@UDDE5960N> change my to his
also, <@UDDE5960N> can we capitalize Brenden?
that too
I can't get it to capitalize, dunno why
Aysh is impressed at the thriftyness
So did you pay $81.29 for the full round trip? Or each leg is that price?
one way
I rebooked the same flight there for $115 this time
so I paid $197 instead of $433 for the round-trip
Yeah, still a great deal!
Flexible at the moment. There's a Boston one in July
3 month old + Wedding planning sounds painful....
<@UETS9HTSS> Not sure if I ever said this, but the beef jerky came out really well, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
I completely forgot to stop by at some point and get it.......
Why you going to NLO?
Bachelor party
It's sitting on my counter cj
Finders keepers! If I get to it first can I claim it :P
No to July event too much going on
Destination and the journey sucks too
It is delicious, thank you so much Brenden!
Good morning!
<@UETS9HTSS> avoiding the plague by flying to NOLA

<@UDTR9SLN4> making on point StarCraft references with emoji
I appreciate the custom Good Morning :sun_with_face:
It's how it started before summon the silent became a thing. The original purpose of summon the silent was a manual chaos seed
Ahhhhh I see. Cool
Came in early for a meeting. Other guy's train is delayed like 45 minutes.
another medical emergency on the T
Which line?
Commuter
Good to know, sucks for you though
Leave early then?
I don't know what StarCraft reference I made, but I'm glad it was on point!
For the record, i showed Will he has been tagged in this skiing thread and he nodded and smiled and asked 'are you going? and that was it.
:aysh: :stirring_the_pot:
Not very successfully!
For the record,  *Aysh* showed Will he has been tagged in this skiing thread and he nodded and smiled and asked 'are you going? and that was it.
UGH
Question for the people here, there's a massive argument in non-work politics about free speech
Thoughts on being able to shout in a public space about whatever dumbass thing you want
:thread: :start_a_thread: :thread:
<@UK7V13DS7> <https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/my-11-month-old-babys-hr-discrimination-complaint?fbclid=IwAR3VF98DWE-bxfzTYhHQneoPrnEu12XX84yTom-1A94b-Dht3Zb3gk78jNM>
wtf..........
What do you mean?!!?!
It's great!
Our daughter is gonna have all the same complaints and threats
Public? Sure do what you will. I'm not sure I agree with the free speech on college campuses though (depending on whether or not those are considered public or private)
Public colleges are public space as they are funded by the public
We use to have this guy I called jesus man
It was hilarious
Ah, but if you are a student, then I think you waive the right to just shout whatever you want, unless you want to get kicked out
That seems silly, because you pay for an education suddenly you have less rights?
I see it like at will employment
Your idea of what I get for paying concerns me
If you are a student, I would imagine it would come with restricitons while you are on school grounds
If you wanna go across town and sew chaos, fine.
But if you belong to the school, DOOM TO YOU!
Nah, it only restricts what you can do ON CAMPUS
But a random hobo is totally cool
That's the part of this I'm struggling with
No, but the school as nothing to take away from him
If it were private property, then yeah call the cops and get him out
The cool doesn't _have_ to take your money. If they don't like what you are doing, why shouldn't they be able to kick you out
Just because someone has leverage over you doesn't mean they should be allowed to use it.  You don't have to work for Wayfair, but they certainly shouldn't be allowed to fire you because you're male.
You literally signed a contract saying that they could fire you for literally any reason
So yes, they should be able to fire you because you're male
As long as that is clear when you are coming in, then it's your fault for signign on
but gender is a protected class or whatever
so they can't fire you because you're male
Which I think is dumb
Though that is because it is a publicly traded company right?
you think it's silly that your manager can't fire you because of your gender?
no dakota, that's because you're employed in the USA
No it's literally a protected class, they can't do it because your in the US
and the company has over 10 employees
Not even employed, you're not allowed to refuse business because of gender
It applies to most employers engaged in interstate commerce with more than 15 employees, labor organizations, and employment agencies.
If I run a business, I don't see why i cant choose exactly who I want to work for me
if you run a business with 14 people, you can
It's the same as free speech the US gov guarantees you these things
14 seems so arbitrary
It's more so saying you should base it upon things that actually matter
it's not a quota
just that you can't blanket deny every woman that applies for the position because they're women
why is that bad?
Dakota is such a libertarian
wtf is a libertarian?
you like free will
Everything is ok to do because people will self correct away from the bad things
&gt; Libertarianism, or libertarism, is a collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle. Libertarians seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy, emphasizing freedom of choice, voluntary association and individual judgement.
So I got 14 people, all male cuz they were firends or something. If I wanna hire a 15th, I can't refuse women to avoid a potentially awkward workplace?
Technically you just show that the male candidate is superior to the female.  But you can't go "Jill, nope no women allowed"
Which studies have shown are not the case, but it's really hard to prove
no dakota, that would be against the law
it's just hard to prove
Yeah that's pretty dumb.
then you end up with hundreds of businesses that decide they don't want to hire any of 'the gays'
and suddenly gay people don't have jobs
you okay with that?
Ummmmm that can happen Brenden, sexual orientation is not a protected class
well fair
fine, replace gay with jew
I'm good with this
I do not think there should be laws preventing that
how about the disabled?
or veterans?
Nope. Still don't think laws should prevent that
You're not going to convince him Brenden
like wayfair getting sued because a blind person couldn't browse their website. why is that even possible
that's a completely different issue
woah.
unexpected. sorry.
That is oddly specific
thanks CJ
Welcome!
at was me
it's the same sort of issue though.
?????
:homer-disappear:
Reasonable accommodations
Discrimination of customer vs discrimination of employee
nah, you can be much more selective of your employees than your customers
you actually vette them and pay your employees
Yea, you're not allowed to discriminate against either
you just want the money from your customers
Reasonable accommodations
This is why Drive through ATMs have braille
I am gonna start a business with an all female workforce in protest against discrimination of women in the workplace, but oops, the business got big enough that 14 people isn't enough, guess the business can't grow anymore
protesting discrimination of women by discriminating against men isn't a good way to solve problems
I just want to say this convo decayed hard from it's original purpose
<@UDC03KCGK> I can't wait for you to weigh in
I'm not trying to solve problems. I'm saying you should be allowed to do so
Back to the original point: If you are attending a school, and your actions do not follow the school's values, they should be able to not accept you back.
I mean technically it was student specific, it was should be allowed to say loudly whatever you want in a public space
Short of inciting violence
so if the school's policy is that black people get extra homework because they're stupid and need more reinforcement, you're okay with this?
like you have no qualms with discrimination?
The chaos has spiraled out of control in our thread
/roll d20-2
Well fuck
I am saying a school like that would face public ire and likely not succeed. I don't think it should be enforced by the government
this is gold
Yea it's great the threat with grandma was on point too
I certainly would not want to attend a school with policies like that, but I have no issues with a school with policies like that existing. I am talking about universities, not public schools in this case. State run schools would obviously be restricted by government policy
Dammit redactions not letting me edit
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Public universities are state run schools, not sure if you wanted to edit that or not
Yeah something like that. Anything that is state run or gets state funding are excluded from my arguments, as that funding would come with restrictions
so we revert back to :village-pitchfork: and :village-torch: days where people take up their ire with the establishment that's inciting said ire?
Free speech yo
because now there's no recourse for them to go to since the government has no authority
The fact that public schools do exist means there is recourse
don't go to the damn racist school
I also acknowledge that we are likely better off due to these laws, I still think they are dumb
Should the post office be allowed to hire or fire anybody they want? No. Should Wayfair? Yes
I like the way Dakota is like, do we need this yes, is it stupid yes
my face deserves to be in the front of  your eyes
If you could sleep 4 hours less a night (and still function the same level you do currently), but have to work 2 more hours a day, would you do it?
Do I have to keep my current job?
I feel like the amount of hours I put in already maxes out my focus
But I would love another 2 hours to my day.....
I'd rather go 2 fewer hours of sleep for 2 more hours to my day
1. You'd pretty much be the same person, just with 4 more hrs a day (but 2 more work hours)
I'd do 1 more work hour, but not 2
2. This doesn't take focus into account, it's 2 hrs more regardless (though you can't explicitly plan to slack off)
but I always slack off
So you'd do 1 more hr, not 2, even tho it'd get you the same amount of extra end of day time? It's a better ratio than most work/not work you currently have
I'd do 1 hour of work for 3 hours of me time
lol
There is very little I will say no to if I get to sleep 4 hours less per day
That's an interesting stance, why do you not want to sleep?
Yes. I want more time whatever that means
I’m finally on a new orange line!!
None of the electronics are on. Hm. 
Calibration has broken aysh
It sounds pretty bad. 
Why? Also quarter to 9?
Two days of five hour meetings followed by three hours of discussion and nothing to say for it so I'm just tired
oof
Can't say I'm shocked
Is calibration almost over at least? How much do you have left?
Like another week or so right?
for me yes, but L3 is today and so on...
Im tired
What is life
Life is suffering
So today is your day of judgement! Let thee who judges be judged!
my parents went to a future prediction astrologer person who told them 'your daughter will give up and change her mind and do what you ask from april 14th' and my parents triumphantly sent it to me as something to celebrate :smile:
But what would you give up and change your mind of?
:shrug:  who  knoes- I am their petulant obstinate child still
*knows
Huh. That is... seems bad. 
please find me after april 14 and check  on me :smile:
will do. :slightly_smiling_face:
Will see if you're easier to manipulate, I'm always looking for more minions
Used the :lurker: emoji which is a StarCraft unit
Shocker! Aysh is a pain in the ass
:disappointed:
oh im hella easy to manipulate
Atrology person also says I will face 'Betrayal by friends' so IM WATCHING YOU ALL!
Does Secret Hitler count?
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
because I've already betrayed you
Sounds like a game of secret hitler/avalon needs to happen!
You are all evil!
I feel like Aysh would be the betrayer though
PURE EVIL
also- what do we know about Avalon? Mayne the resistance is actually bad and the current goverment is good
I can always work with easier
Isn't that actually the state of the game...?
Arthur is a English King. Morgana/Mordred are basically Welsh nationalists resisting a foreign power.
Let's find a way to turn this into a genie's curse. "be careful what you wish you" type deal.
who is arthur?
what is the foreign power is......MURICAH!
Brilliant!
Is this where aysh becomes super needy?
you could re-skin the game for Brexit. "All the PMs say they are working for the referendum, but the bill keep failing for some reason. Secret remainers."
I think you mean god king Trump right?
Who is god King Trump, ruler of MURICAH!
god emperor
You're right that's a better title
Think I can get what Dakota is saying...
Though to add to the argument, I think it is dumb, or at the very least naive. A lot of "the market will correct for that" arguments are completely blind to what actual practice is. In short, yeah, people will just discriminate again on things that shouldn't matter when hiring an employee.
Its a 40K reference. I've seen it pop up a fair bit on insane trump supporter stuff
As for what CJ's original question was, I think I'm missing a bit of context. Why are we talking schools specifically?
I don't think I've seen you petulant yet. guess I'm just lucky. :)
"o r i g i n a l"
The politics channel was talking about free speech in schools
School's specifically colleges tend to get most of the loud protesty people.  It's not meant there specifically
Yea but the god emperor in 40K is psychic and sleeps
Linkin Park in the End?
Also WHERE ARE MY SPACE MARINES THEN!?!?!?!
you mean space force?
`In short, yeah, people will just discriminate again on things that shouldn't matter when hiring an employee.` Which should be fine, because as a business owner, you should be able to hire whoever the hell you want :slightly_smiling_face:
No I mean my genetic super soldiers who act like religious zealots
Yeah, I would work the additional 2 hours. Though I'm working a very different schedule than you all.
I don't know 40k all that much. mostly the words god emperor, space marine, and "blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne".
and space goblins?
Weird thread
ORK BOYZZZZZZZZ
Blood for the blood god I think refers to the chaos marines
The crazy zealots that turned against the god emperor and a stain on the empire
Well that's where the argument is. Discrimination at that level creates entire problems for society as a whole.
I mostly just love how crazy religious that world is
I honestly think businesses are afforded more freedoms than citizens themselves in this country, and that is a major backwards system to what I think a country is there for. If you disagree with that, there's not a whole lot either of us can say to each other that convinces them against that. It's close to a fundamental belief.
:lol: I see a country as no more than a large business
I would like to say I see the country as a large mafia organization, not a large buisness
So you agree with me
because those two things are the same
I would disagree with the mafia and a business being the same thing.  The Mafia runs businesses but is not a business itself
I view it "by the people, for the people" and don't think mafias or businesses run themselves like that. Businesses often run themselves for the sake of the business itself
No government is actual by the people for the people
Wait, <@UHQD9J1SL>, you're L4+? I feel like we talked about this...
I thought Aysh was only an L3....?
Me too, but I thought only L4s do calibration stuff...? And wasn't she talking about how today is L3 day?
My boss told me when my calibration was.  Also depends on team, some L3s will be included in sub L3
:ah_hmm:
OMG NO, Im L3
I have L1/ L2 reports so I was involved in their calibrations
Hence why she's being judged today
There will be discussion around her merits and demerits
And given the fact her boss is gone I'm expecting a solid 3, unless her boss's boss really knows her well
My boss's boss is an L6 and does NOT know me well :confused:
Exactly, so very few will be capable of judging you which makes you "average"
But threes are just the bees knees
no, considering the forced curving that means Inconsistent :confused:
Nah that's including forced curving
No one can argue you're incompetent because know one knows what you do
:smile:
having been in calibrations, thats not how it has been going :confused:
Your team is terrible then
'my team' is engineering yo
"No one can speak to this person's competency, perfect TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST THEY GO!"
These look like they should be a card game. You have a green power to play on your side, or red to play an your opponent.
I play Fun, red side, on your DBA, lose two productivity points.
Where the fuck did this come from?
My mind
too professional for that
That would be hilarious game, tech corp
Build the best tech company
First company to afford a ping-pong table and kegs wins.
Are there any "tech startup" themed board games?
Seems like it'd actually be pretty fun
First one to IPO wins
probably at least one. I don't know that I'd bet on there being any good ones.

Wow those games a vicious
there was a 'shark tank' type game on jackbox where you have to create a product and pitch it- does that count?
sure
&gt; Euro theme, ameritrash mechanics and the esthetics[sic] of an abstract. Not the greatest combination I say...
I really wasn't a fan of the rapping one. It felt really slow.
much easier to make a bad game than a good one. especially if you think a novel flavor will help people paper over the other flaws.
That's cause people are bad at life
I'll sell it on name rather than value!
same
i loved the trivia game but jyo and niki hated it
was it like Fibbage? or just a straight trivia game?
From what I can gather, making board games is hard
And there's very little money in it
There's probably decent money in it, just low margins
gotta be German. they buy so many
I'm assuming if you could figure out how to market them successfully you'd make so much money
Cause really the only marketing i ever see is referral or BBG
or pax
We just need some billionaire to claim that _Schotten Totten_ taught them all their skills. like how the business world goes wierd for Sun Tzu or chess every now and then.
Or replace the DNC debate with a game of Scythe
Chess, Monopoly, and Risk are a real problem. All the games most people know suck.
Business world loses it's mind over the next big thing
You don't like Chess????
chess is crazy boring
and to be good at it you have to study it like a profession
its not something you acn pick up and find the fun
I would argue that any game with perfect information that exists as long as chess will end up in the same place
possible. although there are things that can help. Onitama has many fewer moves in a game. Taking 15 minutes is so much better than 2 hours. You can iterate quickly, feel like you're learning.
also, each game of it feels very different. It'd be hard to commit a list of openings to memory.
Chess makes the study necessary.
Yea but you're talking about playing professionally vs. causally, that's not a fair comparison at all
I'm saying playing chess casually is no fun. playing onitama casually is.
chess is not set up to be casual.
its a long slog where its really easy to shoot yourself in the foot quickly and not see it until later.
So onitama is fun because when you do something bad you fail immediately?
yeah. you get feedback, and when you play multiple times in a row you feel like you're getting better. Its like super meat boy.
I actually like go, even though its longer. Since it feels like you're managing multiple fields, you know a mistake is costing you, but it feels like there is a chance to recover elsewhere
Yea, I actually really dislike Chess. Just never been fun to me. It's actually part of the reason that I didn't think I liked board games till shortly before I started at wf
I don't know what to make of your stance doug.....
when is the last time you chose to play chess?
4 months ago???
It's mostly because people I spend time with don't play it
was it fun?
I was teaching it to someone, so yea
Hard but fun
oh, I should have excluded teaching.
last time you played chess against someone else who knew chess
years
if you poke around nonwork I'm sure you can find someone to play with.
There's an entire group
I could if I wanted to, yes and I chose not to.  Is it because it's not fun, no it's because there's other things I prioritize more
Some people enjoy chess. I won't say it's not fun for some people. But I was just never a fan of it
have you played go?
Which is fine to each their own
Possibly without realizing it
no, you'd know if you havd
Unrelated:
Someone I work with has been feeling crazy sick for the past week. Went to Urgent Care today and got 4 different prescriptions. Pretty much just a bad case of the flu.

I ask him:
&gt; Did you get your flu shot this year?
His response:
&gt; No
&gt; I am against them
me_irl: :mind_blown:
I should get a go board.
oh crap, I forgot to get a flu shot this year
yup
I mean I just don't bother with something that's only 33% successful
better than 0%
But that's me, I'm sure with the little one I should
It's highly recommended by pretty much everyone who deals with diseases. And even if it's the wrong strain, it still tempers the effect if you DO get it
I'd enjoy skipping 1 out of 3 flus
And it's free almost everywhere...
also heard immunity. we don't do it for ourselves, we do it for others
I don't disagree with all the things you said, I still have to go _do it_ and I'm too lazy for a 33% chance of success on something I rarely catch
Pretty sure I just walked into Hammock/Credenza one day, they poked me in the arm, and then I left
unless you forgot this year, like me.
I did that, but didn't have my insurance card of me, meant to go into CVS later, and didn't.
I'm not saying don't get one, I'm just saying I don't bother with it
Don't want to get into the libertarian discussion again, but it's also kinda selfish to intentionally not get one because of herd immunity and immunocompromised people
nice
I don't get flu shots because I hate needles
They do have needle-less ones too, tho they are more difficult to get
But still, just pretend it's not a needle
It's not like you even really feel it
Dave, the flu vaccine doesn't give herd immunity because the flu is not well understood. So this is not like small pox, or polio.  And we've already discussed that even if it did do that, it only works works 1 out of 3
So the odds of me both catching it and it being effective are close to 0
It's more important for me to make sure my immune system is functioning well
I have not heard of the needle-less ones. How does that work?
```But still, just pretend it's not a needle```
hard pass
<https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/news/20181130/what-herd-immunity-and-how-does-it-protect-us>
<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/jet-injector.htm>
No fucking shit dave I know what herd immunity is
uhhh still no. `A jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle.` doesn't sound any better
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/upshot/flu-shot-deaths-herd-immunity.html>
&gt; Dave, the flu vaccine doesn't give herd immunity because the flu is not well understood
That's said to be directly false in the articles I linked
Also, it has an effectiveness of 40-60%, not 30%
<https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2019-2020.htm>
It's the star trek thing. And it looks really cool
better then it's been
My stat was old and probably included the 2004-2006 season which was 10 and 20
I'm curious - do you have a reason for a fear of needles, or is it just a general phobia?
I'm still of the opinion that at my age and health, me being a vector is low
you know Jack
I don't think I've played that. but I do always like trivia.
generally sucks that the T stops when it does, otherwise I'd hang out longer when we do these things.
taxi cab
Yeah, next time. 
I have had a couple really bad experiences with nurses taking blood and being unable to find a vein.
It is less of a phobia of needles, and more of a "I dont trust them to not fuck up"
If it makes you feel any better, I think it's almost impossible to mess up the flu vaccine
Unfortunately not. I'll go get shots or blood drawn if I really need to, but a flu shot doesn't fall into that category.
_should_ or even _really should_ are not good enough
I am feeling unloved
I have friends outside of chaos monkey, CJ
For the record Dakota it's the same as getting misted and having your skin absorb it
So way less scary
<@UDDE5960N> God loves you child
Friends? Outside of Chaos? Does...not...compute...
CJ, you have a wife
You have no lived until a series of nurses have burst enough veins in your arms that they have to try to find the ones in your hands
I have decided to rename her to Goddess of Cranky pants time
Also she's really upset that I call her mommy instead of wifey
then call her wifey. easy fix
Well she's not yet a mom, she's a future/soon to be mom
Pretty sure that's the opposite of living Victoria
That's literally trying to die
either way, she's not your mom
No but she's my baby's mommy which is generally the context that I use it
eh, people calling their wives mom kind of creep me out
thats the only way the baby will know to call Mei Mommy and not Wifey
also, who says Wifey,
My Dad called Mom by her first name. We still learned to call her mom.
I dunno, it happened to me and I was not trying to die, I was just trying to get an infusion of meds
My father also uses my mother's first name
Asians Aysh, in the pursuit of all that's cute
but wifey is cring, not cute
Aysh, do you consider yourself asian?
you know Aysh is Asian, right?
Pretty sure that referring to the munchkin in front of the new munchkin will not go over well
haha, Brenden and i collided there a bit
NO, I AM NOT CUTE !
lol not East Asian - but thats what I have to fill out in official forms
:pinching-hand:
well you lived and that's good enough for me!
You're right Aysh, you're not cute, YOU'RE FREAKING ADORABLE!
and that was the last they ever saw of CJ
RIP CJ
Lol :joy:
What is living?
I thank thee on behalf of all Asians on Earth!
Aysh, would you rather be cute or average?
trying to figure out how much you hate being called cute
Pretty sure it's breathing
<@UDC4QL95G> every time I need to get an IV in, they try my left inner elbow multiple times, fail, then go to my right inner elbow, then fail again, then just go with the back of one of my hands
WTF is wrong with you people!?!?!?
I have inherited the trait of small and easily movable veins
Yeah <@UETS9HTSS> that pretty much sums up what happened to me. The nurse was really fond of literally digging around with the needle when she couldn't find it. After that I lost all trust
I've had nurses since then that have no trouble drawing blood
I dont hate it :shrug:
Dev Box issues :angrybork:
Not replicating the issue in Prod
Or just not work?
Copied from something I said in another chat:

&gt; tfw you can't figure out what's wrong with your code. Nothing is working even though it should. You ask in your coworker, you ask in the sf purchase eng channel and there's no good answer. Your manager's manager comes over and looks through it and can't see anything wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Turns out it's a dev box issue. :shrug-dog-intensifies-more:
Nice
Something that should work in Dev doesn't
yea, and other people have had similar issues with the variable, which is what made me think I was doing something wrong. But they were unrelated to this
Ohhhh extra fun undocumented issue
And this boys and girls is why I like analytics, data goes in data comes out
EASY PEASY LEMON SQUEEZY!
DEV


BOX
This is what I think Dave would do to his dev box if he could
Yall see the coronavirus email?
yea what about it?
It says "Don't be a dumbass"
we're all gonna die!
We're not gonna die Dakota
• Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
• Discuss travel to China with your healthcare provider. Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues may be at risk for more severe disease.
• Avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, and products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat).
• Avoid contact with sick people.

```Avoid contact with sick people.```
Right it's "Don't be a dumbass"
Not that kinda of sick Aysh
Guess you all should stop talking to me
We like you for that sickness
:stuck_out_tongue:
Google say lethality rate is 2%
about the same as driving i guess :stuck_out_tongue:
*driving when I'm also on the roads
Yea I was gonna say my rate is way lower than 2%
Read email. Spontaneously developed a cough. Guess im the 2%
:rip:
I donut rage really
I dunno, one of my personal failings is I don't do big, outwards displays of emotion that much
OMN POOR TIGGERRRRR
lol
Gotta get stabby buddy LET IT ALL OUT1
wait, how does "tapped and attacking" work
would being tapped prevent the attack?
they are created both tapped and attacking.
since they are technically created after the declare attackers phase
normally you tap when you declare attackers
What is the need to say they are tapped then? Don't you tap attacking creatures unless they have that one keyword after the attack anyway?
OH I got order of operations mixed up
1. Declare attackers
2. Tap them
3. Trigger
4. new cats created, are tapped and attacking
Silence Chaos Seed
too late
How does making new creatures work in Magic?
also, why didn't that work?
Do you have to whip out that card
token cards
He did it too late
or you use dice or whatever
Chaos seed posting is what records a thread as ineligible for chaos seed, and reactions only happen for eligible threads
ah, makes sense. forgot I had react only when something actually happened. good feature.
I'm sure this card is super weak, but it seems hilarious to me, and I would want it
its pretty strong. limited bomb
they just also did some cute artwork of some cat cards. This is not the original printing.
4 mana 4/4 that summons 2 1/1s on attack seems pretty good to me
ehhhhhh, I donut do fake reactions
with lifelink
With lifelink
are there cards that buff creatures when summoned?
or let you draw or someting. Or buff themselves when creatures are created
a bunch
the last 2 feel like they'd synergize better
King of the pride seems especially good due to the lifelink
Lifelink = heal for the damage you deal If I am not mistaken
Wasn't that... Simic's archytpe in RTR?
that wants constantly bigger creatures. a constant stream of 1/1s will only trigger that Krasis once
I was just about to say the same thing
Yea, I was talking about +1/1 counters
When things come into play
There are like 16,000 unique cards now. There are a lot of ways it could interact. Things that care about many creatures, about attacking, about life gain, about cats, about white mana symbols, about power, about toughness
Do the cat tokens count for devotion?
devotion counts mana symbols.
Seems pretty good to me. Card comes in 1/1 bigger than your biggest creature, and then draw that many cards?
but it's a turn 6 card right, how many turns does Magic generally go?
"Heliod isn't a creature" Is that good or bad
game of limited, 8-10
game of standard, 4-20
So I think dave's point is more, when you play this your near the end game
<@UDDE5960N> Leonin warleader is a 4 mana 4/4 card with a good affect. Imagine what 5 would look like with no good effect
unless you're playing commander
I have no idea what you're trying to get me to do
Other than the fact that I like Minion heavy decks
That is the most adorable card
^ that's what 5 mana gets you today
I mean... I have no way to assess their usefulness other than they sound neat
you start at 20. the turn after you play Oketra she could represent 9 damage at least. and is basically impossible to permanently remove.
Don't get the 9, double attack is only 6, zombies are 4
yup, typed wrong number
No worries, does vigilance mean attack? I figured it'd be more defense related
Vigilance means it doesn't tap to attack. so it can attack and block
Ohhhh snap! That's a fun key word
Also CJ isn't married yet...or did I miss something?
We had a whole argument where I'm "older" than him because I'm married, despite him about to be a dad.
Husband &gt; Dad
But Father &gt; Husband
Never learned Go, but would like to
Also I agree with everything being said about Onitama
Unless you don't have health insurance
So yeah, forgot to get mine this month
Also there's the bigger problem of anti vaxers
Also I clicked on Dave's articles... So I appreciated them...
The inside of your microwave, seems like it might be broken?
I can empathize with this in a weird roundabout way. I for a period between 16-19 years old gave blood away at like a clockwork rate of every 8 weeks. First time I gave blood was just a super positive experience, and the flobotomists (sp?) were all super nice because I have big, easy to see veins, basically the easiest patient they get all day. I would go to different towns to keep on the 8 week regularity, it was just my way of giving to charity. 
Had an old lady one time struggle, dug the needle around, and claimed I had difficult veins and wasn't her fault. I couldn't know any more that this was straight up false. 
So if there are people who can still fuck up drawing blood from me, I can only imagine how awful it is for those of you with bad experiences with this.
Na this is someone's freezer that was getting de iced
The likelihood of death by driving I think is actually surprisingly high. The rate of being in a collision is certainly very high.
Honestly, 4 mana for a 4/4 with upside is a good rate. Solid B+
This comment brought to you by "Limited Resources"
Would have to have a pretty interesting build for it to be good in constructed formats though
Why are you looking at deiced freezers this early in the morning?
They should be though, whether that is the reality in practice. Philosophically speaking, however idealistic that may be.
/roll 20
/roll d20
You shot and innocent bystander who was down range who then chased you for half a day with their monster truck. Lose 50 gp, and start the next combat cursed.
yea, I'm just too much of a realist to accept that any consolidation of power ever results in what's good for the masses.  Mostly because even the masses don't know what's good for the masses
wow that's harsh
It's a monster truck rally. Those people crush your car with you in it for less.
Although I guess this a punishment more in line with a natural 0
Ok, but why are you? :@
Good morning!
Don't give a fuck if half of you are already at work, the only time I find "Good morning" in appropriate is when I'm at work and don't want to remind the guest they are ordering a beer before noon. 
<@UHQD9J1SL> pentulent child who is now cursed by a random psychic

Doug, explaining the finer points or MTG to the masses
<@UDD45P5A9> fates have aligned that she might actually make it to game night again to meet people she talks to regularly for the first time. 
<@UPGVCMGD9> adoring cats
<@UDTR9SLN4> randomly walking into big conference rooms to voluntarily be attacked by needles. 
<@UE2D3HCBW> clearly still paying attention to this slack, without ever actually saying anything. Ultimate lurker
<@UEA7LHFQS> possibly dead
<@UJTEHPEPL> possibly the deactivated account I was told of
<@UDKJNRKHA> almost definitely the deactivated account I was told of.
You sure you wanna be adding people to the channel?
We just roll the dice.
This does seem evil
It's the whole reason we were exiled from <#CDBT6UTCL|game-night-schemes>
I love this good morning message~! May day drinking forever be prevalent and lucrative! Good morning!
you were WHAT? :smile:
Eh, it didn't ask me about Ben, and I was shocked Tyler's account popped up. Worth a shot
This channel exists cuz Doug didn't wanna put up with our antics
We were unable to filter our chaos back then
I see we have since broken Doug
This is very true
Always adoring cats 🥰
I think we won him over with Prometheus
We've actually made more chaos since doug joined
no0 Drew- its just that he isnt officially a dada yet. The timeline will grant him adultier-hood soon
Because we didn't have prometheus before
It was just us chatter inanely
Thanks Aysh! It's my way of showing I pay attention to the chat log even if I'm more often than not unable to participate as it is happening.
CJ- how do you feel about 'hubby'?
Was not yet in transit when this was posted
True, but a good deal of the chaos in this channel is controlled chaos via a bot.
Too much thinking
Currently in a lyft though
We don't have to be as inane since the bots do most of it for us
Which means your in transit now!
Also trying to think whether Drew said good morning to me when I was drinking yesterday
Nahhhhhhhh
stop calling me a bot- it hurts my feelings
:iseewhatyoudidthere:
Mei is sad because she'll be mommy before wifey and I told her Mommy supercedes wifey
Almost definitely not. Used to pay attention to my watch to know when to flip from "Good morning" to "good afternoon" at work, got one person who was like "Oh god, it is morning" and realized that I should never ever use that phrase again at work.
Mei pretty much calls me Honey, soooo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It's 5 o clock somewhere!
Yea but you're not inane just chaotic
hubby is on the same plan as wifey in my head
sp now your baby will also call you Honey?
yea.... good morning beer never sounds good
no baby will call me DADDY!!!!!
yes- , thats what i said
yea.... good morning beer never sounds good
Idunno, it's a pretty good way to get rid of a hangover
BUENOS DIAS!
I enjoy 11am good morning beer when I can open a brewery
I'd always rather day drink than night drink
????
Had my hangover by like 8pm
so you agree babies can understand contexual naming. so call Mei by the name that will stop making her mad at you.
And slept like a baby at 1am
:raised_eyebrow:
How so you 'can open a brewery'. I am only able to 'open a brewery can'
I arrive at a brewery tap room as it opens
" NO BABY SALL CALL YOU DADDY. ALL BABY SHALL CALL YOU HONEY"
Better?
wow, Aysh handing down curses
Daddy? I always called mine "Dad"
Babies do not understand contextual naming there's an entire learning about that from Sesame street, it's why blues clues repeated the same episode every day for a week.  Babies need repetition not rules.
the butter is too bitter
buy a bit of better butter to make the bitter butter better
So we can confirm that CJ and Mei didn't just go elope at the courthouse before the wedding ceremony? I'm just trying to keep terms straight
You are correct she refused to do anything before 8/8
Will you play games at your wedding CJ? :smile:
Probably not, it's all pomp and circumstance
Predictions/ Ideas for Mei and CJ's wedding! :thread:
That we can agree on. People don't like taking their medicine.
:raised_eyebrow:
I also think those threads back then somehow were longer, despite fewer people. "Chaos Monkey" technically started as just a group chat between CJ, Dakota, Dave, and me usually arguing about the optimal way to play a Tragedy Looper scenario.
Anyway, my opinion since I never gave it, is to give them the outlet not restrict them, but ignore them.  Nothing is so meaningful as letting hate run into indifference.  I think the currently rules of not inviting targeted and direct violence is good enough
Which was by far my most active "channel" at Wayfair.
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU MOVED THE GUY THE WRONG WAY DREW!!! (I love you and teasing you)
You know, I'm not sure how much actual alcohol I gave you now. Easy to measure the drinks themselves, but I also gave you samples of just about every random liquor or wine that got mentioned.
Which was by far my most active "channel" at Wayfair.
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU MOVED THE GUY THE WRONG WAY DREW!!! (I love you and teasing you)
If I'd been thinking on my feet could've gotten you the sample mezcal drinks I had to make...what a waste.
You were a better Mastermind than me. Though I can't remember if I did win a scenario straight up once, or only got close before Dave hail married the guess
Dave Hail Maryed the guess. I'm the only Mastermind with a win
This is back to the school speech part, yes?
Not businesses and discrimination?
Mostly because we're ruthless SOBs, if protags can trigger murders we do
And most likely drinking
Just the speech part yes
I'm really trying to remember, I thought I got one win off despite the hail mary
I miss that game. Need a Saturday session
As for the discrimination, I think Dakota is right because any time you codify rules people will find a way around it.  Like you hire black men, and white women, but not black women and be fine as protected classes do not protect intersections.  You need to give people a better way to fight back and to me that's UBI.
I can agree with that view then. When people cross over into directly inciting violence is when it to me is the same as "Fire!" in a crowded performance venue.
UBI?
In your defense, you went first and those are the "easier" scenarios for the Protags to win
Universal Basic Income
The hail mary one was later
Basically eliminates absolute poverty but not relative poverty
Agreed, but I'm more so saying that calling me better is not fair to you as i had "harder" scenarios overall than you did.  And my win rate was only like 50%
Which, in all honesty, the only thing I hated about it was his logic was based on game flavor. Which while completely correct, is what I hope scenario 9 does not rely on, because everyone should be a suspect, not just anime tropes
I need to research this more. I hear the term, but I need to dig into the actual economics of it.
I currently view it from an uneducated stand point of prices just rising from inflation again to render people poor again. Hence why I find minimum wage being increased to feel like a poor strategy.
To be honest, it's mostly theory crafting with a little bit of hard research.  My argument which I haven't really seen super articulated other than in the actual tests, is that it swings enough of the power back to the people that capitalist have to capitulate to the basics.
I volunteer as tribute
the reception should have board games and tables for guests to play
Minium wage hasn't kept up with inflation, which is more the problem.  And inflation as a concept is poorly understood (from everything I've read)
Like we know it happens, and we can measure, but we don't know what's causing it to happen
I got one of the mezcal drinks
Just not the other
Huh, worth a Google and an audio book
Yeah, but I had to make 2 more after the one I gave you. One was a repeat, sure, but I could have still given you drink itself that got poured down the drain
Inflation or UBI?
Ahh, understood
the 'first dance ' should be in Dance dance revolution
The winner will get to decide what CJ will call mei (Mommy or Wifey)
The tablecloths should have various board game setups on them (checkers, go, backgammon, etc) and the centerpiece should be a vase full of cheap game pieces used to play said games
I will invite you to come to the bar the day were having to do training on the new menu. Lots of drinks get made just to make sure we all make them correctly, and then no one knows what to do with them. Saw one of my regulars and went "Hey, want to try what's on the new menu?" And just gave it away
Mei will not go for any of this, although I love the idea
The cake should be a MINECRAFT CAKE
I WANT IN ON THIS SHIT!
I'm pretty sure when I was a local at a bar that happened more than once
i so wish you did something I would partake in :cry:
wedding to be streamed on twitch for those who cannot make it
We'll bring a card game and you can play with me, and win with greater and greater ease as the night goes on
Well, I did work at a bar that had food. You could've had the food there
The Registry should not be stuff CJ and Mei want, just different cash values.
I might consider taking off for that day
drinks should be called 'Manna shots'
Only if they're blue
that registry idea is valid  no matter who you are and what the event is
Make them red just to fuck with people
Nah those are health potions
Health potions can be green
Fuck that
The green ones give mana. The blue ones give both health and mana. 
At least in Zelda. Not Diablo
Purple give both
Which makes sense
Ubi, I know inflation already as a strong concept
Yes, but I'm trying to think of which games go which color. Figured CJ would appreciate the Zelda reference
The dangerous part is that doesn't count against my comp tab at all.
Count me in as well
What does the orange drink give
Usually a strength or other stat based buff like agility
a false sense of dance skills
Wouldn't that break Keto?
cheat days exist for a reason
Also this is the thread where I learned you don't drink Aysh
:open_mouth: but yeah, I do not
Going back to the wedding, this is something that I think would be really cool for a couple where both of them played a lot of games together. Like if two people from the games club got married.
Most likely, but I'd consider that enough of a special occasion. Board game nights on the other hand are regular things, so keeping to the diet on those is more important
Which also makes me realize I have no idea how CJ and Mei met...
Random friend
Speculation on how CJ and mei met :thread:
They met at a "i hate dairy" convention
"I hate dairy" convention
:raised_eyebrow:
That's your emoji of the day
CJ walked around meowing 'wifey....wifeyyyy' and Mei appeared from the heavens
I found it yesterday and it sums up so many good emotions
I usually spring for :doubt:
I totally forgot that mana is green in legend of zelda
Wizard of Oz screening!
Damn, well show up on a slow night like a Monday and I'll see about getting you Craigie Burger, chili fries, and then 3-4 very strong cocktails
Murder mystery mystery murder. 
decided to go on a blind date with my facebook stalker (CJ)
Dangerous
Was he in his peak shape back then? You've mentioned before you worked out a lot back in the day, CJ
Talk to mei
Wait, is Mei speculation how Mei and CJ met?
Do we take it as truth or prediction
I may do a harry potter theme :slightly_smiling_face:
:luffy_vomit:
He had a 6 pack at the time I met him. It went down hill from then. Only 1 pack now.
Notice the true power of wedding planning
"I may"
Not "we"
Bought how this works out
`May` -&gt; `Mei`
How many years ago did you both meet?
It's cause you make me fat
I eat sooo much more with you
Have you seen CJ trying to plan something? His idea of a wedding is to be lazy at home
LOL DOUBLE BOTTED
I mean that does sound pretty cheap
Oh no, but we haven't made the interaction work
My idea of wedding is signing some papers
Ahh the classic courtroom wedding
I eat sooo much more with you
Dakota are you trying to reverse psychology Mei into throwing the most low key wedding ever?
Have you seen CJ trying to plan something? His idea of a wedding is to be lazy at home
It's not happening
10 course meal here I come
LOL
Mie- did you fall for the other 5 packs? or this 1 pack?
I saw :ass: I at first I thought it was `beating a dead horse` but ass works too
Oh, I just realized Mei can drink at her own wedding!
about 5 years ago. I fell for the danger
Brilliant
A little bit
Mei doesn't really drink and when she does it's an abomination
CJ will swoon be known as 'CJ, Hubby of Mommy'
I eat sooo much more with you
Have you seen CJ trying to plan something? His idea of a wedding is to be lazy at home
Ah, well CJ can get back to that with some more working out and cutting out the snack wall and beer from work
My idea of wedding is signing some papers
Oh no, but we haven't made the interaction work
Dakota are you trying to reverse psychology Mei into throwing the most low key wedding ever?
Pshhhhh, I need to get back to doing 2 hours of exercise a day.  And that'll probably never happen again
It's not happening
CJ, Husband of Mother (or dragons?)
I am already doing as economical as I can :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
This is just evil...
SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAL PELASE DO A HP THEME WEDDING
Nah I was hoping i could somehow toss in a reference to the batteries I made cj buy on amazon
No it's CJ Husband of Dragon Mother of Rat
just naming your daughter after the year?
AKA dragon gave birth to a rat
I got used to referring to Sam as "my wife" way quicker than "her husband" and vice versa for her.
He need to start working out at least 3 hours a week
How many days a week was the 2 hrs a day?
I am the dragon :slightly_smiling_face: mother dragon hehehehe
4 to 5 generally
dragon mother of a rat
Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday with a smattering of other days for like an hour or so
Ah hell, you might have actually been born the year of the dragon too.
All I got was a fucking sheep :disappointed:
There was also a time I think i was doing an hour a day every day but sunday
FIRE BUNNY REPRESENTING!!!!
Hmm, yeah somehow I don't think even 3 hours a week is gonna get you back to that.
mother of parasite!
6 packs remind me of the segments on cockroaches that reminds me of dissecting cockroaches in schools which reminds me of the smell of formaldehyde
you dissected roachs in school?
:raised_eyebrow:
you didnt?
Nah. Just owl pellets and a frog
Frog and fetal pig. 
Can't remember If I did a pig, or if I just heard about the AP bio students doing it.
OH  GOD NO
We had a fetal pig per two people
awww man check out the nice swag they just added to the sketchy parsonskellog wayfair shop
Pretty whelming IMO
its nice thats its so cheap!
I'm not sure they could have possibly gotten more lazy with the mug in particular
I'm not sure it's even worth the $2
Someone in stupid questions stupid answers asking if ten am is too early to have a beer :smile:
I'd buy a wf mug for $2, just to have it
the WF logo doesn't even have all the colors
Color's cost money doug, you can't get more than 1 color at that price!
yeah sounds familiar
pack rat seems like if you don't deal with it quickly it would get rather out of control
You gotta spend 3 mana and discard a card to use the effect though
Discarding is kinda harsh
Turns out Pack Rat is in contention for best card ever in limited.
HA
I'm not saying it's bad, you just gotta build your deck around it. Need lots of mana and draw for it to take off by itself
Another way of looking at it is 3 mana for +1/1 to all creatures on board plus x/x for each creature
turns out not even. its just good in everey deck
Yea
I would argue it's not even discarding because you're playing another packrat and making every packrat better
it's like playing a normal minion with a buff
Except it's terrible by itself without other rats, or another source of rats
Me toooooooooo
5 mana + discard a card for 2 2/2 rats?
yup. still Hall of Fame level card
no other rats needed
But like direct message me because I don't read the full threads :)
cause it's 8 mana for 3 3/3 and 2 discards
which is still bad. What I didn't take into account is the fact that you can activate it's ability at the end of your opponents turn and spend the rest of your mana. each rat can also serve as blocker summon on command
CJ is a fire bunny, I am earth dragon, and this thing is a metal rat
owl pellets, frog, pig heart, crocodile for some reason
and a small pig
I think you mean epic drinking!
That's how they keep the cost low
What is Mei's idea of epic drinking?
What's with all the frickin owl pellets? Frog and a squid (coastal town, we made calimari out of them afterwards)
About 50% sugar, 45% soda, 5% alcohol
Is that the official store for Wayfair merch? It straight up looks like one of those sketchy discount warehouse sites I got my keyboard from.
Oh, so thats why Slack rebranded? Saving costs on marketing?
Yes to both the question and the statement
I guess???
They still have multi colors
It got quiet in here
I saw that. Did you see the line about how much it cost Bezos to buy the post?
YUP
its easier to forget just how rich the ultra-rich are
not the post- his 23 million dollar house
oh. The Post.
(this is all using salary of $97,300)
no NET WORTH
oh
yeah, big differnence. missed that
A LIKELY STORY
You say it got quiet, then when I am not quiet you all stay quiet
like what
Its Brexit day today.
I'm glad that we've decided
To eat the rich
Multipurpose, simple solution to a hard issue
But they had like 11. Now 4-5
Which all suck because the number of times I confuse Google Podcast with Slack are sad
Sorry Aysh, for some reason people decided to torture me in person
You know what the difference between a billionaire and a millionaire is? About a billion dollars
Did you know the 2 most populous countries in the world could lose a BILLION people each, and the order of most populous countries wouldn't change?
HAHAHAHAHAH, I guess so
Also color control is how your remembered
CVS has a brightish red, Wayfair is Purple, Nike is black
Apple is white
Snow is white
VS is baby pink
I didn't know that, no
I actually really like that
Have I ever told you guys about how I conceptualize wealth and the differences between minimum wage, my wage, and the super rich?
I read it online somewhere (reddit?) and since then, it's been my go to
Nope you have not as far as I know
I hope this one i saw it was fun
I KNOW RIGHT!
As soon as I heard it, i was like hahahaha, that's so true.... awww that makes me sad
Back in college, we used to frame how things cost by the number of 3DS's you could buy with the money. so minimum wage you save up for a 3ds, Daves wage you only buy things that cost X number of 3DSs or less, and buillionairs consider buying nintendo
how?
Tho it should be more specific, cause a millionaire COULD mean like, 500mm. But I still like it
Mine is something like that:
So, say you're currently making 100k.
Lunch in Back Bay is around $10 no matter where you go
I think in this context is 1 of each
This tool is fun to play with
<http://www.globalrichlist.com/>
So, say you're currently making *$100k* per year.
Lunch in Back Bay is around *$10* no matter where you go.

Then, imagine you're making minimum wage and making ~*$20k* per year. So, your earnings are 5x less than someone making 100k, effectively making things cost 5x as much. (I know, it doesn't scale exactly like that because of fixed costs, but it's close enough)
So, a Back Bay lunch would _effectively_ cost you *$50* (compared to if you earned 100k)*.* That's crazy - could you imagine having to spend $50 for lunch? You'd never eat out, except maybe on special occasions, you'd always pretty much _have_ to bring food from home
So lets inverse that and move to millionaires. Say you make $*1mm* per year. That's DOUBLE the difference between a software engineer and minimum wage, so it's 10x more.

A Back Bay lunch would effectively cost *$1*. That's crazy, right? I'm like "eh, should I really go out to sushi and spend $25?" I have the money for it, but it's only for special occasions. But as a millionaire, it'd be the effective cost of $2.5. Why NOT go out to sushi every day - it makes practically no difference.

You can extend that further to cars. I needed a car to drive when I was in CT. Cost was _kind of_ important - I had a rough price range of 30k, but wasn't willing to go to the next class of cars. But that 30k car would effectively cost 3k. So the fancier 60k car, which is a huge difference to me, would effectively be 3k vs 6k to a millionaire, which would be like "yea, sure, I'll pay double, that's not a big deal to me"
:blank:
:blank:
I think you can see where I'm going with this.
*$10mm* per year would make the lunch *10 CENTS* and the car $300.
*$100mm* per year would make the lunch *1 cent* and the car $30.
*$1b* per year would make the lunch *0.1 cent* and the car $3.
I'm sad there's not :wall_of_text: emoji
yea, I know... it works better when I'm speaking, but it kinda needs all the detail
I don't disagree, I just wanted to give you the emoji
yeah that article on bloomberg was  working with the same idea
Maybe that's where I read it
I mean it's also worth noting that there's a difference between income and networth
Billionaire/Millionaire are generally net-worth individuals, not income
That is very true and I usually talk about that, but I didn't want to make the wall of text even longer
TL;DR at that level, income gets really wonky and you don't actually pay for things and fixed costs get out of wack, so actual income doesn't really work out properly. after the 10mm level, I really just equate the two for ease of explanation
You should totally play with the link i posted though
Yea, there's also the idea that Jeff Bezos and I eat at completely different places so his lunch probably still costs him $10
<@UDBGH9BMX> now do the same math, but subtract the cost of living from the yearly salary. The difference between the 20k bracket and the 100k bracket gets WAY bigger when you only account for disposable income. Its kinda sad
Yea, CoL stuff gets weird as well. Cause there are some fixed costs that only kinda scale, some that scale negatively, and some that are exponential. But yea, it's real expensive to be poor
My favorite is the Boot story
A good pair of boots cost 200, and last 5 years
A cheap pair of boots cost 50 and last a year
Over 5 years the poor man spends 250 while the rich man only spend 200
Yupp, I like that one and this one: <https://i.redd.it/0k48k0rhsc3y.jpg>
I don't think Nike = black. I think the swoosh, which on most things is white or black.
Hey, it's Chop Suey! I got one everybody!
Another one! Friday by Rebecca Black!
When I think of the swoosh it's black, but yes to your point
Jeff Bezos probably hasn't paid for lunch in decades
WHAT IS LIFE
WHAT IS LOVE
Eternal suffering for both
Good Morning!
Summon the silent
Silence Chaos Seed
It no longer obey's you
Nah it just had to wake up :lol:
Yup it was just feeling a little slow
Like m
Squirrel means silenced?
Also would chaos seed even notify people after you've used summon the silent?
Yes
It just looks to see if you're posted not if you've been mentioned
:squirrel: is for the main thread
:salute_cap: is for the line that triggers the command
yeah I checked the response from the thread api and it doesn't return a list of users subscribed to the thread unfortuantely
I wonder where that's stored then
It could probably delete the comment if you silence it, I think that gets rid of the notification
The dead are illegal for you to be aware of.
Wtf Aysh
its Brenden's message!
So he got a really fun message and you didn't?
^ not me messing around this time
:suspicious:
I can fully confirm that I, while indeed not Drew, am not "Not Drew"
Probably Dave
What is everyone doing?
Stuff around the house until I go to work at 4
documentation. my new app is done, we just need the docs so other people can actually use it.
Fancy!
Fighting to fix a budget
Already? You just started there
Yup, I already knew the systems and process
There's also no formal training/on boarding
WTF
Also go Victoria!
Oh yea, that was me with the first Not Drew. I was just curious if it still worked
I think it'll last a while
We haven't tried to depricate it
implying that we ever actually try to deprecate something and don't just break it accidentally
Fixing bugs on a feature that was supposed to launch this morning
We don't deprecate things here, we leave them in perpetuity for the lols
We _mark_ them as depricated
but yeah that's about where it ends
Why is this quoted?
it's not :what-t:
Mobile weirdness?
Gas lighting?
I'll never know. You all might
<@UDDE5960N> are you evacuating?
<@UDC4QL95G> did you guys get the alarm on the upper floors?
No
we're good
:same:
There was 1 flash and then nothing
I left anyway. 
Really???
Interesting
Someone said Jodel said we're good
the lights flashed 3 times for me. I'll be heading out as well just in case
Two fire trucks by 222 side.  
yeah i'm otta here
For the record we had a medical emergency on the train today too
Today is my day for being concerned for others
Oooh, want to be concerned for me too?
probably not, it means you're trying to die on me
what if Im already dead CJ?
Well no need to worry then!
:ah_hmm:
:finger_up:
:finger_down:

I like the way Sean Connery is shooting all the guns while crossing his arms not on the controls
Im Hindu which means we get reincarnated!
All works out then. 
Just think, aysh never dies she just keeps coming back over and over again
It's downright horrifying
Like that last level in Mass Effect 2...
Are you talking about the human reaper?
Or something else
Signs would have been so much better if they never showed the aliens
Signs would have been better if they didn’t decide half way through to make it super Calvinist 
No, the collector guy who kept possessing enemies and you kept capping him
I LOVED SIGNS
I FELL OFF MY CHAIR FOR THIS SCENE
I didnt mind the calvinism because i dont know what calvinism IS
Are you talking about how Mel Gibson refound his faith?
Or something else?
the pre-determinism. everything happens for a reason. If things suck, its because its Gods plan
Ohhhhhhh
Yea that was also kinda lame
yeah but God's plan might be to make you suffer
Gods need  their entertainment too
In philosophy class the professor asked why all seeing and knowing gods would allow bad things to happen.  My answer they're sadists.
its like that parenting technique where you let babies cry themselves to sleep
The follow up was no one would worship sadistic gods
Aysh that's to teach something (in this case independence)
Gods letting wanton carnage are not teaching anything.  This would like letting a baby stick it's hand in a fire
depends, do they only inflict their sadism on those who don't worship them?
its your perception that makes you think it is wanton carage
if worshipping someone/something meant you avoided that thing's ire, many people would
No the gods in this scenario are just straight sadists, because bad things happen to their followers too
Stick your hand in a fire at least you learned a lesson. This sort of pre-determinisim means its impossible to learn lessons, as even basic rules of the universe are hidden from you.
We're talking about why gods let bad things happen I thought
yeah, I'd rather god do it out of neglect, then out of a deep plan.
because we're an experiment for the gods
if god plans, you don't have to
they don't want to throw off the results
you clearly didnt  force crash your race cars as a child, Doug
From the atheist point of view, it's because people look for purpose in life and want to attribute good and bad things to a higher power with a plan and make up reasons why a loving god would allow pain and suffering
if things are god's plan then you don't invest in roads. In a very serious way, this particular line of thinking is deeply ingrained in American Christianity. big reason evangelicals turned to the right starting in the 70s. Post-millennial Calvinism, suffering is good, so we don't need ot set up systems to alleviate it.
Gods make mistakes too ok? just let it go
Aysh I know what our cult is, god is a sadist, and we need to teach that bitch a lesson
antitheists
I think you're idea is more terrifying Aysh, all knowing all powerful creature that makes mistakes!
apatheists
Christianity, at least, says that god is infallible
Hinduism has stories of Gods getting into arguments quite often


even a dance off
No we're not patheists, because clearly we care and want to :middle_finger: god
antitheists
sure sounds like it
We believe in a god, we just hate him
/her
are we technically anti though?
My thought is: if being religious makes you a better person, then go for it
if I went around saying "Fuck CJ", you'd call me anti-CJ
lol
right, so anti-theist. not a-theist
I mean common moral code is flexible, if I get enough people, then whatever I want becomes common
I'm just playing devil's advocate dave
who wins the dance off?
Yea, I've debated this part of it enough times to be like "it's kinda a pedantic argument over semantics"
Valid
I still hate the idea of common or normal because it's too easy to move it
My favorite response to the whole "moral code comes from religion" comes from Penn Jillette:

&gt; The question I get asked by religious people all the time is, without God, what’s to stop me from raping all I want? And my answer is: *I do rape all I want. And the amount I want is zero. And I do murder all I want, and the amount I want is zero.* The fact that these people think that if they didn’t have this person watching over them that they would go on killing, raping rampages is the most self-damning thing I can imagine. I don't want to do that. Right now, without any god, I don't want to jump across this table and strangle you. I have no desire to strangle you. I have no desire to flip you over and rape you.
mmm, indeed.
yea doesn't that reinforce my point?
Crusades. It's okay to kill people because the pope says they aren't people. Just as movable as a "normal" or "common" morality, or maybe even more so.
No, what I'm saying is that you can't use religion as a good way to "solidify" morality
Oh for SURE!
It's probably even more capricious than "common" moral code
100%
Shiva  wins against Parvati (his wife)
Interesting. The Bible is much less fun. 
I always like the idea of unalienable rights
Would be nice
Make it a little more expansive and call it a day
Man I wish I was more charismatic, then I could make a religion about fucking over god
Could make up my own pantheon of evil gods
that do weird shit
It's called Greek Mythology
But their still like good natured
<https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bane>
^plenty of evil gods out there.
Yea, but I want them to be only gods
I did a DnD setting like this. The gods realize humans are able to hurt them, so they freak out and turn on you.  So you have to kill them before they destroy the word. 
Talk about a level 20 quest with macguffin galore
Gods were weakened quite a bit by the time you run into them. Players did start like leave 10. 
Each was going to have a combat gimmick, but we didn’t make it all the way through before scheduling stopped things. 
Like the god of law would only attack by giving you new rules to follow and you’d take damage if you decided to go against one. 
Well, Iowa was certainly unexpected this year. 
Bots can't die
I like the way this is phrased, as if to suggest you get reincarnated because you're Hindu, but everyone else just goes wherever their religion says they go after death. How do you want the afterlife to be? You choose!
Mel Gibson was Catholic wasn't he?
I've actually come to the conclusion that it is a matter of by allowing choice, you have to allow the ability for the wrong choices to be made. So bad things happen often because other humans make bad choices, and for there to be actual love of the god, the person has to deliberately choose them.
Doesn't explain why wiping out a city with a tsunami is in the world...
It's like a really horrible parenting technique though
Please don't raise your child that easy though. The psychological harm of letting a kid cry itself to sleep is pretty well documented, and not the kind of shit you easily work out with therapy!
Ugh, redacted not letting me edit
Basically, crying a baby to sleep is terrible, and well documented the effects
Odd. Seen many more women win dance offs than men
because they didn't resolve it?
Yea but crazy version
yea but this is basically like saying if I set my children abandoned on an Island and some lord of the flies shit happens, not my fault
yup
Mel is Catholic (also a crazy person) but the movie really isn't.
I'm fascinated by caucuses, because how do they get any turnout from people if they have to all show up around the same time? Do they get work off for it? Or is it all just old people who have the time
crazy people
Dunno guess I'll have to go read up on it
But I am totally training a kick ass independent girl
Good Morning!
Summon the silent
Totally should! Just you know, doesn't have to be the baby crying itself to sleep method
I'm more and more coming to the conclusion that America government is trying to murder itself
Lord of the Flies is no interaction whatsoever. I don't think that is the case, and there's some stuff that happens to try and reignite faith. More like Lord of the Flies where some people get notes from the outside world and there's some supply drops every so often.
all of the above.
Its even weirder for Nevada, since so many people there are in the service industry
That's called suicide
I'm pretty sure that random supply drops makes lord of the flies WAY worse, than just internal squabbling
Huh
this is just a party, not the government.
When there are only 2 parties and both of them have given up any semblance of caring what do you expect
why is redacted not actually deleting cjs messages?
There are two bots fighting. 
One just converts CJ to a bot, the other censors. They both trigger, neither knows about the other. 
It’s on my to-do list to fix. 
We were so busy afraid they would revolt, we never considered that they would try to kill each other
But it will not be an easy fix. 
No, it's a massive refactoring of how we post messages
You almost need 2 paths, a react path like emoji bomb and a replace path like redact bot
That I’ve already done. 
It’s just getting the replaces to work together which is tough. Which should go first? What if the text you’re trying to replace was already changed?
Randomized order every time
ONLY CHAOS SHOULD REIGN!!!!
Bonus points for assigning an emoji to each bot and having reposts have all the associated emojis
That would be nice and not hard. 
Doug you're like Lawful in a land of Chaotic.  We don't need no stinking rules
Let the Dice gods decide!
Chaos is not the absence of rules. The absence of rules is void. Chaos is the application of rules. The universe is tightly governed and highly chaotic.
Chaos is the rules being probabilities, not strict rules.  You know that sounds kinda funny if our Laws had probabilities instead of definite punshiments
You have a 1% chance to be put to death and a 1% chance to be set free, 40% for life in prison and 50% for 5 years, 8% to do community service for 1000 hours every year
1000 hours of community service a year is a full part time job!
20 hours per week
Caucuses are kinda ridiculous
ah the God also has a half man/ half woman form :slightly_smiling_face: so maybe it counts?
I mean the whole process is kinda ridiculous
Well, the idea behind is is good... but caucuses as an election form are silly
i dont know what a caucus is and I am aware I can google it
Everyone who votes bernie stand next to me
sounds inappropriate
People literally vote with their bodies
sounds inappropriate
Everyone who votes warren go stand in the corner
I mean, choices Brenden choices
Lol anybody who comes back from china is required to work from home for 14 days
All business travel to china is banned
what abut 'through' china- why is that not banned?
You don't travel through china to get to the US all that much
my PM just came back from a work trip . through Hong Kong :shrug:
Does Hong Kong count as china!?!?!?
yes
the real question is Taiwan
Ohhhh even BETTER!
Well nonwork politics is losing it's collective shit over Iowa
yeah, how are the results still not out yet?
Clearly the DNC might have better aims than the RNC, but they're just as evil
I'm thinking Lawful evil vs. chaotic evil
It's not the DNC tho, right?
It's an Iowa affair, nothing to do with the DNC?
Come on Dave, you're gonna say that the DNC has nothing to do with how the states run their primary? Or that fact that this was in 2 states not 1?
the DNC might be the lesser of 2 evils, but that still makes it evil
I don't like calling them "the lesser of 2 evils" because it implies that they're comparable to the RNC. It's the same thing that the media did with clinton vs trump.

&gt; Trump may have mocked a disabled reporter, but one time Clinton said something mean. They're not on the same level, but she's still the lesser of 2 evils
They're not comparable and it leads to the same "Both Sides are the Same" line of thinking to compare them in that way
That being said, the DNC is out for itself, not for the good of the country per se. I don't think it's evil, but it's also not going to push progressive candidates
But it pretends and that makes it evil
I don't see how the DNC has pretty much anything to do with the Iowa caucus
It pretends what?
It pretends to be for the good of country, and I don't get how you can sit there and be like the Iowa DNC caucus has nothing to do with the DNC
You can totally put in on the local leadership, but that's still DNC
I can't see any link online between them. The only reason the DNC is trending right now is that they changed the rules of the debate for Bloomberg. Which is really crappy, I totally agree
They pretend to be for the good of themselves and the continuation of the Democratic party as they see it, which is the establishment candidates.
Pshhhhhh, that's what they do. Not what they pretend
They pretend to care about disenfranchised but only when it lines up with keeping the party in power
They pretend to care about the primaries, but only as long as it lines up with the establishment candidate
It's the old boys club at least their progressive enough to include powerful women too
I'm more so saying even if there isn't a "smoking gun" they all know each other
The DNC is an organization, of course it can choose to influence how the states pick representatives
People in state level politics know each other? Yea, probably. But we can't blame the DNC for this without some pretty substantial proof
I don't like unsubstantiated disinformation
It’s just bad code. That’s not evil. 
A major fuck up in the first state of the primaries where the establishment candidate is not going to do well
For the first time in many election cycles, in an organization that has CLEARLY cheated in the past
And we're just gonna say, "No reason to look deeper here, clearly just a little data issue"
I was talking with someone about this yesterday. I dont' see any "clearly" after doing some looking into it. The most I could see is:
1. Some staffers (late into the cycle) liked Clinton and didn't like Bernie
2. The chairman gave Clinton debate question(s?) for a single debate on her own volition to curry favor with Clinton
The whole thing appears a lot of "Clinton knew how to politic and campaign better than Bernie" and who to talk to
You can totally go with the fact that US tends to alternate parties hard, and coming off a Dem Pres means we didn't bring out the A team, only having Hillary vs. Bernie compared to both this year's Dem primaries and Rep primaries. And as such all of the super delegates picked Hillary
Which lets be honest, only exists to make sure the DNC gets to pick the DNC candidate unless near universal selection of the masses
I didn't follow the primary cycle too much last year (nor this year), but didn't I remember reading that Hillary had enough to win even without the super delegates? And I'm still not 100% on what a super delegate is
Super Delegates are preselect people who have as much voting power as a regular delegate
Which basically means, the DNC says you people are just as powerful as 1,000s of our constituents
basically think class A/B shares in a company
And sure, she won without them because the optics always looked like Bernie was going to fail when it's first to 400, and it's 100 to 0
before the first vote is cast
/roll d20+2
WTF!?!?!?
WTF!?!?!!?
Super Delegates literally exist so the masses can't pick the DNC candidate
If superdelegates still exist, why does Bernie seem to be a front runner and have a significant chance? Assuming what you just said is true?
Front runner is a little bit of a stretch.....
I would say, hasn't managed to shot himself in the foot unlike the other major contenders sure
But if it was locked up from the start, wouldn't he have no chance of winning at all?
All I'm saying is that the DNC isn't some evil beast and Hillary won because she was better at campaigning and better at politics and it wasn't some big rigged conspiracy
I think you're underestimating how small nudges can have a massive impact on something as massive as this
Thinking back to the gore/bush election and the fact that it came down to 2 districts
I mean living in Mass and RI has always meant little because we're not a swing state
But dark horse depend on honest transparency, and the primaries can be nudged in the right direction with just a little bit of effort
So... politics?
I mean, that's how politics works. You campaign, get people on your side, nudge them
It's not the DNC cheating or rigging
No dave, when I say nudge, I say closing venues so people can't vote
I'm saying make it seem like someone is losing
I'm saying deleting data
I would love to see any evidence of voter suppression. Cause then I'd 100% agree with you - voter suppression is horrible
By the DNC*
The republicans are doing it in spades
<https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-elections/new-york-city-purged-voters-2016-it-wasnt-mistake.html>
<https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/opinions/democrats-need-reform-new-york-primary-weaver/index.html>
So, the first article, I'm reading and will have to cross reference, but I'm questioning it's bias based on the line:
&gt; The lack of media attention was in stark contrast to the recent barrage of headlines about a right-wing push to purge eligible voters from the rolls. Much of the media ignored New York’s proven case of election fraud, perhaps because it had been facilitated by Democrats, and not by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican with a national profile for championing stricter voter ID legislation.
Nevermind, they are reported as Least Biased, ignore that
Just saying Dave, the last cycle left a bad taste in my mouth
So no, the DNC doesn't get a "everybody make mistakes" they get the most cynical critical take
But the Iowa thing has nothing to do with the DNC
Also Super delegates!
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdelegate>
Also, don't see what the DNC has to do with the voter purge in NYC
Dave... Who in your mind runs these events?
The State Board of Elections
for NYC at least
It's a pretty big thing for the country that states control their own election procedures. Which is a bit of a mess and is kind a terrible idea, but MuH states rights
For the primaries of each party?
Because I'm under the impression that State Board of Elections doesn't get to play when it comes to who the Republicans and Democrats put up for election
I could very well be wrong, I haven't done research here
Ahhhhh SHIT!!!! As a break from dave and I arguing about the merits to the DNC the BOS_Announcements channel is heating up
They're shutting down the kitchen the dedicated to eating tomorrow and people are pissed!
*CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to the People’s Republic of China (this does not include the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, or the island of Taiwan).*
Update: The rabble was shut down by not acknowledging them
I... it's really weird that they send this email about lunch spaces and then schedule things anyway, but they're REALLY stretching for why it's bad they're scheduling the meetings
Especially since that lunch space didn't exist a year ago when there were a bunch more ppl in this building
I would say bad on Community Experience to offer up the largest free space, that was just a bad idea.  But I'm gonna side with them Dave, CVS never blocked the Cafe's during lunch
Wayfair can't figure out how to host events without shutting down the only free space to eat?
It's bullshit
You got hit. Badly
I'm missing something here. They shut down a kitchen and people are pissed because...?
Ah, yeah that was a super shitty practice that they started right before I left Wayfair. Like give people a place to eat. Use your giant conference rooms for events. It's pretty cut and dry.
Because they sent out an email this year about how "We've listened and we're dedicating this to only eating!"
Mannnn CJ, I was trying to be on the same side of a debate as you for this. I thought you were mocking them so I tried to join in that
HAHAHAHHA
No worries Dave
I was totally mocking community Experience, she's not my fav person in the world, but I think she's totally on point here
Threads. 
Threads?
By "community Experience", you mean Rachel?
I'm on Rachel's side, because I think Jessica is wrong
Yea, you said that "she's not my fav person in the world", so i figured you were talking about Rachel with that
Can I get a short summary of sides. What is Rachel's and community experiences side, and who is Jessica and who does she represent?
I've had too many arguments today, I'm out of arguing for today :sadpotato:
Clearly, that was a lie
Ah, I didn't get to participate?
Well you usually align with me on political issues, so I did enough for both of us :smile:
Rachel is basically bitching about how they're taking away our kitchens.
Jessica is the person who communicated the no kitchen 
Community experience dedicated this kitchen to only lunches not even a month ago
Rachel is the girl who dakota and I use as the spicy level for non work politics
Generally dave will be on her side, but he is articulate awesome where she comes across as a bully and asshole
Usually yes.  I also agree with the slipped slope of how calling the DNC evil creates the false "both sides are the same" bs. 
I did find myself agreeing with <@UDDE5960N> a lot though that the DNC has done some shady shit and super delegates are fucked up
This shady shit being beyond the scope of "politicking"
Sorry dave, know that I enjoy our arguments! Even if we don't generally agree
No, I do agree that the DNC isn't perfect and has done some shady stuff. They definitely favor the establishment candidate who knows how to campaign
Iowa is out
Ehhhhh I would go with establishment candidates  ~who knows how to campaign ~
The RNC has gone radical evil, I'd rather the DNC went more radical progressive. AOC, the Squad, hell, I'll take Bernie.
ooooh
Yeah I don't like Rachel from what I've seen. I just didn't realize Community Experience was the one coming out saying "Hey, kitchens for eating, not meeting"
Wow, so it's like, a mini-electoral college inside a mini-electoral college? That sounds awful
Got it crossed that Jessica and scheduling meetings was a community experience thing
It’s pretty bad. 
Am I missing an emoji for deja vu <@UDC4QL95G>?
Sorry my bad! Yea basically they went back on their word like 2 weeks later
Picking the candidate who will face the actual electoral college. Sorry <@UDC4QL95G>, yeah, your vote means nothing
the message with the emoji was deleted due to REDACTED
HA
I WILL NEVER VOTE
Okay, I'm not arguing this, but I like Buttigieg. I was impressed by him at the debates, looked at his wikipedia, and liked his positions
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM DAKOTA YOU MATTER ON A LOCAL LEVEL!
Well, yes, that
Don't really know a lot about him. He and yang feel like the dark horses this race
I'd rather that too, but that's not how it is, so :shrug:
Well he came in a close 2nd, so not really sure about Dark Horse haha
Oh, it's only 62% reporting rn
Dark horse as in not really a contender when this all started
ah, okay
No worries! I'm ok with Bernie losing as long as we get someone who gives a damn
Ewwwww
Not to start another argument, but I've actually never been impressed by Bernie
And this is where I want to watch it all burn
:kill_it_with_fire:
:kirby-sleep:
I think that's fine. It's more the mandate of the public that we want reform. Impressed or not he has continually been on the right side of history
Election Day really should be a holiday. 
Wayfair gives PTO to vote?
:shamebell:
2 hours. 
That is awesome if they do, and if it gets people to register
They've proposed and gotten buy in from senior leadership that we _*should*_ have PTO to vote
We don't yet
I thought we got two hours? I seem to remember something like that. 
Oh, maybe it’s just that the business needs to allow up to 2 hours by state law, but it’s not paid. And with a salary I conflated the two. 
I did not know Mass had a law about time off for voting. I wonder if we qualify as Mercantile?
And 2 hours after the polls open is oddly specific
That is mostly true. I do like the progressive reform message
Will he get shit done, doubtful. Will everyone else sit up and pay attention, oh hell yes
There was an email sent out from the committee formed to handle the selling the beds to the ICE issue. I'm waiting for activism to go on a rampage
It's really placated by the suggestions
I'm kinda sad
I think they threw the PTO for voting in there as a distraction
I mean it's good that apparently the committee did a good job, but I'm sad there's no :mj_popcorn:
There is nothing in there that says we won't sell to the ICE
If you read the comments it explicitly says this would allow that order to go through
And that you can "opt out" of helping it
Yeah but that "opt out" is just hand-wavey feel good stuff. If you are an engineer working on the order processing system, you cannot "opt out" of letting the order through the flow
More so you don't have to personally touch orders, but yea if you set up the system
It's totally hand wavy, but it's hand wavy enough that no one can get upset
HA, I seriously doubt that any warehouse worker or driver that tries to opt out of touching that order will last long at wayfair
Middle management doesn't have time for that bullshit
I think that's where a lot of this stuff falls apart
CEO can say whatever he wants, and lower management has to make it happen, and it's just easier to make problem children disappear
&gt; Assemble a team with representatives from Talent, Field and Legal to determine whether and how we should allow individual employees to “opt out” of processing or fulfilling an order that violates their personal beliefs.
oof, that's really bad.
ALSO they have not committed to letting employees opt out
good
just `determine whether and how`
opting out would be a distaster
a total disaster
for sure
Nahhhhh you guys are thinking corporate or evil enough
Sorry, I only write code to sell to white customers
:several_people_are_typing:
For me, it's not that I was directly responsible for these things... it was that wf was profiting off the beds
Or, really, being a part of selling them
Ah, well none of those recommendations are gonna stop that
You just need to give notice 2 months in advance of the specific order that you feel uncomfortable with
don't you mean 2 weeks :ba-dum-tss:
Yea dave, this totally didn't address the outrage you had
I know
I like that one
But I was going more with impossible to fulfill requirements
oh for sure, I just couldn't resist
WE SURE DO LET YOU OPT OUT!!! AFTER YOU DEFEAT GANNON AND SUARON!
The PTO thing is so out of place that it has to be a distraction. It's the only thing concrete in there
Or it's the only thing that they committed to that doesn't have the possibility of making us all unemployed without careful enacting
I think that the people in that group care. But there's not much they can do, so this is the best they can do
Interesting there WERE downvotes for even the PTO thing from the group
Where do you see that?
Gotta go into the comments section
You know what I found SUPER interesting
there's a lot of 14/16 votes
I'd love to see how actual people voted
Comments of the memo?
Also there were no dissenting votes, everything was approved!
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AwPHdAP9bBI_rTjfk740zv_clv8zHsFC5xZUelTuyvM/edit#heading=h.3utdckqs9g2w>
The non Wayfairians can't get in
Okay, yea, I'm reading that now
Wait, who THE DUCK votes against "Don't supply orders to hate groups"?
I'm gonna go with someone who has political leaning like Dakota
That person is voting that we should supply literal nazis. That's liberterianism to the extreme
I think the part you're overstating is the idea that we have to spin up a team to determine who is a nazi, and who isn't a nazi.  And all the crazy gray lines inbetween
Officially designated hate group is a pretty good start
And they justify it like:
&gt; doesn’t this take us down a slippery slope that may make some of us feel good in response to our current political context but come back to haunt us

Slippery slope arguments are a fallacy for a reason
Ehhhhhhh
Slippery slope can be used to justify literally anything so it's pointless as a debate point
just put chains on your tires
IMO I have no problem with wayfair selling to hate groups
I mean yes dave I get that it's not a great debate point
notably they do say violent hate groups.
that does remove some of the potential ambiguity.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance> is an interesting thought here
But, the way to hell is paved with good intentions.  Once you start participating you cant ever stop.
Dakota is super libertarian, which, although a viewpoint that doesn't work for the world, makes this statement understandable
Yes, I agree. But you must be careful and considerate not to become the intolerant
So why ever try to do good things?
No, it's not easy
But that's why there are councils and meetings and groups made to come up with the hard decisions
I get that Dave, but there's also the argument to be made that Wayfair making these decisions isn't it's core functionality.  And if you outsource it who do you outsource it too?
US gov isn't going to declare itself ethical bankrupt, so who do you trust?
But it is part of the core corporate culture
This one I don't get, could you elaborate?
I'm fat.............
officially designated by who?
I'm tired and just wanting to complain
You're not fat yet Mei that will come
you suck, go away
Also feel better
I LOVE YOU!
you forgot my oil massages!!!!
We have corporate culture, culture fit, and ethics as a core part of who wf is, right? We all went through the indoctrination at the start of our employment
:daveapprovesofthismessage: is apparently an emoji
lol
I was trying to look at it
You didn't ask?
I was typing :massage: but spelling it wrong
it's asked unspokenly everyday
Which is all organized around selling furniture not determine who is a bad person.
I mean... I feel this is pedantic as this point. There are officially designated hate groups by different government agencies
Hell, part of our shtick is we want non-political employees (different context I know but is relevant as these people want to solve problems not have debates)
Whatever, I'm not up for an argument about if we should sell to nazis or not
I'd have hoped there would be an obvious answer to that question, but I'm not going to argue it
I think the nuance I'm going for is defining true Nazis is hard.  Or to quote a supreme court judge "I don't know how to describe pornography but I know when I see it"
Which is all organized around selling furniture not determine who is a bad person.
Can I have a massage every day too then CJ?
Dave, you need to get your own significant other for that :slightly_smiling_face:
I need to get my own significant other for more than that
But CJ does look like he'd give good massages
I'm more a sadist who enjoys causing pain
And no dave, currency I want for massages you don't have
I was trying to come up with a funny response for that, but couldn't think of anything
&gt; *Establish a senior leader accountable for business ethics concerns*.  Currently there is not a clear single owner for ethics concerns.  We recommend designating a single-threaded owner -- perhaps the Head of Corporate Social Responsibility? -- who will be accountable for creating effective mechanisms to surface, triage and address concerns with our business practices, and create appropriate transparency into our decision-making process.  *[88%, 14/16, agree]*
I nominate Rachel just to see what happens
It would either be awful and wf would implode in a year, or we'd be seen as a bastion of social progress and explode in popularity and profits
Haha, the only votes that were unanimous were the ones that were "do nothing but sound good"
Like, who voted no on
&gt; Allow employees to file a “business ethics” PT ticket into a backlog that will be owned by the single-threaded owner described above.  This will make it easier for us to document and track concerns, and ensure follow-through.  *[94%, 15/16, agree]*
HA HA! OUTWITTED!
I don't think she qualifies as senior, no clue about leader
That's not that hard of a goal
That's why we make her one
Silly silly people dave
Rebels
Doubtful
/roll d20+1
Boooooo
If your expectations are low, you will always be happy
Or the secret to a happy life is low expectations
But why would you waste however many hours it is to stand in the center of a room... it's not like you're making a statement...
maybe it was a republican that wanted to watch the silly tradition
:nova1::nova2::nova3::nova4::nova5:
Wow.... whoever made the nova's is unique
looks like a mistake to me
Probably
But it is missing the notation 1-1 and has those giant whitespaces
I think that's my favorite example of how non-work politics wants to just argue with itself
I this case it is less my libertarian stance and more about what we sell. If wayfair sold guns, then I'd be 100% against selling guns to hate groups
Yeah, but that's still a mini electoral college, inside the primaries which are also a mini electoral college, before the actual electoral college
At the same time of course
Not sure I follow. The people are right that "So you're saying it was a shitty app because bootcamp engineers, while acknowleding that a lot of the successful engineers at Wayfair are also bootcamp grads?"
Just seems pretty succinct to me
yea, I think we're just agreeing harder
No I'm saying the purpose the the tweet is to say maybe you shouldn't have super junior people and a senior person with no experience in the field build something from scratch, and everyone jumped on the "BOOT CAMPS ARE GOOD" bandwagon
It's more building shit with no experience is generally ALWAYS going to end bad.
<@UDC4QL95G> what was the initiative app?
i get what CJ is saying- if the tweet said 'recent university graduates' it would have held the same meaning (to the person who shared it). But I do think the 'code academy' was intended to be derogatory so i understand why they  pounced.
Signboard
this is why I'm with CJ :slightly_smiling_face:
I'm tiredddddddddddd
me two
I tried to come up with a positive way to spin that but failed
There is none
Agreed, but they don't even ask or debate it.  They're just "YOU'RE TERRIBLE HUMAN BEING!"
Mei you're always tired
shut up CJ
<@UK7V13DS7>, the proper command is "Silence Chaos Seed"
It doesn't respond to anything else
/roll d20-1
Appraisal failed, everyone dies
That sounds... fun!
But which floor!
Well sure, but from what little bits of Lee's messages I have seen posted here before, he's a terrible human being.
I mean probably. I'm still of the opinion this is an easy example of how they'll freak out about anything. The reasonable read is, junior people fuck shit up. Their read is boot camp people are terrible. And let's be clear the tweet even calls out the fact the senior person isn't a good fit.
Good morning!
Summon the silent
AWKWARD!
Deleted good morning?
Also mine doesn't sound ominous at all. "Hey, get scared fucker, you're going to heaven!"
The repost CJ as a bot triggered after I threaded it
So there's good morning later in the channel
Yeah congratulations Drew!
I mean.... generally if you hear the choirs of heaven while living... it's not a good sign. And if they never stop.... Well drew at least you'll be on the front lines of Rapture
I'll take it, best way to go
Slack is glitching
Interesting
Someone explain the scramble bot to me again. Does it have higher odds to scramble when lower word count?
.15/(count of words)
So by that math, the longer the message, the less likely to scramble
yes
Now it's hilariously rare for something over 15 words to get scrambled but something with 4 words to get scrambled
I would like to tweak it some more so you're get higher rates at lower word counts
But that takes more effort for an algo then I'm willing to put in right now
Fair, we can read the shorter scrambles pretty well
I still copy paste my longer messages just in case. It's very pavlovian
I mean there is a non zero chance
Does anyone have any fun valentines day plans?
Wow, way to make people feel bad about not having plans
You say this like I have fun valentines day plans
Play Tragedy Looper :smile:
See shitfaced Shakespeare
You know Dave, I totally want to do another round of Overcooked
THAT WAS EPIC
I'm thinking of getting this from humble bundle as well (part of the monthly) <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/>
I played it at PAX and it was surprisingly fun
Mainly cause in the harder part, everything ended up on fire
&gt; Unrailed! is like a slow-grind, roguelike version of Overcooked, and is _very_ intense, despite how calm it may appear when watching gameplay
Slow grind seems less fun then frantic mayhem
alright that looks super fun
you have a slow moving train, but you don't have a track. You gotta go get resources to build track and bridges across obsticals before the train hits the end of the track
isn't it just minecraft?
Question for the group, trying to get my bf into games, what are some good introductory games I can get. I was thinking of starting him with carcasonne...
Centry Spice Road
Dominion
I would go with a co-op, so pandemic, forbidden island
Carcasonne is a good one as long as you are nice about dominating the fields
carcasonne would have been my answer
just don't play with fields first time
I second Pandemic, worked really well for my parents
Yea, it was pretty great. I'd have to see how it works over time though, cause it was fun for a few minutes, but not sure if there are enough mechanics for hours
Are some of those 2 player?
Nice, I appreciate the suggestions! I may get pandemic then since he liked the Netflix documentary series on actual pandemics
All of them
I would suggest pandemic legacy if you are willing to pay a bit more for it
don't start with a legacy game
you can play normal pandemic, and if he likes it, you can do the full campaign, which is way more fun
I'd second Doug - I wouldn't start with a legacy game
if he doesn't like it, you can resell the game easily since you won't have made any modifications to the card/board
Also, Pandemic Iberia is a better Pandemic unless you like the original theme better
where is this?
I am suggesting pandemic legacy specifcally because it can be played as the base game
I also wouldn't start with anything coop. Pandenic isn't actually a game, its a puzzle. hits a different spot in the brain
humble bundle?
What is?
I second Pandemic, worked really well for my parents
Hrm, I guess I always considered pandemic a game, but different opinions and all that
I've never actually played Carcassonne
Also, word/social games like Codenames or Decrypto (in that order) are great
Kingdomino is super easy to get
It starts slow but ends a lot faster
Rockwell theater in Davis Square
I would also suggest 7 Wonders Duel, and Star Realms. Both have worked well with Sam. Pandemic and Forbidden Desert were also good ones
Never got through it. Would like to go back and do that
It's great fun, they do a limited cast, shortened version of a play where one cast member is completely drunk
Said this in a comment, but I found coop games worked well for getting Sam into games beyond Catan
It's great fun, they do a limited cast, shortened version of a play where one cast member is completely drunk
and from there 7 Wonders Duel and Star Realms are low touch 2 player games. Star Realms because you play open handed on your turn, so you can easily walk him through a turn
Said this in a comment, but I found coop games worked well for getting Sam into games beyond Catan
After playing through the whole thing, I kinda got pandemic'd out. It was fun enough, but the Legacy aspect of it was the only reason i kept playing
I agree with doug in that it is more of a series of puzzles and less of a game
Ticket to Ride is a classic for getting people into board games
Europe or US map?
BGG had US rated way higher than Europe, and having only played Europe, that seems strange to me
Seemed like Europe was more dynamic from Doug and Brenden's descriptions
Puzzles together though!
I can see it being a drag. But this was a lower tolerance for complexity game group, so it was a good way to get them into a campaign or legacy aspect
I'll have to look it up. How frequent or recurring?
I'd also upvote Star Realms. A bunch of ppl on my team loved that game even though they didnt' play board games
What is Humble Bundle, or which Humble Bundle is it in?
It's also cheap, and portable
Play it at a bar
Where you know the bartender
and can get free drinks
and samples...lots of samples
and then hang out with Brenden, who's also drunk playing games with marissa
party!
Please explain the concept of Humble Bundles
<@UDD45P5A9> I have lots of 2 player game recommendations, but I need more info about your bf
would he appreciate strategy?
any games he's enjoyed in the past?
He's not a big game player because his family plays Life, Monopoly, Dutch Blitz, etc. I want to convince him there are better games
He plays a fair bit of video games that are first person shooter or strategy, so I'm thinking he'd like some minor strategy games
Also games that don't take forever to learn
Reason i go with co-op is because it's we, so you don't have to question if someone is giving you good info where as in a competitive people do have an incentive to make you bad
He plays a fair bit of video games that are first person shooter or strategy, so I'm thinking he'd like some minor strategy games
I mean I'd make sure he was set with game rules/play before I destroyed him
I'm not a complete monster
*2 Player Games:*
&gt; Schotten Totten
&gt; The Fox in the Forest
&gt; Cribbage
&gt; Hive
Humble Bundle is a company that started the popularity of video game bundles. They started way back with Humble Indie Bundle 1 like... 10 years ago. They started by offering a bundle of games, and you choose what you paid for it. That's evolved now to them offering a bundle with different tiers, so if you pay $1+ you get these 3 games, beat the average you get these 4 additional games, and $15+ you get these 2 additional games.

They also have Humble Choice/Monthly, which is what this particular game is in, but that's just a weird version of a regular bundle
*Games that can be played with 2+ players:*
&gt; Century: Spice Road
&gt; Century: Eastern Wonders (only if you liked Spice Road)
&gt; Dominion
&gt; Hanabi
&gt; Race for the Galaxy (experienced 2 player variant) <#CM55FMEA0|race-for-the-galaxy> (there's a phone app with online play)
&gt; Terraforming Mars (there's a phone app with online play)
<https://www.humblebundle.com/games/train-simulator?hmb_source=navbar&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=tile_index_1> is an example of a bundle. This one is weird because it's all one game and its DLC, but it shows the general concept
I'm a bit questionable on a bunch of those as "first time" games to get into games
as far as easy to learn, try these first:
spice road
the fox in the forest
Schotten Totten
I only suggest race and TM for the phone apps
where there's a tutorial and let's him get into it at his own pace
but those should be after the first game or two
Yeah, Race went horribly trying to teach Sam
I'm literally on the "welp, got to convince the future kids to play with me that one someday. Meanwhile, grind out those digital reps"
What do the games play through? Steam? or just you get the dedicated app?
I'm literally on the "welp, got to convince the future kids to play with me that one someday. Meanwhile, grind out those digital reps"
Brenden, can I borrow Schotten Totten to teach Sam sometime? We need more 2 player low complexity games
Amazing
I love that channel topic
but monster you are. Throw a party!
They're almost always Steam keys
Going back to earlier topics, I support an Overcooked or Unrailed game day
or other games like Mario party. Doug was open to hosting a game day at his place sometime
nonwork-politics dramaaaaaaaaaaaa
I'm assuming regarding Trump Aquittal
ugh i was totoally wrong- i saw a pinned message from a while ago and thought it was now
lan party would also work
yea i noticed that too at one point
maybe it wasnt pinned and someone just did?
maybe
or maybeeeeeeeee..................
Like local lan party, or lan party where we all play from our own homes?
excluding VPN bullshit
by definition a lan party is us on the same lan which we'd need to do from one place
I'd love to host if y'all could make the treck out to my place. I even have a living room computer :slightly_smiling_face:
I'd join
I'm so sad that games don't support LAN as much anymore
are you guys getting these pings from the new bot?
Someone had it enabled
I've gotten those in the past. its been a while since I've seen it
I don't get anything specific like that
I've been getting them every m/w/f
It's super annoying
stop going to meetings
But I like meetings
Do nothing use it as an excuse
ever play speedrunners?
no
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDGzN0fRQI0>
you can play with a bunch of people at the same computer
solid game
I've considered getting that a few times, but it never really jumped out to me... it seemed to me like a game that would be more fun to watch on youtube than play. But I never did play
Seems nifty
not sure my cup o tea though
alright, how about we play some good old C&amp;C
preferably generals
Oh fuck yea
I mean original C&amp;C is, or RA
C&amp;C?
Command and Conquer
alright, how about we play some good old C&amp;C
Is that RTS?
That's not local tho?
I'd vote for Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge, Generals: Zero Hour, or Tiberian Wars
yes, an RTS
:gross_blob:
it's a franchise of strategy games put out orginally by Westwood, but then bought by EA
What!?!?!? Dakota you don't like RTS????
back when EA wasn't a piece of shit
Not a fan of RTS. Big fan of Custom Games in RTS though
I like WATCHING RTSs, but not playing them
SC2? Bad. SC2 Custom Games: Hell yeah
RTS's are just too much like work and can't have fun playing them
too much work?
Love me some Dota tho
Too much repetition as well. It's a major reason I got bored of LOL
I NEED TO MURDER ALL THE THINGS
Too many things to focus on at a time
ahh, that makes sense
I don't like having to micro and macro and keep jumping around the map
there is a lot to focus on
:hmm:
I always like doing as teams
star wars battlefront 2, the old one?
Like 2 on 2 or 3v3
That's why I like dota - it's like an RTS, but I can focus on one thing and do that well
now that was a fun game
There are PLENTY of good online games haha
Seems nifty
Battlefront 2 was amazing. I loved the perminant progression system in multiplayer games with the trophies
I grinded that game out for so long...
CoD was the only game I got into with that
I have a pirated, pre-modded copy of that game that supports LAN
I have an Xbox that has like every N64, GBA, and Arcade game, and a bunch of xbox games, including modded copies of the game.
as an aside: a game that was sunset in 2017 that I really enjoyed just appeared in my steam library again
I'm downloading it to see if they resurrected the servers
what game?
was it Lord of the Rings Conquest
Firefall
Don't even know that one
Darn
I'd be surprised if you'd heard of it
That game excited me like crazy
which one?
When I first saw the teaser trailer like, 12 years ago or something
I had a couple max level frames
(Firefall)
It was before F2P games really took off and they were like "This is an MMO that's just as good as a AAA game, that you can fly around, AND is Free!"
I just want another game with the destruction physics of Red Faction: Gorilla
And it looked so cool to me. Then it finally released years later and it was met with a tepid response
it was a bit repetitive
they could have done so much more
Yea. That first teaser tho... back when I still got excited by teasers
I was hoping for a game where the community needed to fight to expand their territory into the meld
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhiJtotZNWk>
and it was a constant battle
Yea, and that's the kind of stuff they said would happen
Seems ambitious
it was
was still a decent game
and the ai had stupidly good accuracy
to account for people's dodging skills
but it never really became what I envisioned
While dynamic games seem neat, I feel like they always fall apart when it comes to reality because games are a past time not a job
and then there's eve
Although with Streamers.... maybe
As popular as eve in the mind of gamers you don't actually meet all those many who do play it.
Like it's been around forever with a small group of people, but I don't think it ever really caught fire
and it was a constant battle
Like it's been around forever with a small group of people, but I don't think it ever really caught fire
the people that do play it don't go outside
that's why you don't see them
it is a way of life, not a game
Game Nostalgia thread
I really wish there were more games out there like Majesty.  Build your own fantasy Sim game.  No direct control only influence
false alarm, game didn't work
Awwwww
Because it's MMO so it needs the servers?
yep, I'm surprised steam let me download all 17 GB of it
given that it's obsolete
<@UDC4QL95G> you should try warframe if you like grindy FPS
Banjo Kazooie
Game I never really played but always wanted to
Tomba
I don't even know what that is!!!!
came across this: <https://np.ironhelmet.com/#landing>
Interesting, also neat that your's are PS
I don't even know what that is!!!!
ohhhhh bot.....
I played majesty back in the day
I kinda wish there was MMO version where the players were both the heros and the kings
I think it would be hilarious
have you all played borderlands 2 yet?
that's definitely a co-op game we could play
have you all played borderlands 2 yet?
I feel like CJ would enjoy shooting stuff in a game like that
the humor seems right up his alley
I haven't played the newer ones though
YEah I played 1 and 2
there are newer ones?
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel
Borderlands: 3
Is that angry Aysh? Exasperated?
Tired :cry:
So angry
With life
What is life!
What is life Dakota!
you look like you are ready to toss your ocmputer monitor across the room
Which would be fun
I like the headband though!
Drew your inner caddie is showing.
Holy shit you remembered more than I expected from the Park night
Or...maybe that was the walk back to your place where we talked about donating to the homeless
Nah this was WAY back. From when you were still working at wayfair
like over a year
Oh I'm mixing conversations with when Brenden was at the bar
I want to play borderlands 3 with you all
if you're interested
But yeah, inner caddie: notice small details. Keeps conversation going
Either way, you appear to have understood why the comment was contextually relevant, so when the converation actually happened doesn't really matter
:nice:
Exactly what I was getting at
borderlands games really shine when playing coop. I'd be up for that.
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UDDE5960N> <@UDBGH9BMX>
thoughts?
Oh yeah, instantly knew what you were referring to, just thought it came up at Park. Guess it was just the nuances of tipping and working for tips, and pooling
Yup that sounds like what we talked a out at Park.
Never played a Borderlands game. Just missed the wave on it. Would probably enjoy it though
After that I'm not sure what I talked with you about anything
Wasn't the tipping conversation when we went back for my coat?
does everyone have a PC that could play it?
Was it? I don't believe it was
unsure
I could play it on my PC
I'm assuming you.
Dakota could
So might have been a follow up
So...CJ?
Dave
he can play league, so he does have a PC that isn't a potato
Nah because it was def the second time around because  you asked the bartender about tips, and I was curious how it worked separating the morning tips from the night ones
just don't know how good or bad it is
Cause I remember Gloomhaven being talked about the day on the bus when we were sober
Does that actually ping Victoria?
<@UDDE5960N>
I didn't realize the bar was open for brunch the first time I was there so wouldn't have asked
Interested in getting BL3 beat 1 and 2 but not pre sequel. Waiting for steam release not epic release. April I think?
Epic head band
What happened Aysh?
Huh, well shit, no idea from the infamous Naked and Famous night then
Someone called her a potato while trying to make a Gladys joke, but she didn't get it and took it personally. 
And her releash crashed and now she has to wait an extra 2 hours for it. 
And she doesn't drink and her friends all went home so she can't play a game to pass the time
GladOS?
It did ping me, why are the bots yelling at me?
I'm so lost
No I'm just done with today's adulting efforts and want to stop
Because some in history yelled at you and chose that message now
Now seems like a good day to plan the Saturday morning cartoons party
I know this isn't aysh because she doesn't drink, nice try mimic!
Why would I mind being called a potato. Potatoes are great.
I reach this point every day I adult
Graciassss
Well that's rude
So...once a week?
Nah, every other Tuesday unless it's a fifth Tuesday, then it's skipped
Generally multiple times a day!
I said she doesn't drink!
I've played BL1-2 with my brother. Waiting for 3 to go on a larger sale, not in a huge rush to play it
Good morning!
Get to the choppah!
The first 2 were phenomenal.  The game play of 2 was better, but I think the stories in 1 were the best
My favorite quest is still the claptrap DLC
Probably followed by Tiny Tina's DLC
Yeah the tiny Tina D&amp;D dlc was great
You have achieved Satanism level 1 good job
straight to the garbage
don't drink the devil coffee
you'll turn into a demon
:one:
Dunkin is better than Starbucks though
This place in WW is the best Master Homemade Donuts
The apple fritters literally have to have crack in them they're soooooo good!
yes you do!! dumb-ass.......
I understand
Morning
Already hating life
No on Valentine
I just have to bring you out for dinner!
How are you already hating life Mei?
I'm tired. Tummy hurts. I have work. What more do you need to hate life?
Yea that's fun!!!
That's not Valentines Day Plans though
This is a lost cause
I did not know we had :im-sorry-jon:
:smile:
whats a caddie?
The dude who follows the golfer around carrying the golf clubs and driving the golf cart
Hey Drew, were you working at Time Out last night?
Cause I was in the Fenway area after midnight and I was thinking of heading over cause I wasn't going to get to bed at a decent time anyway :smile:
Tiny Tina DLC was fantastic. I loved the base game
Presequel was... okay? It was BL2, but with some weird gimmicks tagged on and not as interesting of a story and not as punchy writing
it's call being prego
Yea it's why we gave up on playing it
Only another 2 months of that excuse!
Dave.... What were you doing last night?
:you-wouldnt-believe-the-things-ive-seen-kid:
I mean, it was worth a play to me. But not nearly as mindblowing as BL2
WTF kind of emoji is that
It feels like the "Nothing personal kid" stuff
Also you didn't answer my question as to what you were doing!
Isn't it kinda like the grizzled old war vet talking to the punk kid who thinks he knows the world
Feels more like a gum shoot than war vet
fair
But to answer the question: I had a pod outing at Lucky Strike last night. We had a pool room scheduled from 5-7. But we found out when we were leaving that Lucky Strike has unlimited arcade games from 8pm-2am every Thursday for $15. So we stayed for that
fairly sure that time out is not open after midnight anyway
ahhhhhh fancy
probably closes at 11pm or something
so definitely not open
Damn they close early
Oh, that's really early for a bar
I guess it's not *really* a bar
it's not a bar
that also serves alcohol as an afterthought
it's a high end cafeteria
lol
wait wait wait
`Lucky Strike has unlimited arcade games from 8pm-2am every Thursday for $15.`
That sounds amazing
I like sleep too much
Alright, it sounds amazing if you are in town
Yea, it's actually sick. We didn't even plan fo rit
I know what I'm doing on thursday
but when we were about to leave, they told us that and we were like O.o we can wait for an hour
And everything (except the key machine) is on.
key machine?
The one that gives you a PS4 once every 1500 plays
Ohhh well that makes sense.  Do they have other gift games on, that would be shocking
So it kinda is shocking
Cause all of the ticket machines are on
And the claw games
And ONE of the big prize games, but that one is kinda skill based and is also rigged. So you have to both be skilled and be the 1/1000 that wins
Whoa, now that is surprising. I may have to inform Mei of this because she loves winning prizes
The ticket machines aren't free though right?
They are tho
That's what's kinda mind boggling
I didn't think they would be. But my coworkers walked out with a bunch of prizes, including a full sized football, etc
A football that's $20 on amazon
(well, $17.50, but still)
wtf. every arcade that did that kind of deal separated out the ticket games from the other arcade games.
Yea, that's what I thought too. Literally everything (other than the key game, which said it was "out of order" was playable)
I'd be down to go with y'all next week
Play board games after work -&gt; Lucky Strike at 8
sorry I mean 6 months of post-prego issues excuses
another 3 months of post-prego issues and 20+ year of excuse called being a mother
Wait games are free?
I'm angry now
Valentine Day plan for us is massages!! You are the masseur.
I'm bored.............
What is the game store up here?
Pandemic?
game store? do you mean Pandemonium?
Yes thank you
:hby-a-cookie-but-he-was-so-hungry-he-had-to-have-some-hes-sorry:
You pay $15, but yea, free from 8-2am
so 15 dollar cover charge, for up to 6 hours of gaming
Which given that most games are like a dollar for 5 minutes means you pretty much make your money back in an hour
being a mother doesn't count, we're equal there
Uh oh
Non work political got itself in a fluff
Trump admin is thinking about forcing all government buildings to be Neoclassic via Executive order
something about nazis and brutalism
I like the way they just kinda feed on each other after a while
Oh, yea, totally
It's completely worth it even just for the regular arcade games
We played through a few of the shooter games and I was like "we probably would have spent about $10 in the past 5 minutes if we had been paying for this"
lol
You're just bad then dying that often
Gotta be quick on the trigger finger Dave
When you're not paying, you can really see how they cheat you. Like, almost all of the enemies give you a 2-3 second timer before they're about to shoot, but some of them appear half a second before they hit you
oh you mean time crisis?
Or how enemies will pop up, then the camera will instantly pan around to have your allies be right where the enemies are so you shoot them by reflex
Time Crisis actually only had 1 side working unfortunately so I didn't play it, but yea, games like that
Probably
Gotta go PEW PEW though
PEW PEW ALL THE THINGS!
Exactly, and that's how they get you
It's a lot more fun when you have unlimited credits tho :smile:
honestly, I could play deer hunter for hours
And now I want to play some FPS
But it does lose all your sense of danger
<#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey> outing to Lucky Strike next Thurs?
Deer Hunter? Really???
what FPS CJ?
possibly
First person shooter
I'm offended
seriously CJ?
????
You asked?
I most certainly did not
what FPS, CJ?
not what's FPS
Ooooooo
seriously CJ?
I thought it was what's
I'm offended
Probably CoD, could do some halo
do you have the new cod?
????
Warframe probably wouldn't scratch the itch too jumpy
No
Halooooo
I've played a decent amount of the new Modern Warfare
not what's FPS
so I'd hop on that if you did
also, I dislike any halo past 2
based on nothing substantial
YOU DON'T LIKE 3?!?!?!
None of the CoDs are on sale.... Ohhhh maybe some Titan fall! Also which MW are you referring too?
the latest one
like the newest cod
Ohhh it's on <http://Battle.net|Battle.net>
yep
I play on PC
cross platform
Fuck yea, that's how i'd play
never liked mouse and keyboard for FPS
technically the skill cap is higher, but I also prefer controllers
Usually requires weaker strength fingers
being a mother is more work.
This is an actual executive order? Or in consideration to be one?
I think it's in consideration right now
thats ridiculous!
That we would make it an executive order?
yes
of all things
people are dying
Aysh, I think you're confusing what Trump think is a bug vs. what is a feature
:bug:
No dakota, people dying is a feature to trump
:feature:
Did you have a busy day?
Yeah i've been busy the last couple weeks
You're on a new team right?
Yes and no? I have been writing a lot of code lately so I get pretty sucked in
Ohhhh fancy
Coding again
You said you're down the individual contributor route right?
Yeah, I tried my hand at managing and found it unrewarding
I like solving techincal problems, not people problems
That's good so you should be getting back into coding a lot more
I never stopped coding
I just started going to more meetings :lol:
Well that's true
And now meetings decrease
Hmm? I've been off the managment track for at least 6 months
/roll 2d20k-1 +5
What's the K
k determines advantage disadvantage or how many of the dice to keep starting from the top/bottom
there's also "exploding" die with !
/roll 10d6!
wait, why did it roll 12 times
cause I got 2 6s!
is that what exploding means?
they "exploded"
Yea every max die rolls another die of the same size
interesting
/roll 5f
I have no idea what "fudge dice" are but that's how you roll them
/roll 2%

hola

Perfect end to a Friday. :)
no apologies were made
<@UDL020K8D> (or anyone else):
Are there any board games that start as FULL coop and then go to competitive or the other way around?

I know there are some games that you kind of have to work together while also pursuing your own goals, but are there any that you have to work together like a real coop game before being competitive (not counting traitor mechanics like Betrayal)
It was useful to me. Saw it right as I got on the train. 
To the first bit, not that I know of. 
The train did stop at north station for me. 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long_Sucker|https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long_Sucker>
Maybe?
That is competitive from the start. 
Yea, there's no particular reason I'm asking, just curious bc I think it could be a cool mechanic. Dunno how it'd work exactly tho
So after a 10 minute argument today question for the group. Directions are move clockwise and your group is in a straight line. Do you go left to right or right to left?
I don’t understand the question. 
/roll d20+1
The directions your given are "Raise your hand in a clock wise direction". You are standing in a straight line with 3 people. Does the leftmost or right most person start?
There are three people at the table sitting all one one side in a line. . You are in the middle. Rules say play clockwise. Does the person to your left or right go second
If you are all facing the same direction it’s not really ambiguous. 
All facing same direction.
Then this is not ambiguous. 
If it unambiguous why won't you answer it
You pretend you have a circle with people facing in. 
Two of our gut reaction was to pass to the right. One player freaked the fuck out when we did so.
Pass right is wrong. 
So now its 3-2.5
Oh, know it's wrong, I was arguing that "pass to your right" as a first thought wasn't a "wtf are you talking about" kinda thing
Think about playing board fames. You always go clockwise, we’ve never had a problem. 
You never sit in a line playing boardgames
You could. Avalon we often sat in two lines. Never a problem. 
There is still a clear circular rotation there though
Still, you look at the clock from the outside for clockwise. Being in a line doesn’t change that. 
When you think about how a clock hand moves, it moves left to right
From that reference point, left to right could make sense.
No. How?
You stand on the outside of a clock and look in. What way does the hand pass you?
From right to left. 
Nah, not standing on the outside of a clock. Look at a clock face
That’s not how clockwise works. Don’t look down at the clock, look in at it. That’s how there is no ambiguity. 
I'd argue that clockwise doesn't apply to a line at all
Your interpretation would destroy games if you all sat on the same side of the table. 
This is a concept with a very fixed definition. 
Yes, there is an objectively right way to do so, but visualizing the clock and applying it to a line is not a thing that is necessarily easy for people to do.
:mastermind:
I just want going to being this up :grin:
For the record, Brian agrees with Drew/CJ/Doug
Yeah, because as Doug said, it's unambiguous, but somehow you looked at me as I was the moron
I still enjoyed the whole thing
wait, what? I keep reading this sentence and not being able to parse it at all.
Good morning!
Doug, unambiguous
<@UDDE5960N> the cackling opposite of Dakota
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UDBGH9BMX> counter clockwise
<@UHQD9J1SL> done with adulting
<@UDD45P5A9> no training required
<@UK7V13DS7> the devil of eggs
<@UPGVCMGD9> climbing the ranks
<@UETS9HTSS> student of the beer
<@UDTR9SLN4> she's got a ticket to ride
@Caroline Qu still needs to be invited to this slack
<@UEA7LHFQS> dead

<@UJTEHPEPL> out of state... So dead
<@UDKJNRKHA> missing
It was GREAT!
I mean you guys fought for like 15 minutes over the whole thing
Good morning!
Good morning :sun_with_face:
The moment I realized they were thinking of the clock center as behind us was when I lost it
Yea but that was the best part! And the best part is none of you could let it go
I mean you would think you guys were arguing over game deciding semantics instead of "who goes next" in a coop game
/roll d200
whoops
/roll d20
Booom NAT 20!
d100 is fine. Keep the 52. 
Noooooo I like the 20 out of 20
Players always want new rolls when they are better. 
smf oy
And it's not even a percentile it's a D200
Nice. 
You totally failed then. 
yup
I’m currently pitching a short campaign (3 sessions) for my blades group in the Savage Worlds system. That’s where those exploding dice you mentioned a couple days ago come from. 
Exploding dice seems like such a weird concept
Hi
:shocko:
:wave:
Hello friends!
Hello! We missed you and your evilness!
Oh and chaos monkey is... chaotic. Expect a very active slack, and only opt into bots once you know what they do
No one knows what the bots do anymore
THEY HAVE A LIFE OF THIER OWN!
Why would I let it go? It was such a fundamental part of games and I was in the right on multiple points. Why would I concede to the crazy?!?
We're the monkeys in type writers recreating the works of Hal9000
Oo yeah Im slowly learning the ways of this channel
also I haven't been evil in a while :wink:
is CJ O'stabby a bot?
it randomly replaces CJ's text with a bot about 20% of the time
you should be able to type `/bot list`  for a general idea of what things are going on behind the scenes
`/bot list`
its easier than every to know what they do
it makes sense for the system. when you skill up you don't change a modifier, you get a bigger die (d4 to d6, etc). exploding die balances that, ensuring that there is never a roll without some suspense.

Its the same as the bloodborne board game monster damage mechanic.
The bot system isn't perfect yet. You'll see odd interactions sometimes. I just need something else to procrastinate hard on enough to come back and fix the current bot messaging system.
I was saying it was fine bc Drew was so passionate about it :smile:
&gt; `Scrambler` Has a 15.0% chance to scramble Drew's message
15%?
haha, I wrote that on my phone and it must have auto corrected every word
It was something about "going from left to right"
Expect for how they all interact and get cranky with one another
technicaly it's 15%/n where n is count of words
mmmmm, that makes more cents
Oh, that would be a fun bot
That seems kinda silly, as I level up the game increases variance?
If it replaced words with their homonyms
For example a d4 has an average of 2.5 and 25% chance of exploding.  Where as a d10 has an average of 5.5 and a 10% chance of exploding
CJ, document your stuff!
totally doable. probably not all that hard in the end. We've done word search and replace for the censor bot.
But it seems hard doug! This is the first variable odds
Everything else is set
yeah, as you level up you become more a wild card (players are referred to as wild cards in the rules)
its just a line of text.
type in english
for english reading.
The annoyance would be that you'd probably have to have a list of words to replace, unless it can look online and return in a decent enough time
Make sure it's in LNRS though for translations
So like what's the point of this system? Being highly variant does not interest me.  I kinda like :dnd: because as you advance you become less variant
It's been updated
nice
Is that a bot that posts if nobody has posted in X hours?
nope
its not even really a bot.
It's a bot from <#CSZFZKGFK|dial_a_song>
ah, wait, no
don't post that.
LOL!
CJ
delete
Fine
Why do we not want to know the channel?
<@UETS9HTSS> told me not to let that be public
It's silly that it's a public channel then
Yea, you can make private channels
you can't trigger off private channels.
Ohhhh nifty I did not know that
before I had just store the token and was making manual URL calls.
its annoying
:sorry-link-i-can't-give-credit-come-back-when-you're-a-little-mmmmmmmm-richer:
<https://emoji.slack-edge.com/TDBEDSEQZ/sorry-link-i-can%2527t-give-credit-come-back-when-you%2527re-a-little-mmmmmmmm-richer/8247dc967d70bebe.gif>
I mean it kinda makes sense
Well excuse me, Princess!
I bet if you "invited" prometheus it would work
I have no idea how you invite the bot though
nope, already tried that
So if you use the prometheus user token, it should work
the one used for the prometheus reactions
that is a true user token
the API permissions just don't have the option to let the bot read private channels
Though you won't get events in that channel
I was saying more that if you added the server to the list of things that get the JSON file you should be able to have it react
I mean the slack API does some weird shit if you want it to
no, I read the list of permissions. that is not on the list
it will not read from private channels
That's surprising I guess because it's "private"
I have no idea where this reference is from? The cartoon Zelda?
CD-I
Interesting no wonder it's been pretty much ignored from Cannon
It's 3rd party wokr
Canon. Cannon is a weapon
yeah, canon. cannon is a weapon. I got a little confused when the top result for canon was the camera
canon is also a musical term, with a particular type (the perpetual canon) being a round.
Whoopies!
Does anyone (maybe <@UDC03KCGK>) know clothes/fashion well? I have what might be a really dumb question
Clothes go on your body, black goes with every color
I'm curious what your question is
Barney's NY is having a big closing sale. So I went in there and all of the jeans/pants were wayyyyy too long for me. But they only listed one size, not a WxL like normal jeans. Do they intend you to tailor them after you buy em?
You have used all available knowledge on this question
The width was correct, but the length was like, 4-5" too long
Akward, guys getting sized like ladies instead of by the numbers
typically when I see this, it's because the inseam length is included in the product name
like, each inseam length is considered a different product
Jean's are never designed to need tailoring, trousers/pants can be
Really? In the product name? That's crazy
Hmmmm not a fan of it triggering twice in a row
it's not super common, but when I buy my climbing pants, I need to look for the inseam in the product name before looking at waist
can't speak to barneys though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Thanks, that's what I thought going into it, but none of them had lengths (that I could see) and they all seemed far longer than what almost anyone would wear
Especially with a 29 waist
your short
you're*
Now you look like a precog
haha, I was looking through my message wondering where I used "your"
Now you look like a precog
Wow, that was like, a 20s delay. Is the bot server borking?
Bork bork bork
that's probability for you
it has very little ram. its easy for it to get delayed.
ah, so I guess an external network connection wouldn't work too well for the homonym code
True but that's 1/100 chance
yup. that's probability for you.
Too much typing makes the machine :slowpoke:
Today is such a quiet and boring monday
my teammate brought a tonne of snacks to sprint kickoff and  I ate it all so now my stomach feels like its full of lead :smile:
Did you save any for anyone else Aysh?
yes but only because he brought like- 6 bags
Well i'm impressed that was the detering factor for you
Was bag number 6
living like a true hedonist : )
Liesss hedonism needs booze!
And massive orgies
no the meeting also ended in an hour so i could only take so much before running to the next meeting
But I think that's it
................i think ill pass , CJ
See this is why your just gluttonous and not hedonistic
I'm having a blast at the RMV
This is why I have a AAA membership
Hedonism needs things you enjoy. If you don't enjoy booze, then what would be the point of drinking?
Aysh you just didn't take a bag for yourself on the way out
You probably shouldn't mention explosions in government buildings
Yea dakota don't mention how _your dice explode_ and the _triggering mechanism for the explosion_
I don't have a car :lol:
Are you just getting an ID?
No I'm transffering my license
make sure it's the kind of ID that can be used on planes in like 5 months
you need a real id these days
Yup
Is this a real card
Doug is correct
they translated it to chinese and back a couple times.
You can go back to being a hedonist without the massive orgies.  Why I have no idea
So it's a real card that's been though the google translator a couple of times.  Neat

<https://offspring.lifehacker.com/how-to-politely-get-a-toddler-to-leave-you-alone-1841518643>
thank you- i do appreciate that
oh man, I love when toddlers ask questions. its so fun to see how their brains work.
my sunday: Woke up at noon- got out of bed at 2 pm. struggled with a migraine till 7 pm and took a pill that worked at 9 pm. Slept at 10 pm.
Watched an entire season of a Netflix show though
and you get to nonsense with them better than anyone else
i can pretend to be one if you like it so much
I'm open to the attempt, but I have found it difficult to replicate.
:slightly_smiling_face:
because you didnt try hard enough
Clearly someone didn't ask you "Why?" Enough times in arow
then again, I don't havve toddlers in my life enough that I need to know how to extricate myself from one.
I will!
how
oh, defeating a chain of "why"s is easy
keep answering
WTF DID YOU DO?!!?!?
it only takes like 6 questions until you hit philosohpical bedrock
how
lol
Clearly  you're not explaining things well enough to hit that at 6
nothing, basically. I did eat- i didnt forget to eat
btu how
Damn son that got philosophical
I need a version of the above article for friendly doggies
Yes but Aysh, how did you get a migraine like that, and is it why you slept so much?
Fetch
Which an auto thrower
i think the migraine was a result of going to lseep with my hair wet. and not eating till 3 pm
<https://lifehacker.com/c/loner-week>

:heart:
so like you start with:
&gt; A: time to eat
&gt; T: why
&gt; A: because you need food to live
&gt; T: why
&gt; A: because nature is a cold unfeeling void that rewards only consumption
&gt; T: why
&gt; A: either because god is cruel, or because he doesn't exist and we each contain a portion of the heat death of the universe
Wet hair seems like such an interesting reason for a headache
&gt; T: WHY?!?!?!
like- a sinus induced headache
&gt;  A: beans
what is a god
&gt;  a story people tell themselves to be good
what is death
oh can i hear the story? i love stories1
&gt; Why??????
i want the story!
I probably shouldn't type all that. so much happening today I still haven't eaten my lunch.
Go eat lunch doug!
EAT
because you need food to live
because nature is a cold unfeeling void that rewards only consumption
either because god is cruel, or because he doesn't exist and we each contain a portion of the heat death of the universe
Soooooo Aysh is a loner? But you seem like the polar opposite
looks useful
Im not a loner but i do have mood swings
I think
I dont know
i dont introspect
what if i find something i dont like?
what will i tell my mom?
That I get, I still don't get the correlation to wet hair.  Also not eating is bad
I feel like Aysh's mind is somehow scarier and more chaotic than mine
how does your mom figure in? like not knowing if she'd approve of your partner?
I MISS PLAYING GAMES WITH YOU AYSH!!!!
What indian mother approves of a partner unless he's rich, of the right religion, and has a respectable career.  Also in an appropriate amount of time bless her with grandbabies.
I don't know that I'd want to generalize on a whole {race//collection of peoples} like that.
I mean really, you generalize that to most Asian cultures, `respectable career` is option in some though
no- my mom would not approve of her daughter  not being perfect in her eyes- where di a partner come in?
Doug added it, I ran with it
But you being perfect is generally a bid to marry you off isn't it?
oh, I thought it was a series of new thoughts, all on being a loner. You were adding thoughts to not introspecting
I see now
my mistake
..........no CJ. Its a bid to claim her place as supreme mother
Aysh's stream of conscious can only be tamed by those that ride chaos
Yes Aysh, and what Supreme mother has an unmarried spinster daughter
Really Aysh
lollll maybe in 10 years thatll come up
who wants to travel to the Azores this march? :heart:
my week is actually kinda free :smile:
:hand:
good- gather the masses
Well duhhhh, but it will start sooner than that.  Once you start getting towards the old maid age it'll be "Why can't you find a nice man and settle down for grandchildren?"
That's the nice version
@masses
Soooo wednesday?
Masses have arrived
:pylon:
but do they want to go to the azores?
rally the crowd
Pretty sure the preggo lady would murder me if I abandon her in march
also- the 'respectable career' is the only one that would apply if i know my mom right
but- would you want your future daughter not having a respectable career? would you!
This is your partner's career not yours
FINE CJ
hey, now we actually have the masses
would you not consider the partner of your child your child as well????
less all we need out of the female is a decent job that shows a modicum of intelligence
+ <@UTFFJEJ6P>, she's not on the obnoxious list thing
`tonne`
yeah, a tonne of snack is roughly 1.1 tons of snacks
Nahhhh girls and guys have different standards, so you get held as a daughter not a son
oooh, so Dakota, how did you get the proof of citizenship and proof of residency?
i would certainly hope not
1. Say "why do you think?" and that shuts them up pretty easily. Or leads to an interesting conversation
2. I like toddlers well enough. It's just babbies that can't move on their own/die if I look at them wrong that I'm scared of
????? I mean we're going with stereotypical right?
TONNE!
It's only 3PM!!!!!!
The Azores sound delightful
There's lots of people not on our obnoxious list.  We mostly keep it around so we can keep track of threads when we have real work to do.
lets us go to the azores- its just a 4 hour DIRECT flight away
yes!
Uggggg I would love to but I am already taking random time in Jan/Feb/April so I would feel guilty.
Random time?
she take off 30 minutes on a tuesday afternoon approximately 1-3 times per month
guilt is a bad emotion. delete.
Aysh, teach me how to delete emotions
I have only been there since October and I took 3 days in Jan, and 2 in Feb and will be taking at least one in April
just 1 weekend + 2 days on either side  ? :pls:
So comparing it to the rest of the company it feels weird. I typically like to run away for a month at a time
You and Mei both
I like taking random long weekends
same here cj
No about a week gone in Jan (3 work days) and 2 days in Feb, so like a week of vacation
I really enjoyed when I took off all the Wednesdays in a month. I'd do that again, except then I can't really travel
I would take off all mondays
I would but I am still new and shiny
I dunno, 2 day work weeks, sounds phenomenal for a month
October is not new and shiny, you've been there for almost half a year
If you're still new and shiny there's serious problems!
i like weekends too
God I can't wait to not come back here for another 5 years
hmm?
5 years?
Such an odd reference Dakota
It's how long my last license lasted.
Ohhh right RMV
Oh shit I'm in a thread
:smile:
stay in thread dakota
Birth certificate, bill, lease
OMG its Dakota!!!!
Read thread! No passport, can't go
GET PASSPORT
YOU'RE only 3PM
Fancy
Today has dragggggggeeeeeedddddd on sooooooo slowly
YOUR day has dragged on?!?!
I just left the RMV
FINALLY
It's all relative. Life is maya and chaya.
Yea but you could haven't been dicking around on your phone
tree spinach?
Causing Mayhem in <#CDR5ZBTT7|chaos_monkey>
I have to look busy
WHICH IS THE WORST
Basically I'm saying that Dakota while stuck at the RMV still could do something with his time
Meh, id rather be at work.
did you bring a nintendo switch with you?
No, I should have...
Sooo you went to the RMV unprepared
Well the online site said no wait....
&gt; Sooo you went to the RMV unprepared
I mean it was my first time
Didn't they have this nonsense out west?
I went to a DMV when I was like 16. Walked in, took a test, walked out. No super long wait
Well, that's not how we do it out here
Only pain and suffering is to be had beyond those doors
nah, I've had pretty quick visits in MA
but I always still go prepared with an audiobook or something
_*ONLY PAIN AND SUFFERING*_
In Indiana I got to schedule a time. worked perfectly. Was always a mess in Michigan
my 2 visits to the DMV in boston were both very quick
What are you grateful for today?
<@UDC4QL95G> how could it have taken that long? I was in at 9:30, out by 11:30
Did you not have forms and stuff?
Oooh, so you did find your BC
I had everything
My analyst knows me well after 18 months, breaking in new people is hard.....
How could it have taken so long then?
prove it; what's your social security number?
finally! good :slightly_smiling_face:
Also your last 3 residencies and any alias
I was waiting for my damn number to be called
and your mother's maiden name
Passports are sooooo worth it
it only just not occurred to me how religious that term is
No she's been broken in for a while
I had to deal with a new person today
Howso?
also many people now don't change their names. Its the worst security question.
or give their kid the maiden name as a middle name
I couldn't buy beer without a passport when I moved here
...................... tell me positive things CJ
They last 10 years, they count as all forms of ID (AKA you only ever need to show your passport)
<https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2020-02/10/1/asset/fd1b167df594/anigif_sub-buzz-559-1581299842-13.gif>
Look how happy
also you never know when you have a sudden itch to leave the country on a whim
So no worries about BC/SS/Photo ID, passport is all that and more
I've never had my driver's license not work
What Doug said
You said what I was grateful for
Not positive things
They didn't like my Indiana license anywhere in Dorchester.
And there is 0 chance I leave the country on a whim
You mean like going to the Azores in march
Or canada, I mean it's America's Hat! Gotta go there on a whim
I'm the guy who has never even been to New York
interesting is that the guy who won the oscar for parasite?
:facepalm:
yes- who won 4  to be exact
Dakota have you only ever been where you live?
Fancy I didn't even know there was a movie called Parasite this year
UFFF probably because it is south Korean
its an INCREDIBLE movie though
Aren't these suppose to be movies in theaters? You know so I can see them!
they were :smile: theyll probably come back now  that its got validation from the Oscards :tm:
Nah, ive gone on vacations with family around the country. I've also gone skiing a couple times on the east cost
Seee so it totally counts that I have no idea what you're talking about
My point still stands!
they are still showing it in Davis
you could go see it
Well that's redeeming
Everyone was saying it's amazing, and given the trailer, I'm fairly certain there's this dark secret that'll make me really scared
Or grossed/freaked out
lol
Cause the trailer definitely ISN'T for "one of the best movies I've ever watched", but I think that's intentional
I saw a trailer for it on youtube
You can't get into my building without a passport
Really?
crazy
so dakota- you DONT want to go to the azores? is that it?
Th
huh
oh
Also probably a decent way to keep the rift raft out
I don't know what the Azores are
:cry: please
I mean you already have doug and brenden it sounds like
<@UDC4QL95G> its the hawaii of the atlantic
owned by Portugal
islands righty between the US and West Africa
hawai of the atlantic, iceland of the 2020s
I have an oculus quest,  its a lot of fun. However, I need to return it (it was a gift)  because it gives me terrible headfaches about 15 seconds after i put it on.
awww that sucks
I've heard that happens to some people with 3D stuff in general
Yea that's why the 3D TVs had trouble no one wants to watch something that makes them nauseous
was so nice that the 3DS let you set the 3D depth, or turn it off. I found I generally turned the 3D off after halh an hour.
I AM NOT ENTERTAINED
get in loser, we're going shopping
woah, things just took a hard right turn
that is hilarious :smile:
Not what I wanted, but too amazing not to share
the people around me who speak my language has grown from just me to about 4 others in the last 2 weeks. now i cannot call my tamil- speaking friends and rant
I mean you can...just more people will understand you
like 25% of OMS architecture was figured out in Greek. Nik and Dimitris would start hashing things out and always flipped over at some point.
That's kinda funny
Everyone around me always knows what I'm saying
its the best thing about being bi-lingual
We didn’t get any follow up on this. Was it a reference? Did you go shopping?
its from mean girls
Been a while since I’ve seen it. 
Ah, that always happens on mobile. 
<@UETS9HTSS> Everspace kinda sucks on a controller
I wouldn't know, I always used keyboard/mouse
Play on joystick and throttle. Friend on mine bought a whole setup for elite dangerous. 
H.o.t.a.s.
It.... was a bit much. Game worked fine on a keyboard and mouse. 
Yea, the game recommends keyboard/mouse, which is much better. Just means I can't play it on my living room pc
Funny, since it looks like the game is on ps4 and switch as well. 
I mean, it *is* playable on controller. But the game recommends m&amp;kb and so would I after playing both
It's significantly harder on controller and almost impossible to shoot down missiles bc of the auto aim
Oof.  
ED with VR on a flight stick tho... THAT was really cool. The game kinda sucked, but it was cool for 5 hrs
I'm down, sign me up! Don't need days off, I just take them
And then don't get paid
Cause...yeah
Don't talk to me about slow days. No wants to go grab a drink during a rainy windy day
Damn man, you were there a long time
Ok I'm asking for real , channel creation will be done if serious
Ewwww boring day
I read that as "she's been broken for a while"
Real
No thanks. I'll sit this one out
Morning
Summon the Silent
Pinged a dude yesterday, he said he's out of the office due to unexpected PTO. I thought he was just taking a sick day. Pinged him again today, he's now out of the country
Oddly relevant to Doug's `"you never know when you have a sudden itch to leave the country on a whim"`
THE END IS NIGH DAKOTA IS UP EARLY!
lol
Seems silly to not be like, outta town good luck!
Yay sweet relief+
Was the dude from another country?
Also Dakota, that's a sign
Don't really know where he's from. I assume so
After being trapped at the DMV all day yesterday, I need to make up some time
I was actually at work for an hour before that wakeup call, but I didn't wanna ping people _too_ early
WTF THE SKY IS FALLING!!! WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!
I mean, death is a fact of life, we will all one day die
Damn, Dakota being up this early is definitely a sign of things to come. Next thing you know CJ will have a kid
I actually like mornings. I am far more productive. I just HATE waking up
so far, Aysh, Brenden, Drew, myself.
Don't let Marissa off the hook, drag her in too!
CJ- just so you know- if you dont gi now you cant travel ANYWHERE for about 2 years
gi?
*go
:oh: :duh: I thought gi was short for something
Aysh, I just want to tell you. Mei will _never_ allow that to happen. There's grandparents for a reason
DANG IT
I SEE AN AYSH RELEASE NOTE!!!!
Deleting stuff from tblProductOption!
Really nice try, but I agreed to certain requirements when I started dating Mei.  One of them being an international trip a year
My team's app releases tomorrow, I don't know if we're writing official release notes or not. I should check.
yeah we just deleted 10 million ish rows of core product data, so if the site breaks and 1/4th of our products dont looke right----thats on meeeee
:big-f:
that's a fair chunk of dta
all im saying is, make it 2
We shall see, I'm not going to complain either way
that's not a lot of emojis
:hby-jira:
all I'm seeing is that its an action thriller (musical of course). not seeing a plot trailer.
because trailers shouldnt give away plots
not to give away the plot. premise, that's what I should have said. the one sentence to see if you're interested.
also i dont think a trailer has been released - only posters
BORED
Boooo
Go delete more stuf
lunch done
snack done
extra snack done
 WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FORWARD TO?
Dinner?
what are you doing after work?
Dinner!!!
Lol DND
sounds like worth looking forward to
can snack plenty there
Nice!
cast _Create Food and Water_ and make it rain snacks
or _Goodberry_ for healthy snacking
Lol
Doug- do you agree? <https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/north-end-boston-love-letter-36712990>
without reading the article, I will agree to the premise.
with the caveat of when I have to deal with sport games getting out.
but even that is really on the border of the North end.
I've now twice run past men reliving themselves in public after basketball games. Not really a North End problem so much as a TD garden problem . but still gross. There is a school across the street so I think that can technically get you registered as a sex offender, even if its off-hours.
Ew
oh, this author is like one block away from me
That's a weird way for the article's title to spell "The Alewife Area"
Alewife is a million miles away from everything. I worked there for a month or two. commute sucked, even if it only used a single train
Felt the same way about being out in brookline (1 stop before where Drew lives currently)
It used to be a single train?
agreed
Yea, the commute isn't the best. But I hate cities, so it's so much nicer for me out there
I mean no switching trains
next snack has been edibiled
One time I was bored in my programming class
So I wrote out the entire lyrics to that song in my notebook
Wow
I used to do that in exams in school. Once I wrote an Aqua song that went 'tell me the words, cuz I dont understand'...My teacher saw it and thought I was trying to cheat and get answers from someone. I had to sing the song to her.
that;s awesome
Ohhhhhh man that's epic
Alewife is farther from things than Brighton
Sooooo Aysh now needs to sing for us
Because I can get to Harvard Ave or Coolidge Corner easily. Even Fenway
Booo, :mocking-spongebob: doesn't work
not in threads.
I put it top level too though
hm, that should have worked then.
:sadpotato:
wrong spongebob mock
HAHAHAH
there's more than one
ok, I'll add the other one to the list
I totally forgot about that bot. I
HAHAHAH
there's more than one
oh also it will only post if the thread is empty
so anything with a thread already is immune
immune
Why is Dave mocking me :disappointed:
SO MANY RULES
I uSeD tO dO tHaT iN eXaMs In ScHoOl. oNcE i WrOtE aN aQuA sOnG tHaT wEnT 'TeLl Me ThE wOrDs, cUz I dOnT uNdErStAnD'...mY tEaChEr SaW iT aNd ThOuGhT i WaS tRyInG tO cHeAt AnD gEt AnSwErS fRoM sOmEoNe. i HaD tO sInG tHe SoNg To HeR.
I wanted to see how that would look
it looks terrible
We have <#CDU145F08|megamoji_test_channel> for that
Not <#CH0TUPU6R|secret>
:shrug2: :sorry:
i saw that :stuck_out_tongue:
Anyone but Aysh!
I think I made Summon the Silent in Secret
cuz megamoji test channel became popular
You made some bots against me
That's why you keep making them
Dave, join us to the Azores
This is why i periodically check the slack channels to find what you're trying to hide from me Dakota
I also made /cast faster now
still doesn't _do_ anything
Doesn't give me any errors
HAHAHAH
Azores?
yes the azores
<@UDBGH9BMX>
Which bot? There's two SpongeBob ones?
What about the Azores? Other than the fact that the name looks like Azeroth
We're planning on going. Aysh is inviting you on the trip
Ah, just saw that thread, responding in there
1. Why the Azores over anywhere else?
2. Why March over warmer months?
3. Heck yea, if this is happening I'm in, thanks for the invite! Just have to update my passport cause my current one is expired
1. direct flights, relatively new and unknown so less crowds and cheaper
2. beginning of good weather, but just outside peak season. so still good 
3. How long will it take, do it!
:fair: I don't really have a list of places where I'd want to go, but I'd never heard of Azores haha. I'm always down for trying new things tho
I'm just down for travel
Not too much chaos today
Lots of meetings today
I just want to be lazy
What are you doing today?
my new report is being a bit .....lackadaisical about work
Ewwwww
That is not fun
As in work isn't getting done on time, or that it's getting done wrong?
didnt get done in time- didnt really inform us....laptop went bust and didnt tell us he needed time to set up him dev env again....
not sure when it should go from 'he's new!' to 'he's  needs to improve'
Those sound like 'he needs to improve' because those are massive issues he's not communicating
looked up the etymology of lackadaisical because its a great word:
&gt; a ludicrous alteration of _lack-a-day_ (1690s), an exclamation of sorrow or regret, from _alack the day_ (1590s). Hence, "given to crying 'lack-a-day,' vapidly sentimental." Sense probably altered by influence of *lax*.
yeah, not telling people your computer died, hard to see how that's just a newbie thing.
Got don't with work. Going grocery shopping now
The only argument i could see for new is he didn't know how to tell you those things
aka, I should wait till my 1 on 1 or something else silly
THAT'S THE WORD OF THE DAY!?!?!
d o do
?
whats the word of the day?
doug, im unable to parse that sentencew
some thing
I think not speaking up about the computer is a worrying sign
that sentence?
no he mentioned it- but didnt tell us when we were planning the spring that he needs to reset everything (nor after, i  found out from a standup update)
, the etymology
i have a 1-1 with him tomorrow and im going to ask him to communicate these things in time + ask if he needs more onboarding
oh, that one. The original usage was describing the kind of person who would sit around saying "alack the day" or basically "today sucks."
oh....me
but then the sound of the word merged with the unrelated work lax, which just sounds the same, and makes the new meaning.
I'm assuming you're probably not quite so lackadaisical with your work
:notsureif: scramble
I made a really funny joke but one a small subset of the world's population will get it, but it was REALLY funny you all :disappointed:
What's the joke?
NOW I NEED TO KNOW AYSH!
its impossible to translate :disappointed:
Lame
New Hampshire results starting to come in. 
And?
Bernie leading so far, like in 2016. Yang dropped out. 
23% reported
/roll 1d100
Bannet dropped out. 
Wow lots of drop outs
Warren is still in?
Yeah, but probably getting 4th, so race is probably over for her. She may drop out tomorrow. We’ll see. 
Good morning!
<@UTFFJEJ6P> this is just a randomly started morning ritual. Embrace the chaos!
<@UDC4QL95G> renewed his license, but scared of passports. 
<@UDC4QL95G> birthday boy!
<@UDDE5960N> stuck in meetings so can't break in the new minion
<@UK7V13DS7> cheap date by nature
<@UDBGH9BMX> planning a very active 2 months
<@UETS9HTSS> already planned and executing on a busy couple months
<@UHQD9J1SL> the combination of random thoughts, plus drive to execution
Doug, proud of the North end
<@UPGVCMGD9> showing up late, but still showing up
<@UDD45P5A9> offers insight when prodded
<@UDTR9SLN4> her paper about the chaos channel experiment is coming along swimmingly
<@UDKJNRKHA> the chaos was too much
<@UDBV9N1E0> slightly worried about him to be honest
<@UEA7LHFQS> never embraced the chaos
<@UE2D3HCBW> an unknown figure that occasionally makes a comment revealing the true lurker nature. 
<@UJTEHPEPL> embraced the chaos...then moved
It's <@UDC4QL95G> birthday??? There must be extra celebrating
Would May be too late? And how long a trip? Long weekend?
Pings, pings for Dakota!
Auto correct
Once for each year of life?
Yep
Hip hip, ping! <@UDC4QL95G>
Well he's definitely not 5, I think we will need some help with the pings
Soooo many pings
All I know is that since we're doing games night on Dakota's birthday, we must make sure he wins 0 games tonight. ONLY CARNAGE SHALL BE HAD!
Hello Dakota! What's up!
Booooooo
Stupid botify making Chaos Seed ping me
hi
I mean we are playing with Brenden, It's already a given that we all lose
LIES!!!!
I hold my own!
anyone else heard rumors of layoffs?
Nope
the current expected number is 900 employees
the whole service org is going through a major rework next week
Interesting
according to the rumors
Oh yea, I knew that. Happy birthday Dakota!
Knew about the service org rework, we're losing a part of our group
The big reorg _could_ spawn rumors of layoffs.
Why layoffs? Are departments/the company not doing well?
:waythrifty:
they hired like we were growing at 40%
narrator: we weren't
Ehhhh I see cost cutting coming down the pike because we've seen the growth drop
apparently Q1 numbers are abysmal
Ohhhhh?
outside of cyber 5
That part I missed
Cyber 5 isn't Q1
<@UDC4QL95G>
<@UDC4QL95G>
<@UDC4QL95G>
Happy Birthday
<@UDC4QL95G>
Uhoh, is this where I panic sell and then get busted for insider trading and go to jail for years?
uhh, how do you panic sell
this isn't an open trading window
You're not allowed to sell so no
When's our next investor call?
I hate they way they inform us here
ahhhh the 28th
Yea, I know, I was hoping nobody would call me out on my joke like that
I could have said "panic buy puts on Robinhood"
Boom too slow
That would probably get you nailed though
God knows Robinhood will let anything happen
Well any broker would *probably* let it happen unless they know my employment
That seems weird given the company's success
Oh, well, yeah, that part was obvious
Yes
Also that's why there is a lock on the trade window for you. To prevent you from doing something dumb like that
How do they make money exactly?
This is the dangerous part of me being in this slack. To be fair, I have like 6 shares
Though you can set it up to sell before earnings
The FCC is gonna get you
Let me know if you want to be a co-author on my paper! You'll get an Erdos number of 5 out of it!
Also, if you have an Erdos number of 2 or less, please let me know.
<@UDC4QL95G> Happy birthday
Haha, no I have no renown in the math world deserving of an Erdos number before this one
Oh the hypocrisy
If they find me, I'm bringing you down with me
I saw the musical last week. "I'm a mouse" led into a song, and they totally missed out on the "duh."
Same for Janice's trust fall
This is where I'm reminded I don't actually know the year he was born. I'm guessing today marks the 26th
We just need to keep going until he tells us to stop at the right age <@UDC4QL95G>
Maybe he's actually 52 who knows
He is babby
So probably 23
You think he's counting? Half the time I forget my own age until I run my ID through the scanner to test it
Dave, he's definitely older than 23
:blob-doubt:
He's been at Wayfair since 2016
Ya'll can figure that one out easily
He's been at 2016 since Wayfair
:nailed-it:
ive definitely heard these rumors from multiple sources
so apparently "curry" has a blanket ban in our galway office
interesting fact of the day
wow, thats not racist at all
can we ban fish?
Well, not really: someone has a severe airbourne allergy to the folowing:
&gt; Coriander
&gt; Curry (All variations at present)
&gt; Curcuma
&gt; Turmeric
I like fish, but if you bring fish into the office you are a monster
/roll 1d20+6
/roll 1d20+6
I fail
for a long time (possibly still ongoing) there was a ban on melons in the 4th floor on Copley
i know someone who gets annoyed at heavy perfume but regularly microwaves fish and brings it into lunch meetings
Quick question, the bot list says 20% of a saving throw. What's the other 80%? <@UDL020K8D>
history's greatest monster
Oohhh interesting. We are shifing our focus away from improving NPS and more towards being cost effective. That is probably where the layoffs are coming from
then its an ability check
Isn't it great to watch all corporations go the same route?
someone I know- high up + heard from higers ups (SF ENG) asked me to cancel a celebratory ERG event because itll be too soon after....
grim
ERG event?
"We're a plucky startup, let's do it better, and focus on quality, and make customers happy!"
"We're a corporation now. Profit!"
Oh man I really hope there are some activism folks in this meeting right now.
"Not every cusotmer, order, and interaction are equally valuable. Segemt customers based on lifetime value..."
huh?
employee resource group, mine is a brown people community
There is a meeting on the service STO regorg happening now
ohhhh
and the motiviations behind it, and plans for the future
My greatest peeve with that was that for some reason, the conclusion was reached that we would not have fruit in the 4th floor kitchens. We could go to other floors to get it, and we could also eat it on the 4th floor. Which had nothing to do with melons, which were supposed to be banned for the whole building
None of it made any damn sense
? melons were not banned from the whole building as far as I knew. The fridges on 4 had special anti-melon signs
Right, that was the problem
Person with severe melon allergy would still be on other floors from time to time
My greater gripe being, that other fruit had nothing to do with it. Somehow this was still the decision to remove it from the 4th floor because....???
melons were banned in the whole building when i joined- september 2018
Yep, but for the longest time, the postings were just the 4th floor
It was wacky
I did not know melons were banner from the whole building. good thing I don't tend to bring melon into the office.
i was sent an edible arrangement that was returned by reception :confused:
Again, nothing about it made sense.
I'm pretty sure Watermelon was ok, which was the craziest part
Well to give perspective on dakota's age, he was complaining about how star market doesn't take people under 23 for Out of state IDS
The melon thing was because there was a person on 4 with the severe airborne melon allergy and when they worked in the office, rarely went to other floors. They sat near me for a year or so and was able to find other fruits on the floor
Why hire 40% more people and then re-org...
Also, how do you know about that meeting <@UDC4QL95G>?
I was invited to it
:wow:
WOW that is the best thing I've seen you say Aysh
I would assume he's in it
Yea, I thought that, but I didn't realize Dakota was so senior
there was a wide range of people invited. I got it as well, and ignored it.
Maybe they only invited ppl who aren't getting "re-org'd" :nervous:
its true though :smile:
<https://www.thelayoff.com/t/13q0Lugq>
Layoff speculation is rampant!
I clearly have become immune to this kind of stuff after CVS
:nervous:-intensifies
my AD has his calendar open and he has a meeting on his calendar tomorrow about 'staffing and headcount'
I don't disagree I just love the way you say it
'speculation' isnt the right word any morew
Well clearly you're not on the chopping block
Because that would just be a dick move, "Hey no celebrations because of Layoffs, BTW you're done here"
Speculation is still accurate, we're still speculating what's going to happen
You can speculate about the superbowl, even though you know it's happening
my worry is warranted- is all
:time-to-update-resume:
Agreed
Apparently there's a power and Fire test tonight in our buidling?
Installing those Dr. Evil plates below people's desks? Straight to the furnace with you and Will Ferrell!
Well government contractors are always hiring engineers, just need to be a citizen (sorry Aysh)
Holy crap, what happens to the hundreds/thousands of visa workers if wf does layoffs...
Do they just get straight up deported if they can't find a job in a few weeks?
Yes
yes
Man. That really suckx
That's...kind of a sadly depressingly relevant Buzzfeed headline
on my visa, i have 60 days to start another job.
it also takes 30 days to transfer the visa from one employer to another.
You can probably file for an extension if your in the process of moving the visa over
i think youll still need to leave the country
some companies let you work when that transfer is in process but not all
Awwww boooooo
So wait, which thursday do we think there will be an announcement?
tomorrow
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wonder if that's why reviews were punted to Friday?
yes
Damn sonnnnnn
Aysh why are you so well connected?!?!?!
```'Employee assistance will be on site tomorrow to help people with processing.'```
i just stalked someone's calendar that I know is open
What a silly L5/L6
Man and I just got my L1 settled down over all the changes
Now I'm gonna have to settle her down with Layoffs
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Corin isnt SILLY CJ!
That's ridiculous
Corin is silly if he lets you see that kind of stuff
:uhoh:
That was a deja vu
I know, I was responding to both that and what CJ/Aysh were talking about
Wait I can't get into the actual meetings
I'm L3. Not sure if you consider that Senior or not.
Yea I would say that coring blocking off 2 days on his calendar is kinda a red flag
Does anyone know how it works?
Basically. How red though? Like hey "Sales and service going to get real trimmed down!"
or
"Hey, we're tightening the belt across the board. No org is safe!"
My L5 has a normal looking schedule tomorrow, so I'm guessing this is Engineering focused
1 sec, let me use my email powers to read through Niraj's inbox
lol
...wait, you can do that without getting flagged?!??!
uhhhh _maybe_
More the former than the later, Aysh has been getting a lot of nasty emails I haven't been
They gave Dakota god powers
the meeting I mentioned is betweel L5/L6 on eng + product...and its today\ not tomorrow
ON PURPOSE!
considering I wrote the app that is allowed to do that, and the dude that set up the permissions no longer works at wayfair? Yeah pretty much for sure
I knew they gave him godly powers, I just didn't realize that there was NO MONITORING on said powers
I AM THE GODLY POWER
I get that Aysh, but then Corin cleared out tomorrow and Friday from meetings
cuz I sure as hell didn't set up any monitoring
Redacted really took away the emphasis on "N O"
With GIANT BUSY BLOCKS
i can open and see attendees and description. Please, above message was not from a meeting, btu from someone else
which means he's gonna be busy doing non-work stuff
Ohhhhhhhhh ok
Aysh seems to have the most info - do we have any info? Some other ppl I'm talking to (using vague terms since it's a wf slack chat) are also :nervous:
:popcorn:
Sorry if that makes me a dick
haha, understandable
Part of me wants to troll people but I probably should stir up :panic2:
this is everything i know
I'm like 90% sure we are laying off people in call centers. PMs, anaylsts, engineers etc are likely safe
I mean it syncs with the bullshit reasoning that talent put out
Well, being able to see what comes out of Dakota's sleuthing is like watching a movie. The drama, it is so intense!
but but but, you can confirm that 10%...
I mean, if he has access to Niraj's emails...

:smile:
I doubt it affects my org since our Promo's went through
considering the meeting i mentioned is abou merchandising engineering, i dont think  thats 100% accurate
The powers, they are there. The knowledge, it is attainable
STEAL THE GOLDEN FIGURE!
No point in promoting someone who's getting laid off
Unless you're evil
Don't be evil
Also, oddly I've gotten a crap ton of Linked In visits from Wayfairians over the last week or so.
No that's way beyond evil
That's just a level of lazy that's dumb
I should really make a LinkedIn
Laziness is beyond maliciousness?
Like, someone's lack of care is more sinister than someone's deliberate actions?
Basically a philosophical question.
YOU DON'T HAVE ONE!?!?!?
No I'm saying that calibration is a bitch for everyone involved, you don't calibrate people you're going to lay off unless your _that_ inept, which wayfair hasn't demonstrated
Corporate yes, inept no
That's what I'm saying! I went from "I hope my friends are ok, this is sad news"
to
"There...there's a way to know for sure. The knowledge is out there. I seek answers!"
Wayfair regularly sent out entire trucks with a single bed on them
They also would hire trucks and fail to cut them, fearing a couple hundred dollar penalty over you know, the thousands it cost to hire an under utilized truck
They sent a pizza oven to Hawaii
lol
Need I go on?
You're picking out all shipping issues
Not HR
:nope-nope:
I'm just picking out the examples of ineptitude I could observe while I was there. Could also pick finance ones if you like
The HR one I have is they worked a contract employee 80 hours one week instead of just hiring another person or spreading the hours. He got double time due to TX law
They did this multiple weeks in a row
I mean if you think they're so inept they don't know who they're laying off so they spend hours talking about them.  That's your choice
This is how I got my current job
You should go do that......
I'm not saying they did, but I'm also not saying they are above that
Alright fine, I assume that the L6s are smart enough to be like, that person isn't going to be here don't bother discussing it
You know since they're directly invovled
I heard engineering was included
Yeah, Dave that is just a helpful thing to have in general
Yea, I know. But at this point, it seems I missed out on so many contacts
doesn't matter
make one now
What? Not at all. It's like the most fluid place to get contacts
add all your coworkers
I'd like to live in that world. I live in the one where Donald Trump and Boris Johnson got elected to the highest office in their respective countries
no thats not how calibration went.....
Oh, definitely. But it's a mental block
That's a scary level of cynism drew
DO IT!!!!
Do I need to get you drunk or fight you to help you get over that?
:justdoit:
I don't have one either
:facepalm:
interesting
I was more optimistic pre 11/2016
I cant get any work done....
Do we want to review my 2019? It was kind of hard not to be a scary level of cynic after it
Because you're distracted or worried?
Settle it.

IN SMASH
YES
:same-here:
weeb music helps, but only a small amount
You guys are very distracting to day
:orly:
Only if it gets to be 5v1 with no team attack
SO I CAN MURDER YOU THROUGH DREW!
This is how we play Tragedy Looper
"Murder her, that'll help us find the suspect!"
"Kill them all in the hospital! See who lives and is the time traveler!"
tempted to post via hubot in some channel asking if the rumors of layoffs are true
PLEASE
:mj_popcorn:
i searched. only things i found were recruiting teams sayng 'company X is having a layoffs, we can start recruiting from there'
I mean you guys are silly if you think this is going to be in a public slack
But Dakota has powers
someone asked about it in eng-managers
it got drowned
POWER
REALLY!!?!?!?!
How did get drowned?
Also you should keep bringing it back up
because people started focussing on reviews and got distracted
POWER
No emoji again for deja vu
<@UDC4QL95G>
Oh, or a horrible delay from my post
looksl ike a delay from POWER
I'd probably still win :smile:
Oh, no team attack. That wouldn't work
That's what CJ was saying
What's the mental block? You put up a photo and your latest resume. It basically does the rest
ehh, you can curate it more than that
Wouldn't be very refined, but better than not having one
but yes, better than nothing
You also have to keep your resume updatd
I havn't changed mine since I started working at wayfair
Put up a quick blurb. Refining it takes time, but the main thing for you two would be just putting up Wayfair, role, time
I'm all too aware of having mental blocks on writing resumes and re-writing cover letters
I only do cover letters if required and then generally decide if the job requires one, it probably wouldn't be the right fit anyways
But <@UDC4QL95G>, how old are you?
26
mannnn, I lost
Drew won
I actually thought 24 or 25
Nah i'm going on 4 years at wayfair now
you'd have been right last night, Dave
IMO it's never too soon
I was laughing at the original 9/11 joke with starfox
which one's that?
Is 9/11 still too soon?
hell no
Well I thought he was turning 24 or 25, so currently a year younger
Kind of my thoughts on it too, but I'm also very very very indirectly affected by it, as opposed to other people
No yokes today, only sad nervousness
You pulled a Dakota there Dave
Aysh gave you the technical correct
I did?
You plowed on through
Also, I do think that 9/11 is too soon. I went to the museum and it was really sad. Would recommend anyone going if you're in NYC
Oh, I was clarifying. I don't like to claim false victory :smile:
Totally a non-issue, I think it was just funny
sure it's a tradegy
Is 9/11 the hospital incident?
Threading this because I like this topic:
I don't know about never
you're kidding, right?
I've definitely not been in the mood for jokes n amount of time after the incident in question, but been receptive at y time later
It's a Tragedy Looper reference
oh, :loop:
It's an even that can happen in a game if a character gets paranoid enough that kills everyone in the hospital.

The "good guys" sometimes trigger it because killing people is a valid strategy in that game
I understand that people disagree with me on this, so I tend not to make/share these kinds of jokes
I  dont like today, but Im going to like tomorrow even less.
but you could make the joke same day, and I'd likely still find it funny
Should I wait to implode?
terrible, sure
but it'll still bring a smile to my face
yes. That's my plan as well
well, maybe this is too extreme
I'll be vv distracted at board game night tonight, probs won't stay too late
:hmm:
I guess there is a lag time before it's funny
like once the shock wears off
Different strategies. I use game nights to take my mind off things. Healthier than harddrugs
is that your next highest ranked coping method?
No, it become video games or Youtube pretty closely after game nights
Yeah, and unfortunately I think it takes different amounts of time for people to get to that place
i definitely didnt google what 'hard rug' meant
I like joking around about a lost loved one's life pretty quickly after they've died. Goes straight into remembering the moments you enjoyed about the person's life and celebrating that. Not how some people like to do it
Thought about fixing that typo. Glad I didn't
On a more serious note, it might be worth redistributing the message that this slack exists. If people are worried about layoffs, it'd be nice to know this community exists than suddenly be let go and be missing a part of your support network
Not that I'm getting the impression that anyone in the game group will be directly affected.
Gallows humor tends to be one of my go tos sooooo not the best for this
It's just interesting how intensely personal "Is it too soon?" is.
I mean alcohol doesn't count as a hard drug right?
If it is a group of just me, CJ, and Brenden, then yeah, we'd be saying it's ok to joke about something as early as the next day
Throw Dave in, and it might be months, or decades, depending on the topic
No it doesn't, but it's very far down the list for me
Not for me!
Just ask Mei
That feels slightly insulting to Dave
Dave we love you, we're just assholes I promise
I mean, I don't bother keeping LinkedIn up to date unless I'm job hopping
So it just has that I've been on the CTX since I started
It's still weird that I go from like 1-2 views a month to 1-2 views a day
I keep my current job title up to date
but I don't put details about my current role until I begin looking
I'm purely going on his opinion of the 9/11 thing.
I'm sorry if I'm being insulting. Taking longer to joke about it is not something I'm taking as a negative.
You'd not be alone in that
awwww so wholesome :heart:
I tried alcohol as a coping mechanism once
Never again
1. Good on you for not doing it again
2. I could never really use drugs/alcohol to cope because I find it kinda silly since I still know the original problem exists and it doesn't really help me
Confirmed that it won't be driven by performance.
Howso?
Business priority driven
Layoffs can never be performance based
that's firing
Not officially, but unofficially
And you think that's anything but a party line?
I mean clearly a good chunk is going to be business driven but not all
Unofficially, layoffs are always performance based, you want to keep the high performers and people who can do extra work for little to no extra pay
I mean, from intuition, it's a bit different bc it's like "cut 90% of Wayfair Next" instead of telling managers "find the bottom 10% and cut them"
You'd still keep the high performers, but it's *mostly* not performance based
That's just my intuition though
Layoffs are generally a cost cutting measure, they're probably doing this ahead of the Q4 call because it'll help boost the stock
I doubt it'll boost the stock though... mass layoffs general tank stocks iirc?
They're always business driven, never performance, and yet to dave's point the high performancers are never removed
No mass layoffs boost stocks, cost reduction means greater margins
I'm pretty sure it'd tank the stock bc it shows that wf isn't confident in itself to keep growing at the expected rates
It takes like a year or 2 for the missing workforce to impact ops
They can do both tho, but in this case, we're coasting along on "potential". We already have hugely negative profitability. So saving some costs don't really factor into our stock price
But layoffs are wf saying "we're not actually growing as much as we thought we would and have to cut people". And that looks REALLY bad to me as an investor
If it was a very profitable company already that was trying to save extra money? Yea, that'd probably be good bc it's saying that upper management is able to trim fat and still make money
To me, it looks like how we do advertising. If we cut ads, we could probably break even or make money. But it'd completely tank the stock price since we wouldn't grow nearly as fast, which would make our convertable loans require cash, which would sink the company completely
Dave, as an investor layoffs are not the sign for lack of growth, WF will show that.  Some investors will get excited because it shows that WF is willing to start taking cost cutting measure to get to profitability
Revenue changes lag staffing changes, this means that there's a period of time where we look better.  900 people sounds like a lot, but if Dakota is right it's a drop in the bucket
which makes this much more a cost cutting/investor play, than an actual company directive
Yea, but we're not rolling in profits. Losing 100mm vs losing 120mm doesn't make any difference to investors - all that matters, ESPECIALLY because we're losing money, is if we beat expectations. So layoffs won't help with that
Some might get excited that we're making moves to profitability, but I don't think that any short of drastic layoffs would affect that. And it shows that we're not as convinced we can grow as we were last year, which is what really matters to investors
I actually can't say for sure which one I agree with more. Layoffs of 900 people though is pretty small, and I think most analysts would take the CJ route
900 people lay off in CS related stuff is going to make investors happy because they're going to go "Finally getting rid of costs that don't bring more revenue"
and our growth isn't 0, it's just not 40% YoY anymore
We're still classed as growth at our rate
The time, target, and number all line up with this is to make investors feel better because we're already fixing the problems we had from an abyssal Q4
Was Wayfair Next one of the departments targeted? Or just a random example Dave put out there?
Dakota thinks it's CS Dave put out a random example of Next
It's not on the ops side, I haven't seen anything to indicate that
I just put up a random engineering team that doesn't directly contribute to profits
<https://www.quora.com/How-do-company-layoffs-affect-stock-prices>
I think that's pretty much what I'm saying. If investors view this as "trimming the fat", it's a good thing for stock price. But if they view, as I would, it's a "oh crap, we're not growing as fast as we thought", it won't go so well. I think if this comes out close to the time of bad Q4 earnings...
However, this is typically following moderate layoffs as opposed to grand scale ones. Moderate layoffs are sometimes a strategy for companies to cut back and focus on their earnings potential.
900 people is trimming the fact for a fortune 500 no ifs and or buts
Yea, that's in line with what I was saying. They *can* be good, but it depends on how it's viewed, and what's the reasoning. If the reasoning can be boiled down to "we're not growing as fast as expected" as Brenden first started this, then that's a :bidoof:
In which case, laying off a small portion of the company to better align with costs with growth is :plus_1:
What the investors are gonna see is, "WF growth has slowed down _as expected_ and as we transition into a _profit_ focused company we've started cutting costs"
There will be some grumbles about the lower growth but general encouragement for the "tough" layoffs
That would boost it if we were making a profit though. But we're not - we only have our "potential" and "growth" to buoy us. If growth is so bad that we're cutting staff, that's not a good look
Dave, we have strategic investments aboard that make us negative.  This is all about US profitability.  We're not losing 100M in the US.  Looking at the latest 10-Q for Wayfair for 9 months it's 600M
for Wayfair as a whole
DAMN SON WE IN THE HOLE!
Yea, we're really not doing too well. Even US is negative
Not as bad as abroad, but we're not strictly profitable
iirc
Oh no they are laying people off! Just quit, that wills how them
<@UDC03KCGK> On a scale of :popcorn: to :mj_popcorn: how entertaining is this to watch? :smile:
Redacted. Cant  edit text
That's due to the unprofitablility, not the layoffs
"no" is an awfully bad word to redact today...
Wayfair from when I was working there was always operating on a "Do you want profit? We can give that to you tomorrow. We want growth, so we invest and invest and use the growth to pay old loans to be solvent enough to take new ones."
So yeah, layoffs adjusting for growth is "Whoops, overdid it. Course correct. Ok, back to business as usual."
You're also talking about how "Oh, you didn't grow crazy numbers again? Whatever, you're a Fortune 500 and still beating that mark. Have another dollar!"
Updated the ban
no is now allowed
Ummm, excuse me, I think I know a thing or two more about the stock market than the rest of you plebians. I'm subscribed to r/wallstreetbets
No "Davidette", more than 2 syllabus
Visa is a sucky process. It also cost so much money.
Visa is a sucky process. It also cost so much money.
I mean if you're a wall streetbets guy you're in trouble
welcome and good luck
Huh well that was interesting
:wave:
That was something I set up as a joke a long time ago and it just never triggered till now
WTF!?!?!?
Wellll I'm still going with if Dave is on Wallstreet bets, we have bigger problems
basically, if the ban was ever `cj` then you would be entirely redacted
<@UTX6E7LLU> has priorities - sets up her avatar before saying anything :smile:
I is worryed  :disappointed:
phoebe - if I dont get fired tomorrow, would  you like to join us to the Azores?
LOL
Aysh, you're not getting fired
<@UHQD9J1SL> or <@UDC4QL95G>, give us more inside information so I don't have to be nervous all night
Dave, there's not a ton more information they can give you
I NEEEEED more info
Nothing could possibly go wrong if Dakota read's Niraj's emails. Or does a ctrl+F for "davfreeman"
lol
I mean it's doubtful that names even made it to Niraj's level
It's more you need to cut x number of heads
Hahahahaha
Actually I have to read them programatically, so I would just add a full mailbox query for "davfreeman"
False, Dakota has god powers
I knooooooow, it was a yoke
Not sure what the Azores is but you won’t get fired!!
Soooooo
so
We have an auto-post in my old team's channel that triggers at 4:45, telling people to log time
we have something similar for ticket updates
I sometimes reactemoji to it
So today, I reactemoji'd :nervous:
:uhoh:
what happened?
My ex-manager just DM'd me, saying "why :nervous: emoji today?"
how'd you respond?
:nervous:
&gt; Hey - cause of rumors that are floating around mainly :upside_down_blob:
&gt; What rumors?
&gt; Rumors of "re-organization" and the such
But he responded with
&gt; ah, yeah, lots of rumor talk but i haven’t heard anything real yet
So take that as you will
high up manager is currently talking to my manager and the PM org manager
in a conference room
my manager is usually home by now
Yea, shits hit the fan
Yeah I saw Jomar looking for Andrew a little bit ago
it's giving me a bad feeling
Is it time to :panic2: yet?
I mean dave for you that was a while ago
Or time to peek into Niraj's email?
it's never the time to do that
even if dakota technically can
Also, for me, having over the top reactions to things like this to other people IS my coping mechanism
Even if I'm not _quite_ as nervous as I say
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UDL020K8D> did you guys start walking over to copley yet?
I was gonna stop for some food and then head over. Then got delayed
lol
Let me know when you leave I'll walk with you
BY A MEETING ABOUT FIRING ALL HIS UNDERLINGS :panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2:
I'm almost to Copley t stop
Heading down
uffff
im interestedin this Andrew/ Jomar meeting
then youre coming to the Azores!
At Copley sq
I don't even know who those people are
We're at chipotle
higher up managers in the comp intel org
also kaushal
Like L6?
Jomar is at least L5 probably L6
Kaushal is below Jomar, but either L4 or L5
probably L4
andrew is L4?
Also that scanner guy in Copley is around again
flat tire dude?
L6 i think
Ok, just waiting on you two at Copley to get checked in
Good morning! All major tools and feature toggle access is now on lock down. Brace yourselves.
Ooh maybe this should be added to Prometheus
And thus it begins!
Interesting that they'll lose a whole day of engineering productivity over this
It could be a coincidence and not a factor of news that may or may not happen today
Victoria, freezing engineering access is Layoff/Firing 101 for engineers
Why because a disgruntled engineering can cause MASSIVE damage
Generally for Firing they have someone on stand by who kills access while your in the meeting
But with this many people need to know is too large easier to turn EVERYONE off
It's had it confirmed fr too many sources and saw email communication about it too...
Oh I know that, but from what I've heard in this slack is that no one know who is getting axed. If it's all customer service, then eng lockdown is a coincidence
I would say that Dakota is probably wrong on the fact that this is going to hit mostly CS
Yup, that's gonna set people on edge
I'm definitely on edge
I know tomorrow is a minor holiday, but changes before a holiday are never good for morale
Wishing you all the best and everyone here makes it out without a scratch
Wtf are they afraid that people are gonna range and make breaking deploys?
This is nuts
Yea, I'm pretty sure that's fairly standard
But to do this before Valentine's day... Why not do it next week. Just awful timing
Presidents day is a long weekend for a lot of places too
And yes dakota, less break deploy and more toggle shit that'll bring down the site
It only takes one angry engineer to cause millions of dollars of damages
my QA got laid off
on my team
Supply Chain Analytics has already announced, my analyst just told me
how did you find out?
announced what?....
the layoffs
she got an email
QA is already in dire straits, we need more, not fewer
Well, I mean, I hope it's still "we"
theyve been trying to move QA to automation and QE for a while now
That will always ends well
I have seen better run layoffs personally
I'm not in the office, are there emails or anything?
nothing to 'all'
It's just impacted individulas
panic check email
Wait, you could possibly get an email that says, guess what? You don't work here anymore?
I feel like we should probably turn prometheus off for the day
Why?
bots adding more confusion to what's already going to be a tense day is probably not a good thing
Ah I can see the logic behind that
Silence Chaos Seed
Oh good, was terrified it would be the small chance of "Psych!"
Lol
Can someone check if Rachel is still employed? I'd be interested in seeing if they used this as an excuse to remove "troublemakers"
lastname
oh her
It was helpful being able to collect money while I was looking for a job. I collected for about 3 months. Just don't travel on vacations while collecting unemployement.
still here
Well that's good at least
Yooo, anyone who works there, can you log into my employee account to use my waybucks?
Davfeeeman
uff is that legal
can you log into wayfair .com and buy yourself a gift card?
I never set up a non employee login
justy try with your WF pwd
your first password should work for logging in
I cant change to your name for 'working as'
sign in as him on wayfair, don't work as him
Yea, you wouldn't be able to work as me
dude you got $160 still
Ah, sweet, so you can use it? Can u use the employee discount on my account?
I can't login online, it just says "an error has occurred"
nope. can't use employee discount
Boooo, that's no fun
I assume you can't transfer it to your account?
I can update your email address i think
Can someone ask if they can transfer it? Cause I'd like to do that so someone can use employee dist
Oh, updating email might help...
hmmm question is whether or not I could get in trouble for doing so. You could try calling wayfair and asking them to do it
I'd assume that you could until proven otherwise
But, it's my account... I mean, I'd kinda rather not call wf right now haha. And I doubt anyone would know. I've made screens for customer service, they know nothing if it's not right in front of them
did you have the wayfair app? it might still be signed in
the person we wanted to invite t chaos mnkey has been let go :disappointed:
Text them! we only need their email to invite them
who was it?
So yeah, I'd see what can be done with it
Well, that's unfortunate. But Dakota says he can still access it...
yes, but likely he shouldn't
Well that's shitty
Yea, I don't want to do anything to get him fired :grin:
There is a good chance the SSC's haven't been trained to not change your email address though. If you call in with your recent orders they can likely hook you up
Yes we can still invite them!
Eh, I don't want to do anything sketchy rn
ask her what to do about tracking orders that were in progress.
Not sure if that is in a channel or not
didnt know them personally so dont have contact:confused:
Marissa wilson
wait
was she the #help-no-stupid-questions-but-yes-stupid-answers person?
Yes
What channel is it in? I'll go check it out mys... Owai
does she like board games?
She'd still be in chat history wouldn't she?
it was in #help-no-stupid-questions
They culled a lot of new people
i had a dude start this week
But we have no way to reach her drew
today was his first/second day at his desk
Just saying a lot of chopping block people less than a year of tenure
Was he let go?
nope
which is weird, because his experienced coworker was
maybe it was a salary/immigration thing
Could reach out to Marissa on LinkedIn
this is probably a terrible thing to say, but technically the new hire (white male) makes the team more diverse
Were any of you in any of these meetings being told about efficiency?
nope
Would be honestly shocked if that was a serious consideration. Pay and Visa makes more sense
Anyone have any insight into B2B?
So she had an SMS subscription to wayfair....
So I have her phone number if that's not too creepy
it definitely is
I may have someone I can ask
what would you like to know?
Anything and everything, most targeted towards `Subho Moulik` and `Gaurav Sharma`
While impacted like Dave, I was giving a choice.  I can work for them or I can take my severance.
don't have names for you, but all of design was cut
4 ish people
a few engineers were cut as well
registry got reorged into another group
Oh, CJ, I thought you said you were safe... That sucks too!
wait, CJ
what
Technically I never answered as to my status.  I am really bummed about you Dave
I didn't realize this
Holy hell man!
And I didn't want to say anything given that I have a choice
what was your choice and did you take severance or new team?
I have till Tuesday at 10am to make it
I met with them this afternoon
what are your choices?
:phew-2:
Join B2B or be laid off
ok, its better than you have a choice!
Figured :lol:
Brian Kiernan will know a lot of people to talk to in B2B
He works on SCA and used to work in Ops Finance with me specifically with B2B and warehousing
But now might be a decent time to look for opportunities closer to your apartment? I don't know what you're looking for though. I mean, heck man, I'm not sure if your situation or mine sucks more. Cause you get a choice, but now have to work for a few days not knowing what you're gonna do
what do you do tomorrow and monday? :what-t:
Yeah, linkedin would be much more acceptable
Talk to people, learn b2b?
In the wake of all of this Sam would like to host everyone for dinner. Whatever night makes the most sense for people. Figured it's a good way to give everyone a night off from worrying about cooking and everything that has happened.
Thanks Drew, really appreciate that! I don't think I want to do anything tonight and tomorrow is V day, but maybe this weekend or Monday?
I think I added everyone on my LinkedIn that I just created, but if I didn't, please add me!
Couldn't find Drew
Yeah, Monday would make the most sense at the moment. Probably around 7:30 so I have time to get cut from my shift.
You looked up Drew didn't you?
Think I found you
Also found you <@UDBGH9BMX>
I looked up Drew and Andrew Carleton, but maybe I just missed you
Maybe the fact I've got the W in my name. Weird
On the drinks side of thing, I'm working at Time Out from 4-9pm tonight. So if you want a drink (alcoholic or otherwise) afterwards, no one is paying for one
I think Monday could work for dinner
Wait, why is this different than wayfair just moving you to a different team like it tends to do?
Or am I missing something
does your pay change?
Dave, LinkedIn won't allow me to connect with you, but my profile is Victoria Kripinski, I can reach out to my recruiter contacts and out them in touch with you
incoming
Might be as an analyst instead of manager
Guess I'm clocking in 15 minutes early
sorry
not that
Mr. Pradyut is probably incoming
:oh-no-black:
That posted out of order
Was supposed to post before you posted about Prady
I don't think I'm gonna make the trek out there tonight, but maybe next week?
welcome!
Hey praddy!
That's 3 in 3 days
Ah makes sense. It is a whole new position, not the same postiion on a new team?
From what I heard, B2B has lower pay scales
hi friends
So many new friends 🥰
Okay, I really should divorce myself from slack/my email for a few hrs and play something/relax instead of going manic on responding to job things
Hi Prady!
I have an STO meeting in 15 minutes that has an anonymous question board. Any questions you would like asked?
long time no see.
Who will be taking accountability for over hiring or going after things that don't provide as much business value
No it's a lateral and I'm kept whole
So it's just a question of will I want to murder someone in the month of march before I go out on paternity leave
Or do I want to not have a job and take the severance
paternity leave sounds great
Given the severance I got very likely I will transition over the only red flag I saw was the level of newness. Other than that pretty good answers
:clap: dave :clap:
There's also no reason why you can't be the person who takes the move, takes the leave, and if you find a new position during leave, give 2 weeks when you get back
just got a linkedin connection request
It's 2020, the year of You
Dave hasn't found me yet
oh yes. all the buzzwords.
one suggestion: find a different profile pic
you look like either you're judging whatever you're looking at, or weirded out by whatever you're looking at
Very likely what will happen, no way will I say that out loud here
<@UETS9HTSS> when are you planning on heading over?
soon:tm:
want to head over together?
yea
when do you want to leave?
should I grab a few games at my apartment?
there's always :terraform: :mars:
Lol
Nah
We can go now
I'll meet you at your place?
I'm over at the smaller bar
the last one I saw you at?
damn
okay
Okay to me?\
sure
Ok I'm taking off now
Hopping into the elevator
<@UETS9HTSS> here 402 right?
I think my profile picture is great, your opinion wasn't requested
I think the fact my last name isn't in slack is why he hasn't found me not the beautiful profile pic
I don't think I have anyone's LinkedIn here
Same
Waybucks!
I searched for Dakota and found nothing
That's cuz I'm not on LinkedIn
<@UDC4QL95G> you should join us
But why Dakota? It's great, very useful to find people and jobs
I wasn't on it till 2 hrs ago...
Did you search for a CJ OKeefe
I did, can't find you
Whoops its Christopher O'Keefe
CJ O'Keefe apparently is a "Renaissance Man"
I have no plans to find a new job ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
????
I was struggle when to use my formal name
Different CJ, look him up on LinkedIn, his profile says Renaissance man.
Sure. I'm in a meeting at the moment
It's for future networking and such. Who knows when the dream job just walks right by you
Ugh u already came home!
I don't think there is any job that could pop up and make me want to leave my job now.
Haha, I saw that too Victoria
Then it's about helping other friends and colleagues find their perfect job. It's all about the community
Did people get locked out of the building this morning?
I believe they were being told by managers in the office. They would have had to collect their stuff
I think people got emails after they Arrived at worm
I figured it came up in my office and I didn't think that sounded right
Well you're always welcome to join us another night
Yes rarely will they lock you out day of
Happened about 10am
I know marissa!! I knit with her every week!
She was one of the first people I checked on and I was so sad when I found out
lol at the number of software engineer recruiters reaching out to my inbox today
The topic of board games hasn’t come up in our conversations but I was planning on reaching out to her soon and could ask her if she’s interested in joining
You should, we wanted her for the chaos too
Omg yes same
No one loves me :(
What why huh we all do what would we do without you
Oh. Recruiters.
CJ why can't I find your linkedin?
Thanks for coming by guys! Hope you all had fun
Getting real messed up on diet coke, Shirley Temple's, and a ginger ale (not even a ginger beer)
Dunno, I found you
lol
<@UDD45P5A9>, can I have that list too? <mailto:mzlee125@gmail.com|mzlee125@gmail.com>
<@UDBGH9BMX>, I can help with resume if you want :slightly_smiling_face:
Morning.
<@UDC4QL95G> famous but not naked
<@UETS9HTSS> careful what you ask the bartender for
<@UDDE5960N> easiest bar guest ever...after being reminded outside food is never allowed in just about any establishment that serves food. 
<@UK7V13DS7> I don't blame you, the pizza there isn't worth the price, and I get it for free
Doug, bot patrol
<@UDBGH9BMX> suddenly aware of how many and how much people care about him
<@UTX6E7LLU> we do this, it's a thing, it's harder to opt out of than the bots, but you can avoid the ping if you ask (see Doug)
<@UTFFJEJ6P> read above
<@UDTR9SLN4> we actually didn't hear from her yesterday
<@UPGVCMGD9> we didn't see her yesterday (but saw her the day before so I can presume she's fine)
<@UDD45P5A9> girl's got spreadsheets for days
<@UHQD9J1SL> this is by far the farthest down the morning post she's ever been
<@UE2D3HCBW> wave or something or this is the last one!
<@UJTEHPEPL> we miss you, we hope you come back some day
<@UEA7LHFQS> he never embraced the monkeys
<@UDKJNRKHA> hello?
<@UDBV9N1E0> it says he's active! Say something buddy!
<@UDC03KCGK> good morning!
Does Tuesday work for dinner?
What is this for?
Good morning
Dakota and Dave both were having a hard time waking up. Long conversation later, and it actually was deemed useful for Dakota to wake up. Dave more got dragged into it because he wakes up so late and snoozes so many alarms. CJ and I are both morning people and take turns waking the group. 

Then the group got bigger and we being chaos monkeys just kept including people. It's probably the most wholesome thing this channel does.
Sure thing
I want friends
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/mei-lee/>
<@UTZJEALPP> you joined! Happy to see you buddy!
All the friends!!
I like it! I’m usually heading in to work at this time anyway so it doesn’t bother me
Yeah, earliest it ever is is at 7:30. That's a strict rule
Nope dead
Good morning :sun_with_face:
Also I legitimately have to look up more cocktails now. Went through all the tester ones I had flagged in my book. Otherwise the next time Brenden shows up, I'm not going to have anything for him to try.
He'll...have to try what's actually on the menu :shock_poro_explosion:
I appreciate you use this as an opportunity to ping me back :)
Laaaaammme nothing on menu
Unless you make the whole cocktail menu then yes
You should try vodka with grenadine that's a good drink hehehehe
<@UDC03KCGK> Good morning! I am finally active again!
Even if I have a bar of my own, I don't want an entire menu of "specialty cocktails." 3/4 of the menu will be classics or rediscovered drinks from books and what not
IT LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Woot! Happy day! We just got Dakota Fury of Dracula, so we'll be planning one of those game nights in the future (I'd say near future, but there's still a ton we haven't played since Christmas)
I liked Fury of Dracula
It's just called a dirty shirley
One of the better games, that and the Letters from White Chapel
I had someone at the bar who was in their late 20's trying to get a girl to try a whiskey ginger...and got a gin and tonic for himself. And talked them up as his favorite 2 drinks. 
Part of my soul died from that comment.
LOL
What do you mean you didn't hear from me yesterday?
Ohh, that was a good game too!
Just shared the wayoffs list with Amwell's recruiting manager
I hate all the euphamisms management uses to avoid having to say that we had layoffs. Like they don't want to admit it happened
work with <@UDL020K8D> he is really good at making menus
at least the dude knows what he wants
"The activities of yesterday"
"The situation the company is in now"
I want activism to argue my case now :joy:
I turned the rest of the bots back on
cant be easy to talk about but avoidance seems wrong
<@UDBGH9BMX> I can transfer your Waybucks to another account if you want
Was it always a dash in the name? I thought it was an underscore
Mandelaaaa
Ok how is it ok to bring snakes into an office?
People get all up in arms if someone microwaves fish but you can bring snakes. Into. An office?
dead or alive snake?
Yeah, corporate speak fucking sucks. 
"Look, we fired people, mostly because we hired too many in the first place. This sucks for a lot of people, but hopefully this ends up working out better for the rest of you who stayed on."
Alive
Is it a ball python?
Reptiles and snackes
I suspect they aren't dangerous or venomous but they are snakes
Fish in a microwave is bio terrorism. Bringing in a snake is just someone who is protesting bringing a dog into the office being any better
Dan Rowe (a high-up engineer here) works with a reptile shelter or something like that. When I was working with him at labs, I saw him get a bunch of reptiles mailed to the office
Personally I'd like to bring in a rescued Macaw
Dan's an out there dude, but I respect his passion toward what he loves.
I personally ok as long as they aren't within a foot of me. But I don't think it's appropriate.
Birds are just small dinosaurs.
What if I bring a box of cockroaches. Is that cool?
no
no
no
no
no
Those are pests
Tarantula I would be ok with
Exactly my sentiments
Not appropriate no matter how much you love them or skilled you are
Workplace services thing people should not allow this
Someone get me a pitchfork
Yup, I'm just an idiot. Sorry <@UDTR9SLN4>!
Well, in all seriousness, does anyone keep a pet cockroach?
And even in the corner cases that do, snakes and reptiles are still high up on the common pets list. Hell, I'd argue there's more snake owners than say Chinchillas. Turtles and lizards pretty common too. 
Tarantulas are uncommon, but certainly not super rare. 
Cockroaches...I mean, possible, but you'd be one in a million, if that.
Like, hell, I'm more ok with someone bringing in reptiles than cats. Plenty of people are allergic to cats or dogs. Very few if any have allergic reactions to snakes.
I have cat and dog allergies.
Also my brother was bit by a dog on a leash bro g walked. I do not trust them. 
Biologically we are more inclined to fear things that can actually kill us, as opposed to cockroaches that are just weird and dirty.
Someone else having them as pets doesn't matter. I know personally people who raise cows and treat them like pets, doesn't mean others would stop eating them.
lol <@UDDE5960N> I think you dropped a couple of pixels when uploading your linkedin profile pic
it has lots of JPEG
that's full size, not thumbnail
I'm just saying the cockroach argument is just sensationalist. I'm not sure it qualifies as a straw man, but it doesn't help further the conversation.
You can be legitimately afraid of them, but people fear spiders too. They fear dogs. Cats will scratch people (and declawing them is to me inhumane). 
Plus, if there's anyone who I would trust with those animals, it's the guy who works at a shelter for them. He probably has actual permits for those things.
I have a faint scar on my face from a cat
It doesn't further the conversation because you can't find an argument against it! :stuck_out_tongue:
I've put out several against it
Don't make me lock it!
You lose a single roach and you have start an infestation over multiple blocks that you may never fully undo. No other animal listed can do that. 
WE KEEP THE UNDERSCORE!
CJ named it originally
What if I'm trained to take care of roaches???
there's quite fun context around this gif
he read the script wrong, and yelled disappointed instead of acting disappointed
:joy::joy::joy::joy::joy:
They are still one of the three animals that can cause civilization level damage to humanity. 
Fine. I'll bring my pet tiger in then
Much better
Point is , this is an office environment and no matter how chill you are with something, everyone should be considered.
Honest question, what is the policy on animals in the office?
What if I'm a professional clown. Can I dress up as one and walk through the desks?
Like can you host a day where you bring in a box of puppies?
BEST DAY EVAAAAAAA
And are babies included in the animal policy?
I've seen it done outside the office campus...like lobby
Doug :face_with_raised_eyebrow:
I'm a baby how dare you :joy:
There was a petting zoo in Boylston once. 
Also those animals were tranqued out of their minds
The odds of you throwing up on me have proven to be quite low. 
What, and they only had one take?
In a separate space, not the actual office
.......
True. 
Invalid argument. Strike through required
I worked in an office with an office dog once. It was awful. 
Seriously, what is the policy on animals in the office?
/roll d20+2
Clearly none of us know. 
MOTHER FUCKER!
Don't think there is one. Probably because no one in their right minds would get their pets delivered
Because I understand you trying to consider everyone, but that should mean you treat dogs and cats the same way.
I know someone has a service dog in the office everyday
Fix that typo
I think we should. I'm also slightly uncomfortable around dogs
You got mentioned on the podcast instead. Live in infamy, shame, and way too many twitter messages from people you don't know
Service animals are a different category. (Should be)
We could.... improve them if you want
I don't think this wasn't actually put in the show/movie
Wasn't there a news article about some lady claiming her bird or snake was a service animal to get it on a plane and people were making fun?
more of a blooper
Having one in my office was bad. It was always high stress when it walked over, I would just wait for it to wander elsewhere. 
or maybe they did? I've never watched it
Best blooper!
Therapy dogs are terrifiying because they have minimal testing
This was before I had a job, so I put up with random shit for temp-ing 
Therapy peacock was claimed on a plane once. 
Service dog and therapy dog are two separate categories.
<@UDDE5960N> true therapy dogs get a ton of training. 
Like, you need an actual service animal because you're blind, etc. Totally different.
But lots of people can get them approved with minimal effort
Like a trained dog can recognize panic attacks and actually help pull people out of them. 
That's a problem with laws
There was the "certified" therapy dog that attacked people on a plane
Yeah, that’s abuse of the system. 
I don't disagree, but I know service dog requirements are more rigorous than therapy dog.
So yeah, no pets or all the pets. I'd even make an argument for hypo allergenic pets.
No pets sound good. 
(Children under 2 count)
You raise cockroaches? Unless it is strictly in a lab for science: shot on sight
The issue is "emotional support" animals, they can get an online certificate. Therapy and Service have rigorous training and proper certifications
Which I think laws should be stricter on
Make it an embarrassing large fine to break this law
Oh def, I don't think emotional support animals should be a thing, it's called having a pet
I know someone who got the certificate because they're building didn't allow pets and wanted to skirt it. Yes the laws should be stricter
No pets unless service animal is acceptable.
I had a family member do that. 
We have a girl who joined our team last summer with a therapy dog and I can’t tell you how frustrating it is watching her actively untrain that dog. It’s gotten to the point where if it sees someone it likes it will run to them from across the tower and she has no control over it
woah. thats...not... how its supposed to work
No... 
&gt; From 11-2 I'll have a bunch of Reptiles on the 7th floor near the old reception desk. Swing by and hold a tortoise or snake, etc.. Figured it was a good day for some Reptile therapy :slightly_smiling_face:
so, maybe take that into consideration if you're wandering around 7 today.
isn't that how this conversation started?
idk, I just saw Aysh mention snakes.
I'm saying specifically where the snakes are
I have a town hall about yesterday just behind that place at 11:joy: I'm sure I can walk through it just fine. But I find in inconsiderate
wait where is the reception desk now?
skylobby
lol
that list length reflects the mood yesterday
who brought snakes? Is this for a presentation?
Better than his facebook pic, I only got to see a pic of a guy in a hockey mask before I went on the date
mouse
tiger!
<@UDL020K8D> you didn't like the dog?
I do not like dogs. dogs that walk around with no single person nearby responsible for it or controlling it, no, I do not like.
We hadn't mentioned mice yet, but yeah, they can do that. Rats specifically are another of the three animals capable of civilization-level damage to humanity.
gotacha
Not funny.
I'm still confuse. Who brought snake to the office? What kind? How many?
The giga moji does
Regarding immigration assistance for those laid off, apparently they were offered an option to stay on the payroll to get their severance pay instead of a bulk sum. This will reduce their days of unemployment and delay potentially losing their visa status. It's a big deal and a great relief, having been in that place before.
Oh the snakes have been sent back since they aren't allowed in the building
That is nice to see they are trying to make it better for them
That is nice. Not a lot of companies would do that.
Thank god. Snakes are scary.
Yea!!!!
Not suprised
<@UDBGH9BMX> I miss you!
Speaking of, is there a preference next week between Wednesday and Thursday for dinner? Monday just puts a lot of pressure on Sam since I don't have a definite end time for work that day
I cannot do Thursday, as I'll be in Seattle
I could probably do Wednesday evening, though I'll need to be packed well before then
I think either day works for <@UK7V13DS7> and I, but i'll defer to her judgment
Boylston had milk and cookies in the lobby
I cannot do either. enjoy dinner
better than snakes
yup
yes, let's encourage stress eating
i mena- im all for eliminating  snack wall stuff and giving us money instead
Fill the snack bins with dollar bills
the snacks are never gonna go away though
milk and cookies is not a WF thing, its a service the building is offering
we get them because we're tenants
oh
Yea our building likes us
I'm sad no more random building events for me
im sure there will be things that beat said random building events for you
Like what where's the free cookies aysh?!?!?!
The new team is in Copley?
you can but a 80 pack of cookies on amazon for $12
That's not as good as random free cookies
But you can’t buy a direct tunnel to the orange line. Big point to Copley. 
True
Yea
are you tryin to do a Copley vs Boylston thing CJ?
<@UDDE5960N> Wednesday works better for me :slightly_smiling_face:
But Boylston means CJ have to walk more. He needs it.
but he cannot handle the sun
Sorry if I missed pings, I'm pretty sure I missed a few. I just tried to catch up on my phone (cause I don't have desktop slack anymore), but I've been forceably divorcing myself from my phone today
Oh, could you? How would you do that and that would be fantastic, thanks! I want to make sure that you don't get in trouble though. Could you xfer then to Dakota or someone who still works there so I could get the employee discount?
Thanks Mei! Drew mentioned that you and Sam are good at that, so I'll send it over when I update it
We will get him sunscreen
we should all do a phone divorce day every now and then
<@UTX6E7LLU>
we are thinking march/ april- 4+ days (2-3 days off + weekend)
I pinged you just to make sure you have an outlet if you need it
Why? is his phone low on charge?
No. To talk aysh.
Hehehe. Yes meeee talk to meeee
I was fired before Wayfair with not even one days pay as severance!
Looks like I'm going on random workouts with you <@UDDE5960N> 
You like Tennis at all?
Sure I'll do tennis
I'm terrible at it
Damn son, how did that happen?
My loud mouth
Wasn't the best experience so have selective amnesia
Lol, poor aysh
Is there anywhere near the office?
I’d definitely consider it, I was thinking I’d like to do something in March anyways, what’s the approximate cost?
Our guess is around 300 each direction to fly, like 35 a night for lodging. 
We’re talking off season so the weather might be less than 100% perfect, but we should be keeping costs down. 
Capping at ~1200 I think? That's my hope
I want to go!!!! But our budget would be low
Yea I would abandon baby and go on trips 
The Boston commons
Sounds good :) I been recruiting and interviewing a lot of all the companies that I worked for so my skills for it is pretty good
Ginger beer is tasty 
WTF?!?!?
Sent the list of companies, let me know if you didn't get it
@Brenden Bourdeau you still want saucy bread???
? <@UDDE5960N> was that supposed to be a ping? It really looks like it was, but doesn’t seem to be. 
^ <@UETS9HTSS> <@UDDE5960N> wants to feed you.
Fixed it
/roll 1d20
Yea! <@UPGVCMGD9> is the best
For Tuesday!
Only a half tray though
Ok
You can Venmo me :) I messaged you the cost
My understanding is that most people don't have today off. 
So good morning!
<@UDBGH9BMX> hunt the jobs with spears and arrows
<@UDL020K8D> let out your inner child with a Paper Plane
<@UHQD9J1SL> the planning for the Azores must resume
<@UPGVCMGD9> peer reviews Tarrasques like a boss
<@UTZJEALPP> late to the party
<@UTX6E7LLU> technically on time
<@UTFFJEJ6P> making the French evil
<@UDDE5960N> deliverer of saucy bread
<@UK7V13DS7> saucy bread co-financer
<@UETS9HTSS> saucy bread sucker
<@UDD45P5A9> envoy of spreadsheets
<@UDTR9SLN4> protesting emoji creation
<@UDBV9N1E0> confirmed alive!
go back to sleep drew
Saucy bread is incoming now!
Dude, what’s the one thing I keep asking you for?
Hilarity?
To stop pinging me on wake up messages. 
Sorry, that one just slipped my mind today. Normally I don't forget
I don't have today off either! I just have to be at work around 12
I like the new version
Where it fails to pretend to be me?
No where the short sentences get scrambled but the longer ones don't
I think it is impossible for messages over a certain length to get scrambled.
Exactly so word length factoring in is perfect
Because the 15 divided by any number over 15 is a decimal, and I don't get the impression the roll mechanic triggers for decimals
It can do decimals. 
It fact it can only do decimals. 
The odds given must be between 0 and 1. 
Just really really low odds, I'm thinking I should do exponential or higher than linear
15% divided by 20 is 0.75%
So it quickly gets very small. 
are you not awake yet?
<@UDL020K8D> then you must not be on summon the silent then
That is true. 
bu he didnt ping you?
this is how you  ping people, right? <@UDC03KCGK>
<@UHQD9J1SL> is right, unless Drew edited it
He edited it. 
it does say its edited, but whats the point of editing after the fact? <@UDC03KCGK>
You woke Sam up on that ping. Feel better?
A token gesture after an apology
...............sorry Sam :sheepish:
She'll be fine, she was just sleeping in since she's one of the few getting the day off
The ping wars have begun again <@UDC03KCGK> and you started it <@UDC03KCGK>!
I'm not sure <@UDC03KCGK> will like what he's started
I barely noticed the first time the ping wars began
Also me starting it has to have been as accidental as possible.
Not the first war started by accident. 
Is anyone else going to PAX?
I'm sleep deprived, yet somehow super productive this morning
its the adrenaline
is it?
clearly the only reason you'd be sleep deprived is that you were being chased by a lion (evolutionarily speaking)
so your body is keeping you pumped, to fight other lions.
:lion:
Ummmmmmm
I require a spear some fine mesh metal armor please
<@UETS9HTSS> Venmo me $$ :slightly_smiling_face: saucy bread hehehe
Are you working yet!?!?!?!?!
will that help? im sure a lion can rip your limbs off through the armor
Nahhhh, at that point it's all bludgeoning damage
So it's all about survinging the broken bones
:resolved:
Don't have tickets. When is it?
Next Thursday-Sunday
I have tickets for Thursday/Friday
Shocker is everything but Saturday is still available
Even the 4 day passes
Huh, I could go on Friday
The center is open from like 10am-10pm
yea $$ thanks!!
Ohhh <@UETS9HTSS> You do know that Saucy bread is in Boston right?
I was thinking of doing Thurs/Fri, not sure tho
Well if you come, I'll be there.  Thurs is my favorite day for doing stuff on the floor.  Friday isn't bad, but is a nice day to go to the talks
Saturday is great for gawking at Cosplays, and Sunday is fun for deals (Thursday too for some reason)
excuse me?
can I please have a link
No I meant I already brought it up
I'm still your dealer, it's just here
:disappointed:
:he-bring-you-mixed-feelings:
alright, when do you leave for the day usually?
Don't ask me why it's an RI only thing
Today I'll be leaving 4:25ish, if you want I can bring it over
The trains are on a Saturday schedule so my commute is all fucked up
that would be awesome; I can definitely meet you somewhere
bad chaos seed! :shame:
Sure meet in Copley/Back bay somewhere in there is fine for me
Bostonians don’t eat saucy bread 
Sounds good
Can I meet you by sweetgreen?
They would if you could find it in boston
That's fine with me, I'll ping you when I head out
Soooo now all we need to do is find a baker in boston and start our own company
Said the guy who don’t cook
Hence why we need to find a baker
not sweetgreen
<@UDDE5960N> I meant tendergreens
damn green named places :shakes_fist:
Also find a butcher and a candle stick maker
and send them out to sea
Tendergreens is fine, I was just gonna wander aimlessly through Copley
Hello! Is this happening also,o where do you live :see_no_evil:
Hey <@UDBGH9BMX> Do you have any interest in Analytics?
awaiting your ping
Probably gonna leave in like 2 minutes
cool, I'll head down in a minute
It's gonna take me like 10ish mins to get there
<@UETS9HTSS> Heading over now I'll let you know when I'm there
Downstairs by tendergreen
You are far too excited I haven't even left my building
its a quiet day
Yes, it is
I think I like software engineering, thank tho!
I just really want to go to the super giant concert on Friday haha
<@UTFFJEJ6P> did you see this?
oh I just aw it yeah I can do that. What's your old account's address and how much money did you have on it?
Ohhhh why?
Well one of my old PM's just got laid off. I guess the streak isn't over
Wait what????
uff- perfromance?
We think so. He somehow has already accepted a job offer so it almost has to be
At a different company?
Uber
Ohhhh ok
~6 people laid off today
also uber had 2 rounds of layoffs last year :stuck_out_tongue:
laid offs still going?
When Dakota said uber, I thought of just as a driver hahaha
dont think so- this seems to be one off performance related stuff
Mei understands
laid off or let go?
big difference
Yea I'm with brenden
That was the first question in my head but totally forgot to ask
He said laid off. I just pass on the info
I don't where it was posted, but yes, Wednesday night is still the plan for the dinner, unless <@UDBGH9BMX> can't make it, in which case it feels a little weird to have the dinner without him. 
Where we live is 125 Chiswick Road, apt 213, Brighton, MA
02135 if Google really needs the zipcode for some reason
Sounds good to me! What time?
I love their music
Davfeeeman, had like 160 I think?
Good morning Normal monkies!
Summon the Silent
Why are we normal today? :upside_down_face:
What is normal?
It's the people who signed up for mayhem and chaos, everyone else is an observer
what time?
I won't be there :slightly_smiling_face: I like the munchkin game area though.
But..I'm not normal, never have been, never want to be
Which is why you're normal here!
I got it, thanks! Gonna take a look at it today
Time for tomorrow is 6:30
Well, a sister team wanted to do a load test last night for ingesting emails. They told me 20k

350k emails SENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS later the ingestion process if off and incoming cusotmer emails are sketchy at best
That’s awesome 
well..... that's fun
my favorite part of that is they're off by a factor of almost x^2
I mean only another 50k emails and they would have been there
*GUFFAW!*
I like how the incoming customer emails are
&gt; sketchy at best
6:30
6:30
That's a cruel deja vu
Best part is we only process 7000 per hour, so....
:saved:
sketchy is in "who knows if we are actually gonna receive the email" maybe that customer will never hear back from wayfair
So sketchy that we'll send customer emails, do we have a record of who was hit and who wasn't?
Wind!
I mean that's just 50 hours
Sooo like by tomorrow it'll be done!
Earth!
Heart!(?)
Fire!
Water!
......
GO PLANET!
Captain Planet, he's our hero,
Gonna take pollution down to zero
why cant it be a wed evening cartoons party
Theme and time
Ok, so when we throw a Saturday Morning Cartoons party finally, guess we'll have to put an episode of Captain Planet on
:saved:
I mean that's just 50 hours
So sketchy that we'll send customer emails, do we have a record of who was hit and who wasn't?
Sooo like by tomorrow it'll be done!

Water!
Really no Fire!
Fire!

GO PLANET!
Captain Planet, he's our hero,
Gonna take pollution down to zero
somehow its down to 20k
We broke prometheus today apparently
influx metrics could be misleading. Idunno
somehow its down to 20k
Soooooo lots of things are broken, that's what I'm getting out of this convo
/roll 1d20
Sweet, now I have 2 cigarettes in my inventory!
yeah pretty much. they almost flooded our systems
Everything is broken!
same with kibana
influx had some serious issues yesterday
same with me
what?who said that?
Bum a cigarette does not traditionally imply you add it to your inventory. 
yeah a bummed cig doesn't ever make it to the inventory
you smoke it then and there
I will be there friday wandering around with friends
Confirmed alive on the day I have off X_X
:dude: :woah-dude: :thedude: :chillindude:
Haha, what was it?
`Wait, what team are you on now`
Something about in the past me worrying about getting fired?
Oh, hahaha, that's great
TEAM PLANET!
Let him have fun adding random crap to his inventory
Hey, what are the rules for inviting ppl to this slack? I have 2 good friends from wf who want to stay in contact  - would it be okay to invite them, or is it only allowed for ppl the group knows?
I think drew technically "owns" the slack. I have no qualms about inviting them ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Give me the emails the chaos god will add them!
do they like games?
Wait, can't anyone invite? And yea, they like games
probably. I think this is a public gorup
we're admins cj
I mean do you have the invite button, because I do
so that doesn't necessarily mean everyone has it
I already told him I'd do it, but then Dave was all like "Can anyone do this?" and the answer is I don't know!
Well that's why I was asking!
Ah, I was looking for a link and didn't see one
I mean do you have the invite button, because I do
we're admins cj

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE DAVE?!?!? THEY SAY NOTHING!!!!
:welcome:
:sigh:  another name taht starts with `D`
<@UTSKPJAJE> <@UTSKN5GGJ> say somethinggggggg
Soooo many D's so little time
Well, he's the reason that I'm Dave and not David. Cause he joined the team 1 day before I did, so he got to keep the David name
Wait!?!?!?
YOU WANT TO BE CALLED DAVID?!!?!?
No, but I always had been. Except in college, but that was mainly "Freeman". I'm finally used to being Dave tho by now
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE DAVE?!?!? THEY SAY NOTHING!!!!
:welcome:
I am not a formal person, and david is just too long
Thus I know knight as Dave of :chaos:
:sigh:  another name taht starts with `D`
should I call 911?
CJ are you having a stroke?
blink once for yes
blink no in morse code for no
Don't strokes mess with eye control?
CJ, are you smelling toast? That could be your brain frying and not bread
Wait CJ when are you moving to copley?
I DON"T KNOW!!!!!
Therefore we need to retcon this shit!
Which requires dave giving up his freewill, and that is a price I'm willing to pay!
I'm also willing to let drew give up his freewill, but that'll cost you more
I'm confused
:kermit:
CJ, are you smelling toast? That could be your brain frying and not bread
Your mistake was expecting CJ to make sense
I DON"T KNOW!!!!!
That's ok Dave
No, I'm just removing all of Dave's freewill and supplanting with my own
That's a really cringy gif
Also dave going by david is news to me
She looks so uncomfortable
I would agree with this
So to summarize:
Dave is generally called David
CJ and Dakota did not realize this before today
CJ is not ok with this
CJ without Dave's permission has knighted him Dave of Chaos (Therefore cementing that Dave is Dave and cannot be known by another name retconning that Dave was ever called David)
Scene ends, with Dave being called Dave
I'm also willing to let drew give up his freewill, but that'll cost you more
hold on- do you know Community??????
I'm confused
:kermit:
But if Dave is Dave, then what do we call David
Your mistake was expecting CJ to make sense
That's ok Dave
That's a really cringy gif
This new David?
Clearly he will forever be known as David
She looks so uncomfortable
I would agree with this
:uhoh: I  just realized the pop-up career fair is tomorrow at 5pm... 
But at the same time, I have 300+ emails from recruiters so I'm not sure if I really need to go to the fair, but I don't want to miss Drew's dinner. That was my bad for not realizing they were on the same day haha
Pop up carerr fair is most-def important
But if Dave is Dave, then what do we call David
This new David?
Clearly he will forever be known as David
........ no his title is 'new David'
NuDavid?
Bude Dave is New David
NO THATS WHAT WE JUST WENT THROUGH TO AVOID THIS!
Dave&lt;&gt;David Dave==Dave
I think Prometheus is having a seizure
yeah something is up
career fairs are good to talk to people that know about the role so you can get a better idea if you'd enjoy that job role
<@UDC03KCGK> Sorry bout this, I hadn't realized it's tomorrow.
Its in Copley, which is kinda funny. But not too far from Drew's
That's like 40 mins from drews!
That's ok, come when you can! Glad you have a career fair to go to
Yea career fair!!
Did you update your resume?
You have 300+ emails from recruiters? Nice!
ENOUGH!
Of?
:mj_popcorn:
I feel like I'm missing a lot of context right now
Same
i was randomly yelling- but you may add meaning as you please
:awkward:
also, <@UETS9HTSS> 'arguing' on nonwork-bos
yep
tl;dr
question submission for Q1 meeting requires approval
people are posing aggressive questions to vent anger/fear
I'm saying people should ask questions whose answers will actually matter, not "Do you feel guilty?"
Im on your side
ranting and raging only takes away from precious time and attention that could be devoted to getting actual answers
Who remembers the movie flubber?
I shut  them up! I shut up the people who were arguing! I did it!
What did you say?
The important question: do we all get paid more since we are clearly the valuable ones left?
By sending them this : <https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/02/14/tech-job-cuts-totaling-1100-jolt-silicon-valley-east-bay/>
it was but temporary
People at Wayfair have always felt a little spoiled to me.  But those might be just the loudest voices in a room
Interesting opinion considering the finance teams have openly admitted at pod outings that "Yeah, we definitely under pay our people."
ok im gonna be honest- i agree that other companies pay more- several also pay SIGNIFICANTLY less- but whats preventing me from moving to a higher paying company?
Also depends on how you define pay.  Wayfair is very heavy equity and lighter on cash
we aren't underpaying  (on tech jobs) by ANY means because otherwise visas wouldnt be granted (There is a check to make sure companies dont just hire 'cheap' employees from elsewhere)
I would say that Wayfair makes sure it sits firmly in market average
But I was more so going with the `DO YOU FEEL GUILTY????` sentiment.
If they do feel guilty this makes it worse, if they don't feel guilty they don't care
its a waste of time question.
also- why wouldnt ANYONE keep employees indefinitely and pay them all 500k if they could? its not like they did these layoffs because they were bored and  wanted entertainment. The board apparently told them to. I understand the accountability question, but even if someone took responsibility and stepped down, the layoffs cannot be erased
Hey Aysh
Did you know there was a study and the question was simple.

All other things being equal, would you rather make 100K and everyone else make 200K or 50K and everyone else make 25K?

I'll tell you the response after you answer the question.

I'll tell you the response after you answer the question.
This was all inclusive
in the world?
in the company?
what's the scope here?
so its either -you make more but everyone makes EVEN more
Or you make less and everyon makes even less?
if the scope is world, then the answer should be take the 50k
if it's within the company, take the 100k
id go for making more.
But also, im assuming this isnt a dead end situation and i have itwithing my control to change those cirsumstances too
very smart Brenten
Scope is whole world, such that you won't get price inflation (hence the holding all things equal)
that's impossible
if there's universal basic income of 25k
it becomes the new norm
So basically, do you want twice the standard of living with everyone else standard of living higher than you, or do you want half the standard of living with everyone's standard of living below you
so 50k becomes rich
ok, ignore the specifics, CJ is just asking, are you happier getting more if it puts you behind other people?
is comfort absolute or relative?
Also I finally realized why people were so quite in activism and politics it's because they've been losing their minds in bos
Would you rather be a lord in 1200s or where you are today? Has a similar bend to it
where I am today
I like tech too much to be in the 1200s

did someone replace the CJ bot

Aysh is getting the feels here
`And in my small mind, I twisted someone else's happiness to mean there would be none left for me.`
this really helped me understand that jealousy/ comparing people etc are just.............. wastes of time
so in conclusion
/roll 1d20
Ill take 100K CJ
GIMME!
So the short answer is Aysh, is that more people will take the 50k because they get to live better than everyone else, than be more comfortable themselves.  To Doug's point, comfort is relative not absolute.
Which goes to <https://games-club-external.slack.com/archives/CDR5ZBTT7/p1582054961089400>

No I think we'll just give you random dragon and Molten Glass Golem facts
it was a low DC. the dragon does occasionally demand that you give 5-star reviews on iTunes, though.

For the record I feel like gloom haven would be fun to watch because of the social dynamics
Good morning <@UDC03KCGK> 
Let's all fly away together!
We've reached the conclusion we're bad at it.
Bad at gloom haven or bad at social dynamics?
Both?
Nice!
That's my favorite kind of failure :allthethings:
Well, we donated too much money away instead of getting better stuff.
We didn't jump into a room and funnel off the enemies. 
We got hit really hard early on, losing perks we had just earned. 
We've tried very hard to make up for lost perks, which meant the glass cannon decided to not use items...making them extra glassy, and not very cannony
Dakota's character watched enough of us die that he walked off in a huff and we got a medic instead
That sounds funny actual did Dakota become a medic?
When did folks here stop hoping they had super powers?
Stop? You’re never too old to be bitten by a radioactive spider. 
I mean actively hoping. Trying to move things with your mind. Hiding in a corner hoping you're invisible. Lighting candles with your fingertips and accidentally setting buildings on fire.
Not sure how applicable the open engineering positions are but American Well, my current company, is really nice!
I mean, I'm sure I do, the light changes green when I say green like 18% of the time, and if that's not a power, I don't want power
I can melt ice by touching it
Dakota is now a medic
With med packs and everything!
I'm still trying to time travel, if someone can help out
I would if I could, but I can't so I shan't
FANCY
<@UHQD9J1SL> are you going to make an entrepreneur channel here?
Uff. Should I?
I am not going to add people to this slack that I don't know well

WE COULD GIVE YOU IDEAS THOUGH!
So shouty, much loud
I have someone (legit) with legit ideas who is looking for someone to help with a prototype
For help
Fancier and Fancier
:fancy:
What kind of prototype are we talking about here?
Yeah my secret goal was to watch people die. We were very good at doing that, so My character retired earlier than I would imagine was intended
Now I'm a BoneSaw, which is apparently a mele meditc

wait- maybe this was something I sent
This is something you sent
Did this come up before?
No, it came up in the Wayfair slack
It came up in the Wayfair Slack that she was going to put an entrepreneur channel in this slack? Confusing
They suggested she make a slack external to WF, so I asked if she was thinking about putting it here

Don't you have stuff your supposed to be doing
Like off boarding your job?
So- the baby's name is NAVA, right?

Hell no
just name the name Aysh2
No no no, Aysh1
1.0.12
:happy_tear:
No sobbing children, just this Asian girl sniffing every three seconds next to me
having never met Marissa, I dont know if thats a reference to her
The one that wouldn't swap? Such a shame
Why do that, when you can just say you're bored?
It is not
gotcha
No I asked her to switch seats with me, has an interview apparently
i hope...not swapping seats helps with the interview?
If I were her, I wouldn't have swapped either
She wanted to get off the plane fast. I was in back
You would separate a couple?
Yes
Harsh
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
same. theyll survive.
If I had an aisle seat fairly near the front of the plane, damn well I'm keeping my seat unless it's a comparable swap
Sure they will survive, but it is a nice thing to do
I agree that a comparable swap is better but it's still nice. As long as I was getting the same type of seat I would
I'd swap if somebody asked, as long as i wasn't swapping to a middle seat or away from a window seat
i wouldn't even ask why. I don't really care if i'm first or last on the plane
I just want to get off the plane
Been sitting in these uncomfortable seats for far too long
I'm with Dakota
Marissa is third to last row
How long was your flight?
I'm near the front
6 hours
Because Mei takes me to Asia
Give or take
if the leg room is the same, then front or back makes no difference to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
During the flight, I agree
im not gonna refuse to switch out of spite- if its a better/ equal seat id be cool with it. but i dont think 'i want to sit with my partner' is like....sympathetic
It only really matters during unloading
Shoulda seen if Brenden's person wanted to switch seems like it would have worked out better
Yeah likely
I don't know why we didn't try that
Cause you fools!
It was most likely because it would be difficult to coordinate
:true:
With people boarding the plane
It's got much less to do with unloading than the actual flight in my opinion. Games can be played etc while on flight
Brenden wouldn't want to sit in back with me
:denied:
And we did, we asked the woman upfront
I would have come to the back
Hmmm interesting that it replaced and lowercased
Though I got more sleep than I probably would have back there
Your bot tells lies
More sleep might be accurate. I got 1.5 hours? Maybe?
Unsure on my end
Played 2 games of TM
And lost both of them???
He's bad
found it
Third person cannot replace the posts that start with I
but, it calls the replace method regardless of if there exists anything replaceable
Ohhhhhh, I was having problems getting that to work correctly
The third person bot triggers if I is detected, so it just replaces the whole string with a lowercase version
but it it fails to replace the starting I
Only lost 1
Soooo 50% lose rate
That's accurate
Do nothing be bored all the time
Im a lover alsoooooooooo a fighter alsoooooooooooooooooooooooooo

its a setting in slack
look at `/bot` as an example
I didn't because it was only meant to do one thing
oh, the spell isn't an arg?
if I want /cast to do more, I'll add argument
nah
it could be
but it's not
ah, well, I can't use it because I didn't set up an alias because I don't want to be censored
Ah, good point. I should fix that.
It's because people.py doesn't have a list of all users
Dakota, it should they're a baddie
i dont know if CJ is bad, Or I am bad, Or fireball is bad
why would baddies always fail?
You people don't know good internet insults
Baddies as in bad at the game not a villain
i thought 'cj is bad at casting fireballs'
I did
Didn't need Chaos seed for it though
youre a dedicated soul, Drew
No no no, it's their bad, as in " My bad I hit you with a fireball"
Or "my bad that the fireball fucked up"
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
My bot failed?
They're a baddie is so much better

Worse, he said your story was derivative. 
Good Morning! Kind of late, but it is still morning (which I don't remind people grabbing beers at 11am)
Brenden, not pinged due to timezones
Marissa, same thing
Doug, because Doug
<@UDDE5960N> because all of the pings!
<@UHQD9J1SL> pings people who don't have slack while at work
<@UDBGH9BMX> partner in resume sending
<@UK7V13DS7> in the final stretch
<@UDC4QL95G> Makes cast work...and not work at the same time
<@UTZJEALPP> basically came, said hi, then nothing else
<@UE2D3HCBW> same thing but about a year earlier
<@UTFFJEJ6P> we expect more out of her
<@UDTR9SLN4> had a T adventure
<@UDBV9N1E0> will need to be pinged a lot before we do Fury of Dracula
<@UDD45P5A9> the one you can only find in threads
<@UDC03KCGK> because it needs to be done
.....sorry :joy:
Threads are easiest to keep up with on mobile and me not being able to have my phone on me a lot at work
Totally understand that.
More like addicted. This is my only social media
Best social media ever?
Makes me bellow with laughter more for sure
I am Society.
I am Media.
I am....SOCIAL MEDIA
Ummmmm, Aysh what did you have?
Anemia
Yesterday i walked faster than automatic doors at the T station could handle and scraped my hands
Im Flash
Aysh is multitudinous

Does cast ever succeed? Magic seems to suck. 
<@UDL020K8D> `/cast` should work for you now
Not yet
and no, it doesn't work since I have not decided how exactly I want to apply a bot to a user for X messages, nor how I want users to be able to counter a cast on them
Just pay :mtg_blue::mtg_blue: 
I haven't figured out how I want Con/Wis/Dex/Int and Mana to actually work either
Cheap counterspell
No STR or CHA?
I want the confuse ray to either make their messages confusing, or make them post as random other bots for a period of messages
Evertying is hard on an event based system with sketchy persistent memory
Note: spells are in a list in the 'constants' folder:
currently:
```SPELLS = {
  'fireball': {
    'name': 'FIREBALL',
    'cost': 40,
    'duration': 25,
    'cast': 0,
    'effect': 'burn',
    'icon': '<https://emoji.slack-edge.com/TDBEDSEQZ/burn/297d37e5dadbe697.gif>'
  },

  }
}```
How much would a legit account cost on a monthly basis?
Yeah, and yet it seems to be fairly rare these days for that card to get reprinted
glitch doesn't have a paid plan. We'd have to go looking for another host.
oh yeah i am realzing that now
we could probably get on heroku, with a DB as well, for $7 a month
`In the future, you'll be able to upgrade resources and keep your app always on`
This seems like a massive oversight for glitch
The best part about glitch is that live coding environment. Without that the effort required to make bots would be too high
I just want to run everything in prod
we might be able to do that using serverless functions. like OpenWhisk
I think google cloud has serverless as well
God I hate networking
yeah so does AWS
Compared to glitch though, there is so much shit to set up. it's why I gave up on AWS. I'm thinking about making another glitch instance that will serve as just a place to make DB calls
I wish i was better with computers, I feel like programing needs a glitch like service where you can pay as you need to go up in tiers.  Like AWS and GC are very business/professional oriented
Where's my Teamspeak/Discord/Slack model where I pay as I need more stuff!
Well, editing in prod directly isn’t supposed to be a thing. 
Fuck that shit!
We’re sort of asking for something no one else would want. Hence using a dev tool. 
I mean it is perfect for getting people who dont code to play with code
I doubt that we're the only people who would be interested in this, it's more for the hobbist
Not pro grade stuff your thinking about
leave that to AWS and google, I'm talking a place where you start people off free, and as they build get better need more resources you start charging

I SAW THAT!
Well, learned something about editing a message in mobile
Double posting?
Oh man....that just repinged everyone too didn't it?
Probs
Woops
But there will be no ping for them to find
:confused-dino:
So yeah, if you edit a message on mobile, then go to a different channel, then come back, it just assumed you're writing a new message
That's....dumb
I don't even know who I am anymore
Also, this is not the first time that people have told me I should go by Daka
fancy
No one wants to call you Dakota
First Cody, then Daka, now Doug
Daka!
I wish as the owner of the slack I could override Dakota's name
I don't think I can pull off being a Doug
I'm sorry Daka!
Your name doesn't start with a D you're good
It's how we formed our immunity
Doug do you ever get confused as someone else?
:several_people_are_typing:
That's not what the channel topic says though
Like did you get called Drew or Dave?
<@UDD45P5A9> you can pull off any time you want. You can even be an Olaf if you so chose.
Acceptable
There's some existential body horror in this
I started my day with confronting my coworkers.............
kill me
What happened now?
It's just another unrealistic beauty standard
What did they do
Expecting everything to be set up for a temp user when you have 2 day notice. Great!! Especially when it's not your responsibility..........
<@UDC03KCGK> good morning

I don't know why the disappointed face
because you outed me
Ahhhhhh
Yea your way too nice
Gotta be meaner tougher angerier
Or just evi
Changing jobs is always soooo boring
isnt is scary and exciting?
not according to CJ
parasite is attacking at work...................... owwwwww
Nahhhh, boring.  Nothing to do. It's not scary because I have enough control, and it's not exciting because I'm struggling to figure out why they recruited me
maybe they need someone to fill a seat
Yup
My butt is keeping a seat warm
And they're paying me to do it
I'm sorry she's kicking you
But she's a really active baby and that's gotta be a good thing right?
<@UDC03KCGK> I modified scrambler odds, it's now 5/(word count^2) which is 20% at 5 words, and 5% at 10 words
Let me know if it's coming up too often
Any 2 words response will always be scrambled
I don't like always. Make it a good chance
I can't that's just how the math works out
5/4
well, scrambling a 2 word phrase is still a 50-50
True
you have to count the trivial scramble
what happens with 1 word
It auto skips 1 word
or does it always scramble that one word?
It's part of the logic to not do random replaces
`if  word_count&gt; 1 and self._randomUtil.rollDice(self._frequency/word_count**2):`
`if  word_count&gt; 1 and self._randomUtil.rollDice(self._frequency/word_count**2):`
if  word_count&gt; 1 and self._randomUtil.rollDice(self._frequency/word_count**2):
<https://everything2.com/title/Zen+Sort>
lol
So if you include the trivial sort, 2 words is 50%, 3 words is 46%
OMG, been trying to fix key system being down in my job for two days and no luck. IT has no clue how to fix it :stuck_out_tongue:
YOU EXIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Clearly the appropriate answer is to prepare a server sacrifice to the IT gods.  This is how Amazon and google have succeeded
I personally like to add in the throwing of a Junior IT professional, just to cover all the bases, but some people frown on the sacrifice of newbs, and demand we use a Senior person.  Always felt wasteful to me.
so thats how they have done things... :hmm:
Only the unholy things
nice
I want that job. Mine wants me to do stuff
nooooooooooo
`next(iter(next(iter(event.get('view').get('state').get('values').values())).values())).get('selected_option').get('value');`
favorite piece of code i have written all week
you're not very OO over there.
:lol: that is in prometheus
yeah, I've been trying to get it more OO]
yeah, that particular line is how you retrieve the target from the dropdown list of targets. I separated out the views, but slack is fond of passing me the entire select component with arbitrarily named components when I really just want it's value
That line of code looks.... painful
omg the nesting is out of control!
~YOU DONT KNOW WHAT PAIN IS~
I WILL BRING THE PAIN!
I'm a big fan of this one
Yeah cause they don't trust you with shit and you just sit there bored
I don't understand how it significantly affects the math
Oh, that
Which is indeed what happened
You have super high rates for low word counts and super low rates for high word counts. The scaling is much more aggressive
Like I said if seems too much let me know. I'm not happy with 2 words but you generally don't use them
I think it funny when it replaced me and kept it the same
If it stops being funny let me know. Otherwise I'm gonna let it ride
Will do. The long messages being replaced too frequently is the only time it bothers me

Got tickets for PAX East
For Friday specifically

Did we lose a deja vu emote or something?
No he got overwritten
Not sure why drew keeps losing his profile pic though
somebody opt into thread notifications with `/chaos`  please. I am testing something
Dunno, would be nice to fix it
Overwritten and posted out of order...because reasons?
I'm working on other things
Strangely relevant
Ya'll are more active on Slack than I would expect for after 6pm
dunno what to tell you
OPTED IN BITCH
I was playing with Prometheus. Then I realized it was 7:30 and went home. Can't test anymore, though you should notice the change is persistent
I'm assuming you can't opt out once you opt in?
Can my alter ego be called Aysh/ Ayshy. This one doesn't really fit
Sure, easy change. 
any last name, or just Ayshy?
You don't want to make it too similar then it takes a lot of thinking to avoid them
Good morning :new_moon_with_face: :first_quarter_moon_with_face:
Summon the silent
Sleepy good morning to youu
<@UDC03KCGK>  Why wouldn't you be able to opt out?
But that's the purpose!
Happy Mardi Gras // Fat Tuesday // Pancake Tuesday
Good Morning, WHY ARE YOU MESSAGING US AT 3AM EST?
No the purpose is `Gotcha` not to actually confuse people
Although the :dejavu: probably gives away too easily now
IT'S ALIVE!!!!
Its alot of things today apparently :stuck_out_tongue:
Today is a day of DOOMMMMMMMM!!!!!
Eh, the first three are all the same thing. 
<@UPGVCMGD9> are you back or still in Seattle?
I think they're flying back on the red eye right now
Because once you opt into the chaos, you can never return
They get back within the next 30 minutes
I like how many people celebrate Mardi gras but don't give a flying fuck about lent
Many more people care about All Saint's Day Eve than All Saint's Day
I mean a party is a party drew
Also, pancakes are delicious and should be consumed always but def on fat Tuesday
we also had pączkis
(there are a lot of Polish people in Western Michigan)
Someone figured out how to make Nets work in :dnd: and now I really want to try it out
It's a Kensi monk, although I feel like a fighter with finesse weapons would work.  You get the sharpshooter feat so you can throw the net at 15 feet normal
Because my flight was delayed and I was up at 12am PST
We were also up at 2am pst
I mean you were on a flight
welcome home!
Just landed
:sleepdeprivedface:
I mean celebrating food is always wonderful.
or you just get the DM to fiat that nets work. because its dumb that they don't in RAW
rule of cool
I don't disagree, but it does become a kind of fun problem to solve, too bad it's really hard to get Rogues net proficiency
are you giving up something for lent?

sleeping on flights is horrible
Yes. But sleeping is better than not sleeping, especially when trying to deter jet lag
sorry, i meant trying to get to sleep is horrible. I am rarely able to fall asleep unless i stay up all night the night before
Ah yes, agreed, sleeping aids are also helpful
I have never taken one myself. They kinda scare me
I normally use benadryl, but I only take it if I'm traveling with someone
No problems with sleeping here!
Wowza
I'm bored....... and tired
help
?
turn off your company's internet and play the chrome dinosaur game
Make more slash commands
You don't have to turn off the internet, they have the game standalone
pinned message
Yea but it's more fun when you turn it off because then everyone else freaks out
ah, missed that. skipped up to the emote list
/roll d20-1
its more fun when the whole office has to play
what's everybody up to?
about to go to a meeting
ewwwww
I have 2 hours of meetings soon
I'm not looking forward to it
I'm attempting to make it through the day
*without coffee or any other form of caffeine
why though? why not coffee?
drink decaff. The coffee taste will trick your mind into thinking it has caffeine
I don't drink caffeine
or try not to
but do you snort it?
Assuming he's mind associates coffee with caffeine
I don't imbibe any form of caffeine on a regular basis
and my mind associates coffee flavor with beer
or grossness
so there's that
lol
I see
GUYS I FINALLY DID IT
you are still on RB?
DB
ah
need to deploy a new column
Some teams still do RB
The team I am moving to lets the engineers choose
I find PRs easier to follow, but RBs easier to review
with our repo PRs ping our channel. Our average time to review is like 10 minutes
is that a webhook?
yup
have any instructions handy for that?
might do something similar for our team
Are you in your own repo? If your team works in the monolith you are kinda out of luck
no monolith here :thumbsup:
we have 3-6 tiny repos
I'd love to do the same for new RBs created by certain people as well
you have to add the github app to your channel
it generates a url, you attach it to the repo
I forget if we needed an admin to help us or not
I'm having trouble linking the github app to my wayfair github account
:hmm:
I forget the details. we did it months ago
oh, its the "GitHub Enterprise Server" app
not the "GitHub" app
thanks!
words
anyone have VR knowledge?
what games seem worthwhile?
The beat saber seems super popular
<@UDC4QL95G> will have better suggestions
Kinda? More of going the opposite route for once
&gt; beat saber
&gt; skyrim
&gt; superhot
Also <@UDBGH9BMX> does VR stuff
those are the ones I see all the time
also:
&gt; blade &amp; sorcery
I haven't played it in VR, but superhot is awesome
BEAT SABER
2+5 is 7 but 4+3 is also 7
well assuming I like enough games to consider buying a headset, what headset should I look at?
rift s seems reasonable
CJ is in Copley now!
MORE LUNCH GAMES!
Fuck if I know, I know that headsets are always a big push at PAX
Yes I am Aysh
Still onboarding so my calendar is a little crazy
what's your address?
are you on 3?
2?
I'm with the BAMs on 1
T1
BAM?
Silence Chaos Seed
Quality wise, Valve Index &gt; Vive Pro &gt; Everything else
video quality sure
index controllers as well
Also head tracking
I hear the valve is a bit outdated on the motion tracking
cameras vs inside-out tracking
So there are 2 main technologies out there currently:
Base stations and Inside-out tracking
Base station cameras while more combersome and inconventient to set up, offer much more reliable tracking
do you have a rig?
Yeah I have an OG HTC Vive
what did you play on it?
Quite a few games:
Accounting
Arizona Sunshine
Beat Saber
Blad and Sorcery
Boneworks
Budget Cuts
Climbey...
Those are most of the ones I own
Business Account Managers
Basically Sales people
I'm in the middle of a sales floor
Honestly there aren't any on that list that i wouldn't recommend
Accounting?
Really funny game
I should put together a VR night...
Was thinking of doing that if I got a rig
That's a fun placement, how close to the going are you?
If you want something that is kinda cheap but works well, the one <@UHQD9J1SL> got i think is the recommendation
Oculus Quest
yeah, I want steamvr though
An Index is the Best right now, but it's sold out, and without a good open area, might not be worth the asking price
my laptop supports these headsets
I don't use my Vive all that much. If you like I can toss it in a backpack, and family share you my games on steam to play
the thing is getting old, so it isn't in tip top shape, but if you wanna try it out for a week i'd be willing
Pretty close, I have Pat leave coming up
So I'll stick around for that
I'm gonna petition for the open role above me, that might make me stick around for longer
One thing to note about VR headests:
You WILL lose interest in playing very frequently
The longest games are ~5 hours or so, and there are only so many worth playing
It still feels very "fadish" to me
Less of a fad and more of a niche I think.
Get the weight down, make it wireless, replace the controllers with gloves, and make it cheaper, and i think it could become more popular
Nah the space requirement will always hold it back
Who's gonna have a dedicated VR room in the house
You don't need a whole room. My current apartment has enough room for VR in both my living room and Bedroom
Yea but what I'm saying Dakota is how interesting can you make a game where the only thing the player can move is their hands and eyes?
It eventually only becomes games where the player is sitting, and that's not enough diversity. Maybe like you said Niche, but niche of niche is a labor of love
Unless someone comes up with a good universal treadmill
MATH!
Nah I don't think treadmill will take over. User interface is really the only thing holding back VR. Either super sophisticated golves, or some sort of link to your brain
In a perfect world we figure out full immersion, but that will probably not happen in my lifetime
I'm more so saying why bother with super sophisticated gloves when the current solution a controller does it just as well.  Mind reading is going to result in full immersion before VR would catch main stream
All these controllers brag about their finger tracking capabilities. Why not just make it a full glove. With the entire hand tracked perfectly in 3d, you could do away with buttons and use gestures for any actions needed
Playing the game without having to physically hold something would be amazing. A huge step up in immersion
I'm more saying the average consumer doesn't want to pretend they're Naruto in order to play a game
Have y'all read Ready Player One? Because the rig you're describing is the one in the book
I agree Dakota, but you're going to find that games that execute that well will be games that require you sitting
In ready player one, they have universal treadmills
Nah, first person shooters would be insane
No, because moving becomes a chore
not at all
how do you move forward and hold a gun?
Not everyone uses the treadmills, most players just have the headset and gloves
Hold a gun, lift pointer of forward hand to move forward while looking down sight for examp
Thumb of further back hand left and right for strafing
so each game is going to make you memorize minute movement gestures?
Ideally the movement would be intuitive and effeectively universal
if every game controls the same way, you won't think about it. If those controls are intuitive, then problem solved
Yes, but each game is going to have a different "resting" hand gesture
A sword game is a fist, a gun game is a pointer
Yup, not sure what the problem there is
it's the same issue with controllers. Hell you could just mimic a joystick with your left hand for all movement in every game if you wanted to do a basic control scheme
Already here
I'm with CJ, the space and the problems solved by having a universal treadmill are the big things to me.
Because different games have different hand resting positions, they will require different movement gestures. Not standardized, not adopted. If I'm going to have one hand do joystick things cheaper to just do the joystick
You haven't even tried a VR headset drew
Because right now, I look at VR as an ability to immerse myself in a room, not a dungeon. Frankly, most people just don't have the space for VR physically.
I have not, but I represent a pretty sizeable consumer base that looks at the space reqs and go "oh no way in my apartment"
Yeah. Having space for the vive was a big factor in chosing the apartment I am in TBH
I have, and most of the games that I've played on you list are stationary
Wait what? All of the games benefit from moving, except for subnautica
except maybe Beat saber
And job simulator
Ohhh and elite dangerous
Elite dangerous is WAY better in a full room
Standing still in that game sucks
Job simulator _can_ be played stationary, but again is better if you have a bit of freedom of movement
oh wait elite dangerous is a sitdown game nvm
I was mixing up that and Space Pirate Trainer
Haven't played the later, I'm just saying the limits aren't going to drive enough adoption outside of hardcore fans
Long line at the library for early voting, but it’s moving fast. Past three people encouraging votes for Bernie, no other camps obviously represented.

More about abiding by wishes
I’m refactoring order wizard banners. It’s this old system that was already bad three years ago and only gotten worse. It feels a lot like the Prometheus bot refactor project. 
It's good to know we code just as well as the pros!
Networking problems are the worst. 
<https://xkcd.com/2259/>
Wait, banners are finally getting refactored!
Where people take on a new good habit or acts of kindness instead
Man the all company questions are pretty much all layoff related
there are a few that aren't
and I upvoted those
You just gotta wait 7 more weeks to poop it out
<@UETS9HTSS> yea, directly related to how we get paid
You have to go down 6 questions to get to, YOU FUCKED US OVER
I love you!
I feel like the busies an organization pretends to be, the shittier they are at onboarding

Videlectrix, that's a deep cut
That is old
#deep-fried
deep fried cold foods always confused me
Deep fried icecream is great
Yes, but I don't get how there's still ice cream inside. Do they refreeze it??? WHY DOES IT NOT MELT!?!?!
body is cold, skin is hot.
that's just how objects in 3D work
Heat transfers, so like there's a thin gap layer of melty goodnees
And temperature differential plays into heat transfer so something at like 200 degrees should transfer a decent amount of heat on contact
It is a quick dip in the fryer, so only the outside gets cooked. The fried dough cools off really quick
you get a crispy skin, then it is immediatly overwhelmed by the coldness. Fried icecream is cold
Like extra cold? WHY DOESN'T IT EXPLODE LIKE A TURKEY!?!?!
don't turkeys explode cuz evaporating water?
that was my understanding
I just know that Frozen Turkey+Deep fryer =caboom
if done wrong
you can deep fry a turkey without exploding
A frozen turkey?
Or just a turkey?
just a turkey
thawing it is probably part of the requirements for it not exploding
it's the frozen ones that cause issues
Yes but we're discussing frozen goods
Other than turkey
like ice cream or butter
Why do only frozen turkey's explode, wouldn't the same effect exist for butter or icecream? Are we saying the moisture content for a turkey is higher?
sublimation?
there is a Good Eats episode on the subject
```So, when the ice from a frozen turkey meets a vat of hot oil, it instantly changes to steam and expands to 1,700 times its original volume. This can cause the oil to bubble over and if an oil particle makes contact with a flame — boom — you're in trouble.```
Ohhhhhhh
Ice cream should sublimate then.... unless it's just not big enough to affect enough oil.
well fuck that shit, premise is ice cream small turkey big
ice cream doesn't have liquid water
the moisture is all mixed with milk fats
So it's vaporization temp is higher?
or it vaporizes slower
or even with vaporization, the expansion isn't enough for the vat to overflow considering the relative volume when compared to a turkey
Hmmmm now I want to know if the melting point of icecream is higher or lower than water
Right icecream small turkey big
water doesn't melt
true, usually the turkey is nearly the size of the fryer
Sematics daka, you want me to refer to it as H2O from now on?
<@UDC4QL95G> chemically, the statement "melting point of water" is correct
like how I can say freezing point of iron
its just that english has a second word for frozen water
Either way, doesn't the ice cream get dipped in batter, so the ice cream isn't actaully touching the oil at all?
CJ you'll like this: `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpemba_effect>`
Basically the outer layer gets fried super quick, then acts as an insulating layer. The ice cream is in the fryer for so little time that the ice cream doesn't have time to melt. Then the ice cream cools down the outer layer since the heat source is gone, and there isn't much heat trapped in the skin
So basically you're arguing that the inner part of the dough is not as cooked as the outer part
No? If you dip your hand in oil real quick, your skin is gonna be burnt as hell but the muscle and bone is going to be less affected.
the heat doesn't reach the majority of the icecream
Just like heat doesn't reach a majority of our exploding turkey
Also Daka, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidenfrost_effect>
The turkey doesn't explode. It is the ice on the outside of the turkey
Ice cream is pretty much Ice with some solids in it
what? no
I went it and looked it up, the melting temp of ice cream is 31 degrees
that doesn't tell you its rate of expansion
there are a lot of factors other than melting point
And because when you get into boiling temps you start getting separation of compounds so the explosive part of Ice is in ice scream
Not for mixtures doug, these aren't new compounds
but that separation itself can soak up energy
Ehhhhhh, how much energy do you think salt water requires vs. pure water? Not a lot is my imagination
I think that is just wrong.
Unless i had a crazy high specific heat and then you're basically just putting heat sinks in there
if you try to fry water it explodes. frying ice cream doesn't
you're underestimating the chemical reaction.
_*Mixtures don't have a defined melting or boiling point*_. It will probably start melting a little under zero °C, due to freezing point depression, and might start boiling around 100 °C, but as you attempt to boil it further it will likely turn into a fatty mess and begin to blacken and burn.
it isn't about melting point
its about rate of expansion
Boiling point is the discussion
Because it changes from solid to gas and that cause the expansion
and you just ignored the question of rate
Water actual shrinks from ice to water, hence why water floats
water turns to gas very fast
And ice cream is a majority of water
that clearly doesn't matter. a little bit of fat goes a long way
ice cream vaporizes much slower than ice
that's why it doesn't epxlode
you are also missing the point that the ice cream itself is not actually the thing being fried...
Sooooo you expect that ice cream acts like <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pykrete>
```The ice cream itself is not fried. It is surrounded by batter (like a donut) which is fried -- quickly enough that most of the ice cream doesn't melt, especially as the batter acts as a heat insulator.```
Which i will agree with as long as we understand that the batter that is touching the icecream CANNOT be as cooked as the outer layer of batter
is cooking linear?
is there a plateau?
note the pykrete is also majority water.so clearly that doesn't matter.

if you try to fry ice cream is will just dissolve, it won't explode
Heat transfer is not quiet linear but it can be a decent approximation
The ice cream is also frozen well below freezing temp, so even though the outer layer of ice cream does melt as well, once it is removed form the oil, the ice cream quickly refreezes as the temperature normalizes
I really want you to test your logic doug, but I really don't want you to die on me.
So no cj, the batter does not necessarily have to be less cooked on the inside than the outside
<@UDC03KCGK> I just want you to know I've take your place in this argument
today's ban sucks
I guess if you want to super freeze the ice cream sure. I guess the question i have then is the ice cream out layer a different texture, since refreezing ice cream doesn't work well because it no longer has the proper air content
which one could argue air content of ice cream makes it natually more insulated
Probably not, however the outer layer that must refreeze touching the batter, so a slight texture difference on the outside of the ice cream will be attributed to the batter
ever had deep-dried coca-cola?
Nope
its pretty good. I wouldn't recommend having it more than one in your life, for health reasons, but tasty
WTF DID I JUST WALK INTO!?!?!?
`Does our senior leader think that it's appropriate to comment, 'You look horrible' to a junior female employee?`
Where are you seeing this?
`Does the senior team have a good sense of which employees are working weekends, which are stressed to the point of crying, and which aren't, and why?`
This is for our Director's all hands
these are questions
Link? (in wayfair if that is more appropriate)
`Does our senior leader think it's appropriate to pressure junior employees to drink beyond what they're comfortable with?`
`Can pod outings/bonding be incorporated into work hours? With families, commutes, personal life it's hard to commit but it feels like there's pressure to attend`
Do other teams not have pod outings during work sometimes?
I don't think I've had one start before 4pm
and they typically go late into the evening
Jesus these are awful...
Right, this is terrifying
Apparently your senior leadership are assholes. Come back to service R&amp;D
i only know teams that do work hour- pod outings
OMG who is that senior leader!
CJ- tae their  job
I'm with brenden generally we've done it after 4
This convo is awkward
I want to see more of these questions
Daka can post them, I'm in a meeting
this is mental!
why dont thye name the 'senior leader'?
Dunno anonymity?
I'm surprised they don't considering the forum is anonymous
Got me, but this is terrifying
Depends on how much you really care about what the big boss thinks i suppose. Let the big boss rant and rave for all I care
Oh god, now they're calling him out
This is a joke
Callin out the L6
Yea
OH he's pretty new too
started last year
/roll 1d20
Yea, this is a kinda shit show
`Senior Leader and "the senior leader" is pretty obviously Subho in most if not all of these cases. It is an understanding among the rest of us.` :chefs_kiss:
Where did that come from?
I bet they delete some questions before they start
Oh man the drinking response was hilarious
drinking?
Its happening now
I was just doing a quick look to see
And then :shocko:
I NEEDDDDDDDD
can i remote in?
what was  the response!
Nooooo you can't it's all done
tell me the deets!
what meeting was this?
:i_need_it:
:i_need_it_spongebob:
So for the forcing alcohol on people, apparently they were doing an xmas pod outing and he wasn going around offering drinks "enthusiastically" but that should be in no way construed as forced
CSOT all hands
Which was HILIARIOUS when the HR lady said "No he does not approve" for him!
That whole meeting was a shit show start to finish
In a "this is great" kidna way or "oh god im screwed" kinda way
Clearly Subho answered all the questions correctly
cant tell if :sarcasm:
"This is great, i get to fiddle while the world burns"
hahhahahah ahhahahahhahahahahhaha
No i mean literally all corporate appropriate responses
So no, well duh you should drink as much as I tell you
Very corporate answers
what about the 'you look horrible' comment
No senior leaders should not tell people they look horrible, male or female.  However they was a sick person who called in and I said they looked terrible, within context that should be ok
sounds about right
yeah actually
So without the actual incident, it's all meaningless lip service
Which is why they're all correct answers
Man... imagine if hubot just jumped into #nonwork-activism with the slido link and event id...
...............'hubot'
Those are all comments and concerns that were rampant when I was in merch, one of the reasons I felt the need to leave
Let's not spurn the fires in the new place I joined until I have an exit strategy please
why would this be bad?
I imagine they would have a hayday with evidence of a director treating employees so badly
`Subho is saying to tell him directly when he's expecting too much. But when he is told directly, I've only ever see him say they are wrong.` That's my new favorite question
I love the fact it's no longer questions but statements
Deep fried Oreos are my guilty pleasure
Also how were you in "my place" in this argument <@UDDE5960N>? My theory was just that we often have the one person ganged up on by many in this channel whenever there's a debate.
Drew I think you're wrong
Does everyone else agree with me?
Usually that person is you
I only ever had after hour ones
Yup drew is certainly wrong.
<@UHQD9J1SL> tell him why
Usually it is Dave! Or Daka when talking about voting.
Or you about anything else
:lolguy:
I don't feel particularly ganged up on here except for bringing up this effect
Which is why I was saying I took your place, because I was being the one ganged up on
But then you decided to bring it upon yourself, I feel no guilt
Which is why I was saying I took your place, because I was being the one ganged up on
Good morning!
<@UDBGH9BMX> oops, sorry you weren't on this yesterday
<@UUL45BDKR> Good morning and welcome!

I'm here in spirit, but not in person!
Good morning Drew!
....didn't you?
Good morning <@UHQD9J1SL>!
Nope, I'm a card (wo)man, all about them cards
Busy day! Baby enrolled in day care, car loan paid off and closed out
Mei in Boston with a perfectly timed drop off
Daycare? Isn't baby still cooking?
Yes but daycare fills up ours is 1-2 mon
Huh. Who'd a know?
One of the roles in the casino is Card Sharp. I think in American slang Card Shark is far so common, so it kind of threw me at first when I saw it. 
Maybe I was playing wrong, but I didn't really rely on the roles too much, more the situation
That is totally fine. The roles are a thing to help you answer if you’d like. There really isn’t a wrong way to play. Except Drew’s way. 
:p
I still don't know how that was able to work
Good morning <@UHQD9J1SL>! Literally got mixed up after deciding to put the "I-shh" with Doug since it made more sense than next to you
It got me the results I wanted
congrats!!!
<@UETS9HTSS> looks like somebody is selling an OG vive for 375 in nonwork
So anybody want these PAX Friday badges before I try to peddle them off
I'm good
FOREVER
Wait, when did brian join?
what time does this start/end?
Yea it was good
<@UDC4QL95G> mechs vs minions $65
Mechs vs Minions is another campaign based game, which is why I never bought it. It's best with a dedicated group to play
Ohhhh boooo
It's one of those games where you have to program your mech, then everybody's mechs act simultaneously across 5 or 6 actions. You do missions and your character levels up while killing minions and stuff over the course of the mission
someone started #nonwork-compensation channel
I wonder why it's called nonwork
<@UDDE5960N> check boyl community experience for a chuckle
were you trying to 'give it away' by leaving it for people to find???
Nah It caught on the lip of my phone case.
<@UDC4QL95G> good job buddy dropping shit everywhere
Worst part was I already had buyers for the other three, so I woulda been out of luck
Nice glad you found buyers
Yeah it was pretty nice. Had 3 to sell, and requests to buy 3.
Lol, I was walking the floor for most of the day
Brenden even forgot to eat
quiet day here
I probably need to convince mei to let me spend like 200 bucks
for what?
60 is for :dnd: stuff, 70 for hanabi with tiles, 60 for twilight empire for a 2 player game
worth it
Or kingdomino I'm really looking for something thats good for 2 or more
Well, I'll be at PAX around 9:30 to get my ticket from Will Call. <@UDDE5960N>, <@UDC4QL95G>, <@UDBV9N1E0> you all going to be there? Anyone I missed?
Tonight???
I haven't decided when I want to get there yet.
Tomorrow CJ
Doesn't the floor close at like 5 every day
6
Friday, 9:30am
I thought, but that's the floor it runs till 10
So what time do you think you'll be there tomorrow?
Probably earlier, I ran all my errands today because I want to do some early panels tomorrow
Probably closer to noon
Mostly because I'm probably taking the train with mei
:hr_ticket_intensifies:
no i still  see it
Doesn't the floor not open till 10?
Uhhhhhh PAX is known as the line waiting simulator
Theres a line to get in at 10
You mean the modded ones like "Duhcoatah Quelley" and "CJ O'Stabby"?
What panels are you thinking about?
I recommend you "On Using Games for Learning" @ PAX East 2020.
(Sent from the mobile app: <http://essaie.ca/app/paxeast-2020|http://essaie.ca/app/paxeast-2020> )

<@UDC03KCGK> either of those they overlap
I also want to remember to attend this
When will they share a link for it?
Uhhhh I don't know I'm gonna be calling in probably
Its our favorite word!
I thought the locust plague was in East Africa. What is happening to the world?
We need captain planet!
Pakistan would be firmly south East Asia so this is super wide spread :pensive:
locust swarms are natural. Captain planet might be anti-chinese-duck on this one.
<@UDC03KCGK> here! I'll see you at 9:30 also the lines have already started
Figured. I've been to PAX East before. It isn't San Diego Comic Con
Yea
We're walking to china town for pork buns, and then I walk back to BCEC
Grab me 3 seseme seed balls please!
Ok!

Scale matters doug. This was triggered by increasing temperatures
true. still think Captain Planet might be at a loss of what to do when you're talking about importing species to react to a natural lifecycle event of another animal that itself was intensified by human action.
He will beat up the owners of corporations contributing to the climate change that will set off a series of events resulting in the locusts dying naturally. Come on.
That part certainly yes. Captain Planet is no fan of CEOs.

yeah... its pretty bad
BORING
<@UDBGH9BMX> we played your lame sounding train game drew killed us at 100m on easy
Mei trying to get me to cancel sunday plans because baby/wedding
who is NOT at PAX?
:raised_hand:
blah its boring
PAX is fun to see stuff you won't normally find. I only really enjoy talking to devs
no i m,eant im bored
not that pax is boring
start a fire
id rather start a water- how can i do that
cry?
:cry:
Really had fun playing Unrailed today. <@UDBGH9BMX>, good suggestion!
<@UDC03KCGK> I think this is the prefect length
Oh yeah, you can piece it together, I can rewrite it easily if need be. Funny without being a pain in the ass
I had mentioned this to <@UDDE5960N> that I hadn't played all my games from the last Steam Sale before I went ahead and got Unrailed but couldn't remember what all those games were.
The one I forgot was Witcher 3.
Could be a bit before I've gotten caught up!
Also the reviews I get from Unrailed are that it is strictly multiplayer, and that the game isn't actually meant for one person to handle 2 characters at once (despite that being an option someone could do in any simple controller 2 co op mode)
It's a fun read
<https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/spread-of-corporate-speak.html|https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/spread-of-corporate-speak.html>

it's in early access
like $16
Yes and it's now 12 because 25% discount
Booooooo

Good Morning Victoria!
Good morning
Life starts too early in the morning
I am both very motivated this morning, but also wish it was Friday again
YEA MOTIVATION!!!!
<@UDC03KCGK> Good Morning! You deserved to be pinged because no one else was pinged
Good morning!
Scrambler only works on 4 or more words now <@UDC03KCGK>
GOOD MORNING
and so it begins
:beer::coronavirus2:
is that your team?
epidemics/pandemics are a great time for introverts
we don't wilt in isolation
Nah that's a sister team that I work with.
I'm still in a gray area when it comes to what team I am on
Ah, I kinda liked it how it was, but whatever, your bot to tinker with
You describe yourself as an introvert?
describe do yes, introvert myself as I an
That definitely took you more effort than it did me. Huh, I just don't usually think of you as an introvert since you have so many different game nights and DnD sessions with people
I like to classify myself as an introvert with learned extroverted tendencies
I love the way everyone's dying already
There's still like another 3 weeks before we're all doomed
I learned to act extroverted at school/work to succeed, but consider myself a hard core introvert
I definitely enjoy those things <@UDC03KCGK> but I recharge with alone time
I'm certainly not arguing that you are one, just that you must have a lot of energy, or find ways to get a lot of time to yourself, because otherwise I would expect you to be absolutely wiped out by the number of social situations you put yourself in
oh no
&gt; Meant to mention this earlier, when I came in this morning, in the T2 elevators, 2nd elevator from the right looking from the floor 3 lobby, the handrail on the left side towards the front of the elevator (also looking from the lobby) comes off with a very slight pull 
Brenden is breaking shti!
9/10pm to 1am is typically my time
also sunday evenings
That Chaos seed seems sooooo sad.....
Also Brenden, 1 am!?!?!?!
:taiyaki: is probably my favorite discovery in Japan
:pacman::taiyaki:
So, i got an interesting call from my mom yesterday morning.
She is a pre-k special education teacher, so she has a lot of contact with her children's parents.

One of the student's parents called my mom and let her know that the parent had received a call from her son, who is apparently a relatively highly ranked military officer. This officer rarely calls home, and when he does, it is usually important.

The military officer advised his mom that something is happening up the chain in the Govt. relating to the virus, and it would be a good idea to start stocking up on water, non-perishables, and other essentials (2+ weeks worth), but couldn't tell her any more than that.

Now this like, 4th hand info at this point, so take it as you will, but i figure it cant hurt to have some extra non-perishables around either way.
I already told mei and my parents. I wonder if they're going to try to quarantine.....
Yeah, my mom _does_ tend exhadurate, so Idunno if she embellished some of the details or not, but better to stock up now, than to try to stock up when everybody else is.
<@UHQD9J1SL> why don't you like Chaos Seed
Mei got her asian stuff last night, and we're getting American stuff tonight
I'm got a bunch of stuff yesterday morning. I'll kinda just stock up over time since I go past a grocery store on my way home.
I've got some camping mres left from my last trip, though I should probably get some more water
yeah, I typically fall asleep at around 1am
1am to 8:15am is a bit over 7 hours of sleep
i wish I could run on that little sleep consistently
I'm more of the 8.5 to 9 guy
Daka, where does your mom life
Live
Illinois
`/chaos` the preferences for thread messaging are actually required now
Water I'm not worried about. Shit really has to hit the fan for utilities to go during an epidemic. Food is where its gonna suck
Yeah I picked up a couple cases just cuz they are so cheap
Do we get stickers? `I survived the 2020 plague`
If there're no stickers, let the plague take me now
That'll be so sad!!!
I want stickers, stickers are life
They give us stickers for voting
we should get stickers for living
I can function for quite a few days on like 5
almost a week
WTF!?!?!?!
Man I start getting sick I don't get normal amounts of sleep 7-9 hours
when I get really into a book, I just stay up until I finish it or fall asleep
usually I finish it at like 3-4am
if I find a new video game to get into; 1am turns into 2am
I am trying for three in a row
I become so much more stabby with lack of sleep, boooooo 2 for 3
it just occurred to me that we have a contraction for "I am" but not it's future or past states
so no contraction for "I will" or "I was"
I'll
I'll agree with I was though
whoops
that's even weirder then
bonus, I was doesn't work, but I would become I'd
done
Today is sooooo boring
what are some non-perishables that one could stock up on?
Pasta, dried meats, dried veggies, canned anything, pickled anything
Freezer stuff
dried veggies ?
never heard of that
Same Brenden
I go with things that can be left out a room temp since people have pretty limited freezer space
Kale chips, (fruit things are coming to mind over veggies)
<@UDDE5960N> why am I being impersonated?

Chaos is a genus of amoebae, in the family Amoebidae. The largest and best-known species, the so-called "giant amoeba" (Chaos carolinense), can reach lengths of 5 mm, although most specimens fall between 1 and 3 mm.[2][3][4]

Members of the genus closely resemble Amoeba and share the same general morphology, producing numerous cylindrical pseudopods, each of which is rounded at the tip.[5] However, while Amoeba have a single nucleus, Chaos can have as many as a thousand. Because of this attribute, C. carolinensis was once placed in the genus Pelomyxa along with the other giant multinucleate amoeba, Pelomyxa palustris. Recently, molecular phylogenetic studies of this species have confirmed the view of some earlier researchers[6] that it is more closely related to Amoeba than to Pelomyxa.[7] The species is now placed in the independent genus Chaos, a sister group to Amoeba.
Chaos species are versatile heterotrophs, able to feed on bacteria, algae, other protists, and even small multicellular invertebrates.[3] Like all Amoebozoa, they take in food by phagocytosis, encircling food particles with its pseudopodia, then enclosing them within a food ball, or vacuole, where they are broken down by enzymes. The cell does not have a mouth or cytostome, nor is there any fixed site on the cell membrane at which phagocytosis normally occurs.
The cell's membrane, or plasmalemma, is extremely flexible, allowing the organism to change shape from one moment to the next. The cytoplasm within the membrane is conventionally described as having two parts: the internal fluid, or endoplasm, which contains loose granules and food vacuoles, as well as organelles such as nuclei and mitochondria; and a more viscous ectoplasm around the perimeter of the cell, which is relatively clear and contains no conspicuous granules. Like other lobose amoebae, Chaos move by extending pseudopodia. As a new pseudopod is extended, a variable zone of ectoplasm forms at the leading edge and a fountaining stream of endoplasm circulates within. The effort of describing these motions, and explaining how they result in the cell's forward movement, has generated a large body of scientific literature.
The genus Chaos has had a long and often confusing history. In 1755, Rösel von Rosenhof saw and depicted an amoeboid he named "der kleine Proteus" ("the little Proteus").[10] Three years later, Linnaeus gave Rösel's creature the name Volvox chaos. However, because the name Volvox had already been applied to a genus of flagellate algae, he later changed it to Chaos chaos. In subsequent decades, as new names and species proliferated, accounts of Chaos, under a variety of synonyms, became so thoroughly entangled with descriptions of similar organisms, that it is virtually impossible to differentiate one historic amoeboid from another. In 1879, Joseph Leidy suggested collapsing all the "common" large, freshwater amoebae into one species, which he proposed to call Amoeba proteus. A dozen species, including several that had been identified as belonging to Chaos, were to be regarded as synonyms of Amoeba proteus. However, in the description he gives of this organism, it is clearly defined as a uninucleate amoeba, unlike the modern Chaos.[11]


A. proteus (=C. chaos), from Joseph Leidy, 1879
In 1900, the biologist H. V. Wilson, at the University of North Carolina, discovered and isolated a giant amoeba that resembled Amoeba proteus but had cellular nuclei numbering in the hundreds. Since there existed already a genus of giant multinucleate amoebae, Pelomyxa, Wilson placed his organism in that taxon, naming it Pelomyxa carolinensis.[2] This amoeba was easily cultivated and became a widely distributed and studied laboratory organism.

In 1926, Asa A. Schaeffer argued that Pelomyxa carolinensis was, in fact, identical to the amoeba that had been seen by Rösel in 1755, the "little Proteus" which Linnaeus had named Chaos chaos. Therefore, he urged that, in keeping with the principle of priority governing biological nomenclature, the name of the organism should be Chaos chaos. Several investigators argued vigorously against the validity of that name,[12][13] but others adopted it. A third faction accepted the validity of the genus Chaos for Wilson's amoeba, but retained the second half of the binomial, referring to the organism as Chaos carolinensis.[14] By the early 1970s, all three names were in use concurrently, by various investigators. However, studies of the fine structure and physiology of the amoeba made it increasingly clear that there were profound differences between it and the other Pelomyxa (including the complete absence, in true Pelomyxa, of mitochondria).[15] Since then, a nomenclatural consensus has emerged, and today the organism is generally known as Chaos carolinensis, as first proposed by Robert L. King and Theodore L. Jahn in 1948.
Until quite recently, the genus Chaos was included, along with all other protists that extend lobose pseudopods or move about by protoplasmic flow, in the phylum Sarcodina.[16] Molecular phylogenies based on the examination of ribosomal DNA, have shown that Sarcodina is a polyphyletic grouping: that some amoeboids shared a more recent common ancestor with members of other phyla than with other Sarcodina. Consequently, the amoeboids of Sarcodina have been distributed among two newly created supergroups, Rhizaria and Amoebozoa. Chaos and its close relative, Amoeba, are now placed in the latter, within the order Tubulinida: naked amoebas (lacking a test, or shell), either monopodial or possessing somewhat cylindrical pseudopods, with non-adhesive uroid (a region at the posterior of the cell which has a crumpled appearance).[1]

While the monophyly of Amoebozoa has yet to be established, current information confirms the status of Chaos and Amoeba as closely related taxa within the group. However, the same research raises questions about the monophyly of the genus Chaos, since Chaos nobile may be basal to a group containing Chaos carolinensis and at least two species of Amoeba[16] , as illustrated below, following Pawlowski and Burki (2009):
Chaos species are versatile heterotrophs, able to feed on bacteria, algae, other protists, and even small multicellular invertebrates.[3] Like all Amoebozoa, they take in food by phagocytosis, encircling food particles with its pseudopodia, then enclosing them within a food ball, or vacuole, where they are broken down by enzymes. The cell does not have a mouth or cytostome, nor is there any fixed site on the cell membrane at which phagocytosis normally occurs.

The cell's membrane, or plasmalemma, is extremely flexible, allowing the organism to change shape from one moment to the next. The cytoplasm within the membrane is conventionally described as having two parts: the internal fluid, or endoplasm, which contains loose granules and food vacuoles, as well as organelles such as nuclei and mitochondria; and a more viscous ectoplasm around the perimeter of the cell, which is relatively clear and contains no conspicuous granules. Like other lobose amoebae, Chaos move by extending pseudopodia. As a new pseudopod is extended, a variable zone of ectoplasm forms at the leading edge and a fountaining stream of endoplasm circulates within. The effort of describing these motions, and explaining how they result in the cell's forward movement, has generated a large body of scientific literature.

Until quite recently, the genus Chaos was included, along with all other protists that extend lobose pseudopods or move about by protoplasmic flow, in the phylum Sarcodina.[16] Molecular phylogenies based on the examination of ribosomal DNA, have shown that Sarcodina is a polyphyletic grouping: that some amoeboids shared a more recent common ancestor with members of other phyla than with other Sarcodina. Consequently, the amoeboids of Sarcodina have been distributed among two newly created supergroups, Rhizaria and Amoebozoa. Chaos and its close relative, Amoeba, are now placed in the latter, within the order Tubulinida: naked amoebas (lacking a test, or shell), either monopodial or possessing somewhat cylindrical pseudopods, with non-adhesive uroid (a region at the posterior of the cell which has a crumpled appearance).[1]

While the monophyly of Amoebozoa has yet to be established, current information confirms the status of Chaos and Amoeba as closely related taxa within the group. However, the same research raises questions about the monophyly of the genus Chaos, since Chaos nobile may be basal to a group containing Chaos carolinensis and at least two species of Amoeba[16] , as illustrated below, following Pawlowski and Burki (2009):

Chaos is a genus of amoebae, in the family Amoebidae. The largest and best-known species, the so-called "giant amoeba" (Chaos carolinense), can reach lengths of 5 mm, although most specimens fall between 1 and 3 mm.[2][3][4]

Members of the genus closely resemble Amoeba and share the same general morphology, producing numerous cylindrical pseudopods, each of which is rounded at the tip.[5] However, while Amoeba have a single nucleus, Chaos can have as many as a thousand. Because of this attribute, C. carolinensis was once placed in the genus Pelomyxa along with the other giant multinucleate amoeba, Pelomyxa palustris. Recently, molecular phylogenetic studies of this species have confirmed the view of some earlier researchers[6] that it is more closely related to Amoeba than to Pelomyxa.[7] The species is now placed in the independent genus Chaos, a sister group to Amoeba.

That's it it's running ALL TIME FOR YOU!
<@UDDE5960N> here's your testing
Alright.... that's new
LOL
cj you fucked up
Ohhhh right, I turned of the restriction on people!
Fixed it
Any time someone posts a message 15% it'll get contracted
Good morning!
Summon the silent
I mean these phrases are suppose to be dark and brooding
Wait you're not in Summon???
IT MUST BE SO!
The profile picture thing is bugging me. I think I'll fix it tonight
lol
Finally!
I might not finish though. I'm going to try to fix it in a way that gives everybody an imposter
Hmmmmm I wonder why drew triggered, also heheheheheheehe daka
something seems off about your bot
does it?
I need to figure out a way that if it doesn't do anything it should trigger
convert message, save to new string. if old string = new string return
I tried that it was being a jerk
Also, those aren't all proper contractions?
See if that works
There the primary ones on wikipedia
Fix't is a primary contraction on wikipedia?
it't-archaic, except in stock uses such as _<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Before_Christmas|'Twas the night before Christmas>_
did it just contract `it`
yeah
but it didn't save any character
doesn't that contraction have to come before?
just turned the i into a '
it saved a space
in some cases
` ` is a character too!
not in the case of 'twas
?
it was
Whoop's wrong location, it put in the right space now
still saves a space
oh
fair
I have add to the word before, add to the word after, and replace all together
It was in the before, and not the after
does that mean it could have changed `Whoop's wrong location, it put in the right space now` to `Whoop's wrong location, t`put in the right space now`
yes
will your bot ignore `it's`
't's
because if it just checks for it, it will mess up on on it's
It will probably mess up it's
wait no
It checks for `it`   not `it`
:noice:
Everyone is dying around me
I'm scared guys.......
<@UDD45P5A9> this is the wikipedia page I went off of
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_(grammar)>
Everyone is drying everyone is drying everyone is drying
There is like 0 chance the virus doesn't hit wayfair at some point
if that happens, I'm working from home indefinitely
:same: though I feel like I am at an especially high risk, as much of my apartment building is international students
I think there's a 0 chance someone isn't already infectious
Read it, but I still don't see how we would end up with contractions like fix't
As long as they aren't coughing you are probably fine. This shit hits your lungs apparently
We all take the t. We are all doomed
I don't
There was someone almost hacking up a lung
RUN
Ohhh cause I'm a dumbass
I had it in the wrong place within the code it's suppose to be 'tfix
Ahh makes sense
Also, is the code sophisticated enough to do double and triple contractions?
More like it's dumb enough to do it
I kinda want to stir panick in politics
copley community experience.
Something like
`Hey, there are a few people around me coughing up lungs, can we send them home`
someone escorted the poor girl out
wait really?
really
RIP all you in coply are infected
LOL!
Yea.....
wait, what. you in = y'in
yes
oh yeah i suppose
y'all
bingo
And here I was joking. Change it to:
`Hey, I just saw somebody escored out of the building after a serious coughing fit. Should I be concerned`
AND WATCH THE MASS PANIC UNFOLD
then get brenden to `@here :this:`
LOL!
actually, that is kind of a legit question... If I saw that, I'd probably wanna go home
<@UETS9HTSS> run!
<@UDDE5960N> did you actually see someone escorted out?
or is this just you spitballing about sewing chaos?
I was spitballing about sweing chaos, I think <@UDDE5960N> is legit
Define "escort"
As in someone was trying to hack up a lung, and someone else walked away with them while they were coughing
That kind of escort happened.... like an hour or 2 ago
where was this?
<@UDDE5960N>
Floor 1 tower 1
well that's not promising
Like.... 4ish rows away
time to hit star market and stock up on nonperishables before hiding in my apartment for awhile
I mean.... yea
```Hey, I just saw somebody escored out of the building after a serious coughing fit. Should I be concerned```
-&gt; copley community experience
actually, please do
:notme:
I don't know if they were escorted out of the building, just away from our space
And I don't like to ensue that kind of mass panick until I'm out of the kill zone
Thank you very much!
I can cause it if you'd like
Your choice, I'm just sharing my observations
because I like you people
It would mean less coming from brenden as he didn't actaully see it if people question him
I can watch and feed him info
Mostly because it's funny
<https://www.boston25news.com/news/first-positive-case-coronavirus-identified-massachusetts-health-officials-say/XRHSPKXIP5EBPOTBEDWPMF6CAA/>
Yes that's in politics
it's here and people who think otherwise are silly, it's just not tested it yet or wide spread
oh shit i didn't even see it
I mean pax happened too
yes and we were all there
she lives in Cohasset
which is only an hour commute to back bay
we are done for
I told you
It's here, it's just not documented
I think I might stop by star market on my way home as well. Stock up a bit more
ohhhh.... opps......
I'm soooo bored
want to play some TM?
after 3 sure, I have a meeting now and another in an hour
Coughing on every desk I can
What's everyone up to today?
Wow.... that's evil
Daka the bio terrorist
keyboards specifically
you monster
No mercy
those are so hard to clean
LOL!
clearly just need to dip it in acid at this point
What is happening why is the world burning
Aysh what you need to realize is that the world is always burning
are you saying....
we didnt start the fire?
Yes Aysh
I agree with this
Also everyone knows that the 20s are for plagues
but arent you 30?
badumtis
:ba-dum-tss:
And yes, so it's your time to die now, not mine
A sheep, a drum, and a snake fall off a cliff...ba-dumm-tsss
lol
Soooo bored again......
you want us to push more animals off cliffs?
That seems needlessly mean Aysh
We should push evil people off cliffs
what isf they push us back?
Shove harder aysh, SHOW NO MERCY!
Be like Disney, just throw the lemmings off a cliff, for science!
Confused, but also...for it?
Aperture science should always make you excited and confused
Thier songs are the best

Somebody just deployed a change that broke our code. Now im mad. No profile fix today!
Our code as in our bot or wayfair code?
Wayfair code
Yeet it out the window
Wish I could. The code is trash
Hahahahaha
:dumpster-fire:
I'm angry my friends
If I had the privilege I'd try to quit
We are splitting the team so that a girl who reports to me can her her own team. But she is now wanting to take the best engineers, wanting to work on the more exciting team (which was born from my idea and ground work)
And had gone and spoken to my manager, my skiplevel, my pm, all in the morning
Ummmm well now...
Why life not easy
Why
Did you find out when they said that's what's happening? Seems like shitty leadership
Because I've been supporting and being a proponent for her as her manager. Meanwhile my manager was doing a bad job, got fired, a director did my review and I went from a high performer to and underperformer in one cycle. My manager acknowledged it's an inaccurate review but no way will they give that to me in writing.
So basically I've had no support
Awwwww poor aysh!!! And your locked in cause of the visa
They haven't decided this is what is happening but they're asking me how flexible I am, how I can compromise etc when I've already been so short changed for months
Yes visa :pensive:
I should just move to Canada
It might be worth mentioning that you that way, and that while you want to see her succeed, this is likely setting you up for failure. Then outline a good distribution of engineers (50/50) and projects in your favor (70/30)
I'm going to attempt to do that and that's a much nice way of putting it that I was thinking
Mental note has been made
For some reason this kind of political bullshit comes easy
Comes easy to you?
Yea, don't ask me why
I'm generally terrible
Framing shit to get people to move my way, I do that decently
Ugh that other girl does that really well
And has already spoken to my manager and my skip level in one day
Well that's less framing and more full on backstabbing bitchery
While I'm like 'hi, pardon the interruption. May I please take some of your time and schedule a one on one? Feel free to say no! Sorry if I'm taking up too much of your time'
Be nice but firm
She's very smart and capable and I generally enjoy working with her. But Ive realized I have no one looking out for me and I've ignored looking out for myself
You is right
Yea, I was telling that to my direct. She needs to look out for herself as not all bosses will do the things I do
I am an adult who should know this already
My parents didn't raise me right. Yes, it's their fault!
How's your new role?
But talking to your skip about this a concerning amount of stuff
Fuck if I know completed day 5
:joy:
I put a meeting on my bosses calendar for the role above the one they gave me that's open. Otherwise I'll probably leave in the summer
Are you looking for positions elsewhere already?
Otherwise this is a boring :dumpster-fire:
Oh wait but use your paternity leave
Yea
I have like another 3ish months I need to be at wayfair
And thenb
Freedom!!!
There is no freedom, that's what I've learned
No why
Adulthood?
Parenthood???
No corporate bullshit any place you go you'll deal with that crap aysh
Clearly I can't escape parenthood or adulting anymore
You could escape parenthood, you'd just be a giant dick though
That's harder at bigger companies because they're generally in meetings all day long
Yea, we do
Yea smaller companies will have sporadic days of insanity, but I guarantee that aysh's skip only has days like that
Mei said I'm not allowed
Hahahaha
Yup and we suffer for all of it!
Example aysh
I haven't worked a big boy job for anything less than a fortune 500.... I'm not sure what I did wrong in life :(
Fancy! Maybe I should join
so its totally on me
ouch. seriously? could you not take action?
I'm with marissa on this one
They should be available for you
this one's on me. im gonna be better about demanding their time
:open_mouth:

No

Tada!
I hate lizards. Sorry daka
Soooo Biden came out on super tuesday, Warren is spoiling the progressive vote by splitting it when the moderates all united.
And odds are strong of a contested convention fun!
Muricaaah
Maybe also soon stop saying Trump won because no one likes Clinton because he's gonna best anyone else too
Exactly, so when he beats Biden no one will be able to continue that thread
I mean Dave's right Russia has already started targeting Biden, look at the impeachment campaign
Why the Democrats can't put up better choices is beyond me.  Where's the next obama? Why is everyone sooooo old.......
Also the fact that the young, who are bernie's largest backers, dont vote cuz fuck waiting in lines
Lol only because it's full of drama
if it were business as usual, i wouldn't care a bit
I saw somewhere recently that the young now outnumber the boomers
so any complaint that the old are ruining things for the young is pretty much moot now
I for one cannot fathom why anybody wouldn't excercise their right to vote
I'd argue that warren still being in the running probably tanked bernie in quite a few states
i just texted my cousins asking them wy they didnt vote
So you didn't appreciate the snake petting zoo after the layoffs?
daka- yes i get the trolling but i choose to ignore it
.......................................... i raised HELL
To be fair, the on the scale of things to vote for that seem to matter, voting for a democratic candidate nomination is pretty low.
aren't there also like restrictions on who can vote in the democratic primaries?
depends on the state. Mass is open
at least open if you're not registered with a party
they asked me which party ballot I wanted
Also fun fact I learned while renewing my license. By default getting a license registers you to vote. You must check a box that says "Dont use this info to register me to vote" if you don't want to register
Wait, why would you ever register for a party?
you might need it if you want to run? I'm not sure
you as in the average person, not anybody planning on running for any sort of office
there are more average people working with the parties than you'd think.
Get mail and shit
Your a Democrat/Republican you want to know what's going on
The parties need to just go away
both of 'em
Lol
Good luck with that
Sucks that it can't go away since it is the best way to get elected
also every democracy has political parties. Its just that some systems deal with them better than others. Our founders wanted to wish them away, so they didn't build around them well.
:clap: Ranked :clap: Choice :clap: Voting :clap:
^ instant-runoff ranked choice voting
^ Monarchy
quadratic voting.
Theocracy
I don't think he would best Bernie or Warren
Ooooh, so you're not registered with a party. Fun!
This. This 100%
Not really. Some dude just decided to bring in a bunch of lizards
Trial by combat is my vote
so for every law passed, we need to have a melee to the death to determine if it passes?
:panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2:
Doesn't have to be to death but yea
From the same team who was pretty much all out on monday
Anything notworthy in the All Company Meeting?
wasting time with operational updates
new method for answering questions in which they don't answer any and talk about the general topics the questions covered
ran out of time because of step 1
free lunch from chick-fil-a at the warehouse
people are annoyed at the vendor choice because they're anti-lgbqasdlkfja;dsljfl
etc
so business as usual
so a SNAFU
So, news news news news, but I think we all missed an important piece to start the day with. 
Happy birthday Brenden!
Bloomberg dropped out
I also now want a birthday bot that automates this and just says "Today is " &lt;chaos_monkey_member&gt; "birthday!"
I think flask can set up chron jobs. so wouldn't be too hard
Thank you!
I'm with brenden very.... awkward
/roll d20+2
I think business people like to inflate their value
Happy Birthday. 
That's because business people don't always have something tangible to prove their worth, so they find other means
Isn't chron pretty deep in the os? Not sure if we have a full VM or not.
and flask restarts constantly
Hm.     Maybe a problem. 
Mei you're not fat yet, but you are getting there
And that was the last they ever heard from CJ. 
<@UK7V13DS7> keep talking there was an issue with automatic chaos profile creation
Could always save birthdays in Mongo's user profiles
Working on a popup for user management. I'll include birthdays in that when I get around to it
CJ you suck
Say good bye to CJ for game night for a while
I want the ability to have Prometheus jump in without reacting to an event. 
I love you sweetie
I still get game night, it's called baby mommy bonding time
Ayy it worked. thanks <@UK7V13DS7>
It’s call CJ may not be alive the next day 
We released a new feature that might have small impact on our outsourced Product Question people.
This was released 8 minutes ago. We are receiving reports that the agents have been seeing the new change since monday... which is quite literally impossible
Good bye to dnd 
:lol: d&amp;d died ages go
Different group mei
There is the <#CGFSDDPTQ|bot_reminders> which was an old attempt to force an event on a given schedule based on the /remind command
It has been disabled for a while, but the capability is there
We also have the capability to force the prometheus user to run a slash command, so it is possible to have a special event trigger a reminder for a future event with metadata as the event text
<@UETS9HTSS> IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY SMASH :allthethings: !
:rip: i cannot find birthday bot. I guess it was deleted at some point
IT WAS!?!?!/
guess so. It's a pretty easy one to remake though
Booooo Doug must have deleted it, it use to live in the server.py
if nothing was calling it I may have removed it in the cleanup
?

<@UDC4QL95G>
why did my comment get deleted?
Hmmm? I was away form my desk. It was probably lost in the transfer from flame-mine to buttery-waxflower as it was a section of commented out code
my comment on this thread.
I said if the birthday code wasn't being called, I probably removed it in the code cleanup
and it instantly got deleted.
If I had to guess, it might be due to <@UDDE5960N> trying to open up the impersonation bot to all users, but you lacking an impersonation may have led to just the message being deleted
you should be immune to bots though
<@UDDE5960N> can you confirm?
Looks like there was no `IsFromChaosUser` check, so that was likely it
Dunno
Is that how the interaction works?
It would make sense that it would delete the message and not replace it if it can't post as doug
IT HAS BEEN MADE!!!!!
MUHAHAHAHAHAHA
What has been made?
Happy birthday bot
That is a different birthday bot than existed before.
The old bot threw :party:  on either side of every message
Better?
Cant tell
I’m bored
Someone else is doing my job
find a podcast or audiobook
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UDDE5960N>
does it happen every time?
but not in threads?
Apparently
three in a row
four?
five?
yep, all the time
It's slow due to the profile pic
are we waiting?
:notme:
Waiting?
waiting?

HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRENDEN
thank you!
could someone say the word "brenden" as a top level post
brenden
then the same thing for "birthday"
birthday
then try "happy birthday"
happy birthday
lastly "happy birthday brenden"
trying to figure out why it triggered on aysh
happy birthday brenden
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRENDEN
hmmm
aysh causes special chaos
looking at code, it really shouldn't have been possible...
weird
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRENDEN
current code. CJ might have edited it before you took a look
True. Too lazy to check the commit history
I have been out of box for the last hour
This was fun to read through
<@UDDE5960N> how did this happen
I don't know!!!!
:magic:
FIX IT
Brenden probably just hit the url manually
hes trolling us
It should be only top level post from the user it was literal copasta from Fire/Box
I did no such thing
Someone else may have, but it was not me
Rumors of Valve VR headset back in stock on monday in limited quantities.
Fancy
Also highly likely I'll leave, my lack of sales ops experience will hold me back
was that dejavu or cj talking
me!
Woh
Woah what?
just
Woh
lol
I thought you weren't leaving till summer
Well yea
FYI the dive button causes massive issues
Thats cuz I repurposed it for `/cast` and `/chaos`
Turned off quicktime for you
uhhh ok
<@UEA7LHFQS> Where the fuck are you going!?!?!? (For those not in the know today is ben's last day)
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
NOOooooooOOOOOOoooooOOOOoooooOOOOO
Just saw the email
That makes 7 former employees in the channel
I only count 6
Ben, Victoria, Dave, Drew, Tyler. Chris
Ben, Chris, Dave, Drew, Tyler, Victoria, Richard
Ahhh right
Woah, didn't know. Hope he starts responding in this slack so we can still hang out with him!
He said he would and that he has a copy of root he wants to play
Nice, I'll give it a second shot and read all the rules so I can explain every class to people more succinctly
HAHAHAHAHAHA
That's the problem
You can't cause everyone does something different
No but that's just it, that should be part of the rules explantation
I have it figured out
I mean the succinctly explain shit
That's what I mean. It doesn't hurt to walk everyone through every class so they know what the hell is going on
you all are sneaky
thanks for clank :thumbsup:
I'm assuming CJ dropped it off?
Aysh?
I did!
It was a real strugle
Super Awkward, my boss grabbed on the way out to meet drew, so then I had to sit through a meeting with it
:lol: I cropped that part out
Yea this whole interaction was super awkward for me
Was it though?
I suppose it is a new manager, but did his team members give you crap?
they probably weren't even there
Well they asked questions and shit
your's weren't mine were
oh
that makes more sense
Live and learn and move on
We played it at PAX to test it out before we gave it to you. Fun game, definitely would play again
I doubt much more than Bloomberg did Biden - it's kinda grasping at straws there tho. If he was as great as Reddit/his diehards want us to believe, Warren shouldn't have mattered
So many....
Good Morning!
Summon the silent
Good Morning <@UPGVCMGD9> ]
GOOD MORNING DOES PEOPLE HAVE ANY WEEKEND PLANS?
Wait where did my intense giphy go
Good morning monkeys
Oink oink
and you little piggie
do people have opinions on Minneapolis?
has anyone been there?
<@UDDE5960N> it's not my birthday anymore :big-mad:
Also <@UDC4QL95G>
fixed
test
lgtm
thanks daka
Sorry forgot to turn it off
It would be awesome to figure out how to use dates with prometheus
No and No <@UK7V13DS7> can probably tell you about the airport though
CJ, you're getting married soon; you can't date prometheus!
meh, don't particularly care about the airport
I only ask because it looks like an interesting weekend trip
Mei is also likely to have an opinion on that, she's a travel geek.  Downside is you guys travel for different things with limited overlap
food is good overlap
did I ever show you how I plan for travel?
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yaB2By22lXF5PNtQwUtPTiVXesw&amp;usp=sharing>
yeah, Twins suck.
ok, I don't have helpful opinions
My planning involves getting up in the morning and being like What sounds good to me?
I tend to plan the travel, the lodging, then stop
unless there is music involved
I don't plan out what I'll be doing, but like to know what interested me in the area I'm currently in
Music?
well, concerts are rather static
and tend to require tickets
to be fair, I didn't specify helpful opinions
That's just an interesting expection, implying that doug only travels for music and no other type of static event (conferences/Cons/sports)
it's what he implied IMO
or not necessarily _only_, but mostly
I was just saying it's interesting
Brenden :heart_sob: thats beautiful
the map?
thanks

Oh jesus, non work politics just strayed into the American Civil war, and it's getting feisty
i love it
and may have helped instigate
I don't travel *for* music, but if I'm going somewhere with good music I will move dates a bit for it.
Anyone who thinks anything less than all out war for secession is a fool
Interesting, thanks doug!
holy god their literally insane
The midwest would never join New England
I mean New York is much more aligned with New England, and New England is pretty aligned with itself from a beliefs standpoint
This is more about beliefs than like actual teaming up to murder your neighbor doug.  I would say that the great lake states have similar views as I
I think most of illinois will fall into the midlands rather than Greater Appalachia
The UP, most of Wisconsin, and all of Minnesota are more aligned with Canada than New England philosohpically.
<@UDDE5960N> I'm talking beliefs
I'm from Michigan, was there this week
its sooooo far for NE
And you think that Canadian beliefs and New England Beliefs are different
yeah
chicago is also in yankeedom in this map. seems weird
I'm curious why, but also realize I don't have a good understanding
Canada is liberal, sure, but its also super rural
it has a wide open space mentality.
sounds like michigan
people are quiet, keep to themselves
Well yea that's doug's point, but i don't see how that differs from NE
hate the loud NE way of doing things
NE is so crowded...
Soooo population density is the difference?
NE you assert your 'rights' loudly to others, Michigan you just leave and go into the woods
The differences between Grand Rapids and Boston are so thick
Interesting, I'm not saying the guys right
I'm just saying there are definite regional ideals that clash
Michigan is where you go when you dont' want to deal with shit anymore and just live out the rest of your life. I can see maine being like that
I see Vermont as closer
well, maybe Vermont goes with Wisconsin
New Hampshire?
they both are oddly socialist
Main, NH, and Vermont are all the same to me.
But I would still say we're all idealogical aligned
Maine NH and Vermont don't have ideals. Kinda like Michigan. They simply exist
people in Michigan make fun of the East Coast as elitist.
and broken government
I mean they do, New Hampshire has "Live free or Die" as their state mantra
Also the east coast elitist/broken government would be the Tide water area
you say that like people in the Great Lake States see anything except NYC and Boston
and Philly
ehhhhhh........
lol
This is how I see it:
Maine, NH, VT are all the same. New york city is the entire state, Penn and Mass have a big city each, Road island is a single city, and DC exists cuz the president.
North and South Carolina and Georgia are pretty, and Florida is full of crazy people. Any states left out are also Maine
Cj why do all of your bots get rid of capitalization
Cause I use lower in order to do replace
As a former yinzer, I will assume that when you say "penn has one big city" you are referring to Pittsburgh. :stuck_out_tongue:
I'll take a look. this sounds solvable
It probably is, I'm just lazy and it works
I feel like Dakota is representative of the general populace in this channel
DAKA FOR PRESIDENT!
Nope. Philly :lol:
lol
I feel like Dakota is representative of the general populace in this channel
Nonwork politics is on a tear today, I don't know what lit a fire under their asses, but they're busy
lol
warren dropped out
that certainly helped
A little too late
not what I meant
I meant it helped stir up #nonwork-politics
Ohhhhh
Yea but that was only a small part of today's convo
ok, its not all the way, because natural language processing is insanely hard, but it should do a better job respecting capital letters now.
i like warren because she looks like my favorite paternal aunt
She visited WF before the race started. I was very impressed by her in person. 
I want bernie to win so I can watch the country explode
but not literally
are we not panicking enough?
Apparetnly CA has a state of emergency for covid?
SoE in this case probably just means they can divert more money to the issue. Its a dramatic term, but I'd guess should not inspire panic
huh
oh
anyone interested in skiing this saturday?
loon?
State of Emergency can vary in severity, example hurricanes or earthquakes that hit a particular location
transportation+lift ticket for $69
Aysh panick is when you hear about enforced curfews
lol
Week, and by default weekend, in Paris
Or just never panic. Take care of your self, start working remotely when you hear of cases in Boston, buy a week’s worth of non perishable food. 
Need more than just a week! 2 weeks is red cross recommended
I mean to start. You don’t have to go crazy with shopping. Build a pantry a bit at a time. 
I got fatter...........
That seems really efficient and organized!
Thanks!
state of emergency is very misleading. its all about those funds going to fixing the issue otherwise cant divert the funds :stuck_out_tongue:
oh america
Brb moving to canada where i'm less likely to be nuked
./chaos admin
66% of the population live close to the US border (within 100 km)
pretty sure that would mean you would get caught in the after effects
but there are already cases on boston
In
I didn't know that.
what? happened weeks ago- and then some in rhode island
I heard about the Rhode Island one
Well, I haven't heard of people self-isolating yet. But I am bringing my laptop home every night starting now.
is Mass poor?
I don't think so
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_income>
by median income, Mass is 5th in the country
Median household income for the state in 2018 was $79,835
Depends on what you mean by poor too Aysh, this sounds like income per capita, but you could be referring to how much tax a state brings in

Looks like the one Aysh and I thinking about is the Feb 1st Umass infection
I somehow doubt we would have ever used that one anyway
ah. community spread is the key. We don't have that yet
Although there's been an new infection as of the 3 days ago
:you-mean-the-chaos-emeralds:
Who's suppose to be in the middle?
I mean trump is telling people to go to work sick, so we are screwed no matter what
middle?
it's niraj
In the middle of the chaos emeralds is face
I'm not sure who's
<@UHQD9J1SL> no one is going to provide you with soap it keeps getting stolen
WHO STEALS SOAP
Everyone there's a plague going on!
but soap isnt portable- i can see that applying to hand sanitizer but not liquid hand soap
HAHAHAHAHA
Nah, that's just a logistical problem
Silly naive Aysh, I just make it portable to my house!
Just use the empty hand sanitizer bottles
Needs profile picture
Well clearly doug is feeling evil
Does this mean we get to thread on him?!!?!?
:lol: I would have put money on it being you not doug
Nope
profile picture is coming tomorrow
ya but someone will need to refill them and all
booooooo
:nicee:
the emote I wanted wasn't on slack yet
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I DONT LIKE IT
STOP IT
\
Contraction junction?
yes :cry:
I GET HEEBIE JEEBIES NOOOOOO
This response made the bot great
Yes but what I'm saying Aysh is that you can always just steal a new bottle of soap when the old one runs out
Yes but what I'm saying Aysh is that you can always just steal a new bottle of soap when the old one runs out
Soap/sanitizer hot commodities right now, right after Masks
I gotta say that the bot did work out better than I initially thought it would
Yes but what I'm saying Aysh is that you can always just steal a new bottle of soap when the old one runs out
ok, I need to fix trailing spaces
Yea I was gonna say I can't read the regex enough to figure out wtf is going on
<https://www.boston.com/news/health/2020/03/05/tennessee-man-coronavirus-boston-logan>
Yea it's kinda amusing I like it better at 5% than 15% though
We're all gonna die
xposted that to nonwork bos
Wayfair
woot woot
Which is why we don't have soap
Turns out the first case was a University of Mass student :lol:
ok but where am i going to steal it FROM?
make it scale based on the number of changes :lol:
That would mean making it run every time and then determine if it will post
we don't have the bots do that right now
wouldn't be hard to code. but looping through string replacement is not very performant
:disappointed: \
Could hack it with a char count difference
O(n)
you still have to loop to make the replacements.
the difference part is easy
Nah I mean just char count at the end after the current method
On average only 1-2 chars are subtracted
after the regex has already happened?
so if you are missing 6 characters, then total you likely have 3-6 abbreviations
yeah
that's already after the slow part.
Well we are already doing the slow part
only 1 in 20 times
ah good point
Which last name is harder to read

Raajasekar

OR

Zafiropoulos
even though Raajasekar is easier to read
I'm nore familiar with the way greeks say things, so I'd be more confident saying Zafiropoulos
I _might_ attempt to pronounce Zafiropoulos, I wouldn't attempt Raajasekar
I tend to read without trying to pronounce words. I guess it depends how verbally you read
for reference - Raj (as in every brown person on every sitcom ever)- a (as in a/an/the) - shaker :salt-shaker:
I'm trying to think if I've ever heard you say your last name
probs not
I hate names... they are too hard. Everybody should just go by "Hey you"
I know I haven't
I'll have to remember to ask next itme I see you
the third-person bot should be easier to make respect capital letters. I'll probably do it over lunch tomorrow
today is taking forever
it's awfu
:iagree:
I'm done with work for this sprint
and don't want to pick up something new
Ohhhhh my days are crazy busy right now for some reason
Yea Daka you want to take it from 1 in 20 to 1 in1
Wait so won't tomorrow be terrible for you Brenden?
I did that college for 4 years to everyone lol
tomorrow is day 1 of next sprint
and we'll be in jira
Your sprints start on fridays
That seems terrible
nah, we do sprint planning on fridays
so we review tickets we'll be working on
determine if they're properly estimated
and decide if we want to commit to that amount of work for the sprint
or if we need less/more
we try to identify dependencies and complexities on that first day
That feels like a lot of thinking for a friday
I'm still against this

Sorry you have a pregnant wife to deal with, roll with disadvantage
Fuck that, it's physics if anything i should get to roll with advantage
Orrrr expertise!
Physics to avoid means running away somehow
your wife being pregnant isn't gonna help you avoid anything
Exactly, I don't need her help this is building like a log swing or an effective barrier
Mei helping me would impose disadvantage cause I'd have to fix all the shit she breaks
The system already calls disadvantage. 
Hey <@UETS9HTSS>/<@UDL020K8D> why do you think people like the variant ranger so much?
Because normal ranger sucks. 
Well I get that, but why is variant better than Revised?
```The Tennessean on Thursday reported that the man is 44 years old and officials have been told that he "may have caught the virus at an out-of-state conference which was also attended by people who had traveled outside of the country."```
:uhoh: :panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2:
I don’t know the difference between variant and revised 
Ahhhh ok
It's different
Trump and his team are just concerned about money and the economy pressing on at any cost
I don't know about better
Other than for beast master and tanking
Are you going to rebuild forkai?
Already did
Doesn't it remove some of the constraints that Hunter's mark has on hunters?
Ohhhhh fancy
If you take that feature
My wis score isn't very high though
So not many uses
Why did you choose variant over revised then?
Oh I want the rogue aim feature
Wheels are gonna fall off this bus in a scary way
Bonus action for advantage?
Hell yeah
If I didn't rebuild, I could use anything in the doc
????
Revised rangers were banned from using that content
Ohhhhh yea
So I needed to rebuild to use the doc
<@UDL020K8D> looks like you can make the title a link that doesn't expand via markdown:
<https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting>
maybe
You either had to be revised or variant no mixing
Masks don't do shit if you're healthy and not a healthcare professional! Drives me fucking nuts.
This is why I had no problem going to Paris still: I'm likely to catch it being in Boston
You could literally be infected from pax....
And brought it to Paris
If you do get sick, I wonder if they will let you back in the country
For the US totally
And let him walk around unsupervised
Because that's what this adminstration does
Hell they might even pay for the flight
/roll d20
Pax happened in Prudentialg. Half of us and of wayfair went for it. A covid case has been reported in someone who was at 'a conference in Boston ' at the same time as pax.
Three cases reported in people who all traveled for work to Cambridge.

This is right?
Dunno
Pax was not in the pru. It was at the Boston convention center
Though the three people in cambrage appears true
Gotcha. Want to be accurate when I scare my family :joy:
And panic
Don’t panic. 
Ok so person on train in front of me is talking to himself
And throwing stuff
What should I do?
Stop that!
If it bugs you I can turn it off for you when o get home. 
Move away slowly maintain sight but not eye contact
What if person gets aggravated and acts out more!
Make sure to position others between you
The driver of my train was chasing this guy out of the car today. If kept poking his head in from the other car each stop and getting chased out.

Good morning :sun_with_face:!
Wait, aren't you in baguette land?
Good Morning, yea so it's afternoon for him
I have a curse... I'm waking up earlier now that I'm unemployed. I don't know why
HAHAHAHAH
No job to dread coming into
All that weight lifted off your shoulders
Going to bed ealier?
Good morning lovelies. Its bright and sunny today. Don't you just hate it?
Who's in baguette land?
Drew Paris
Are you mad at the sun?
It hurts my eyes
True. But maybe it’s an opportunity to wear a big hat? Just dress up as Carmen Sandiego. 
Ah. Spitting resemblance
Just avoid the temptation to steal world monuments. 
Drew is infecting france with the :beer::coronavirus2:
Oh fun...
Well if you're going to go out, go out with french food and wine
The man's got balls. International travel during a global pandemic
When do you get back Drew? Will we know if you're a carrier by the 27th :joy:
What's the point of life then?
Don't listen to him! Be the best thief you can be!
Ok, I’ve been overruled. Clearly this one sunny day is your gateway into ultra-crime. 
I NEED AUTOGRAPHS!!! AND ONLY ME!!!!
Huh well this is odd. I seem to have woken up with a minor cough
:lol:
Dont worry im :wfh:
And thus you should stay there for a long time
at least until I stop coughing
Nope longer
Though I will note that this really isn't odd. This feels exactly like the kind of cough I usually get from allergies.
Stay away from me 
Can everyone help me collect 25 corks? Need it for the wedding hahaha.
I don't drink so I don't get access to any corks.
That sounds like a job for Marg Mei
I don't think I have every bought any alcohol that had a cork
I just need a total of 25 corks
CJ go ask Marj
GOD DAMN THE BOTS DELETING GIPHIES THIS IS HOW I COMMUNICATE!
the bots shouldn't be able to delete giphy
It showed up
Just add a fromBot check to the bot. 
CJ is just impatient
Already asked because if I waited for you it would be 10 years later :stuck_out_tongue:
I had a little girl Giphy, the muppet is just as good
How's the interviews process?
lol
Uh huh.....
I added a bot check to four bots. It should exist on all deletion bots now. I could add a default don't kill giphy flag to the delete operation
apparently not...

I'm always a little proud when I see people recommend/mention channels I created
Especially when they do it to me
context is that we received bagels without contact information as to who they're intended for
<@UHQD9J1SL> what's an `investion `?
its an effort you have invested your time in
does Brenden not know how to use threads?
:pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis:
So today I learned that when you add chlorine to a pool, the pool water will not actually smell like chlorine. Only after somebody pees in it will you get the classic pool smell.

Additionally, chlorine does not hurt your eyes or turn them red. It is instead the chemical created when the chlorine mixes with pee.
I want to :doubt:
hm, have to figure out what to do with the contractions at the beginning of the sentance
I have doubt now
google indicated that it's not just pee
body oil will also react
so high volume pools smell because of the number of people potentially
yeah sweat also has the same chemical.
That doesn't really make it better. Point is, the water doesn't smell until the person sweats/pees in it
makes it much better
I assumed there would be sweat and oil and stuff
Didn't necessarily assume there would be pee
That doesn't really make it better. Point is, the water doesn't smell until the person sweats/pees in it
Sweaty old men
and young men
and women
Uhhh first, pee is sterile. Second, the chemical that is reactin is Urea, which you pee and sweat out
and everyone else that went in the pool
You guys are having a weird convo today
See, now the emote is there. 
lol
I may get fired. I got mad at a client
Appearently not
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
when you got mad; what did you say/do?
your not suppose to be doing stuff
hmm?
her replacement is supposed to be doing stuff
Mei, we love you
Well too bad because my replacement doesn’t know how to handle the dumb clients yet 
Thanks Ayshu

MOMMY! people are being anti-social elements!
Elements?
In the legal sphere, the term '*anti*-*social elements*' represents a loose legal designation for persons who are deemed habitually to commit, or attempt to commit, or abet the com- mission of, a wide range of offences. It may also be used to denote people reputed to be desperate and dangerous to the community.
TIL that its an asian/ indian thing
? element in that context is pretty standard english
&gt; a group of people of a particular kind within a larger group or organization.
&gt; "extreme right-wing elements in the army"
^ one of the definitions of element
I mean I get what she's going for I've just never seen it in that context
that seems surprising
Yes but that's not antisocial, I agree with the definition above its military "elements "
Not delinquents
&gt;  There are certain unstable elements in the board game group
^ example
I think "criminal elements" is used quite commonly
cj when we say they're being elements, we're saying they're salty
salt isn't elemental. its a combination of earth and fire.
man here i am again wanting to buy a bunch of wayfair stock...
wanna buy mine?
trading window open for 1 more hour...
i'll hold off, but im gonna regret it
why are you buying? Isn't it sinking?
yup it's super low right now
I think it's gonna bounce back
thats true of about everything ,right?
Probably sleeping better. Less stress
I get back on the 11th, so we have time.
While I appreciate the compliment, it's hard to feel like it's me having any kind of bravery when I truly feel like this is the world overreacting like it has for the last 20 or so "pandemics."
<@UETS9HTSS> when I think element I think active, when I think anti-social I think passive
You want anarchy elements sure, but i won't have neet elements
why not?
cause neet's are passive, they hide
passive/active isn't part of the definition
you've tacked that on
`a group of people of a particular kind within a larger group or organization.`
that definition would include neets
I have no idea what this conversation is about
I'm more so saying that when I think of elements it's generally used in an active tone.  `People being anti-social elements` sounds passive.
Just because that's what you think of when you hear the word, doesn't make it actually part of the definition
what are neets?
Not a problem. I'll just bring them from the bar.
enjoy your ignorance
then why did you thread this on my comment?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I can also help with this very easily
Work at a bar, we get a lot of corks, I'll just get bartenders to help me collect them like they were doing for someone else before.
because we were discussing elements but I got dragged into meetings
and Aysh's use of anti-social elements
I'm not saying the definition is wrong, i'm just saying that when people define something as an element generally it is somehow active
As to neets, I agree with brenden if you don't get the reference you're probably better off as a person
It's totally Vitamin C. They are that size and shape.
so I discovered this evening that court tennis is a thing and it looks kind of interesting
? Isn’t all tennis played on a court?
nah, this is the origin sport of tennis/racquetball
played in a court reminiscent of a palace courtyard
I’d not heard of that. 
the serve must go on to the slanted roof and land in the back left corner
So are you playing off of awnings on market stalls?
the serve definitely is; I'm still not too solid on all the rules
there's apparently a court near my house
at like 939 boylston
some old fancy racquet club
might see if they'll teach my team for a pod outing
no idea if that would be feasible within the pod outing budget though
I was re-writing this bot. I might have messed up the regex. Extra spaces in the replacement. 
How big is your team?
no idea; I saw a short youtube video on it explaining the origins and a few basic rules
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCqxOzKNFks>
You don’t know how big your team is?
<https://imgur.com/mYs6e2c>
nope, wasn't a super informative video
oh!
my team at work
we're 4 people, possibly 5 depending on who you count
Ok, I was thinking a two on two game could be weird if your team was bigger than 4. 
<https://www.reddit.com/r/theocho> is a deep rabbit hole
You know there are places in Europe that do city-wide firework battles every year?
<https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nkI4Iqm-1Wg|https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nkI4Iqm-1Wg>
that feels more like spray and pray
this seems more targeted
That clip is more that way. But the holiday itself is less spray. Usually you hit if your side hits a bell more times. 
idk, seems more fun to shoot your close friends wearing bath robes with roman candles
I’m just pointing out the firework nonsense is not particularly an American thing. 
definitely
in fact, we regulate it too much
way back on a vacation in aruba, we (younger children) bought what amounted to half sticks of dynamite out of a shipping crate and blew stuff up on the beach
plus mortars, full sized fireworks, etc
but the latter ones were more expensive
melted my fingerprint off on a finger for a few years
Fireworks are useless and just ruin the air and kill hundreds every year and should be banned
BLASPHEMY!!!!!!!
I wish I could begin to explain Deepavali in India :joy:
I mean, I have incredible memories though

Thanks Drew!!
<@UETS9HTSS> Never seen a mushroom shaped cork.......
<@UDC03KCGK> Can you get me about 25-30 corks just in case we mess up hahaha
<@UDC03KCGK> make sure to try some Trappist beer. Some of those do not import to the US at all, but can be found in some Belgian taps. 
Yea that whole convo was great
Do you need us to bring you some?
25-30 is easy
I wore my winter coat into the office today. didn't check what the weather would be. quite the mistake.
:big-oof-bidoof:
I grabbed mine, looked at the weather (50-70) and grabbed my paper thin jacket
I travel with the same jacket between 20-70 degress
Sooooo I just ignore the weather
CJ is weird. But I also travel with the same jacket :slightly_smiling_face:
I will never say no to dark Belgium chocolate
Lol
Way to sound just as crazy as me Mei
This is why we are getting marry
Unfortunately not at the taps we were at. They had a couple Quads and a Dubel so we got those. Might try to find a trappist beer at a liquor store and drink ur back in France
Guys, we found Belgian chocolate covered macarons. We hit the bonus square in Belgian bingo!
You being crazy is not why we're getting married

we can get those in blue bootle

Little baby Nava :heart:
Lol it's already too late. If I were in the age group that were likely to be affected severly by the flu, i'd already be working from home
Aysh is just going to will that name into happening. 
lol
thats what im gooing to call her
soooo basically you're accepting that you'll get it to keep up social norms
Are you the kind of person who already has a list of baby names picked out for themselves?
what do you mean? i had a lot of names when i was a baby
also- lol no
Lol I'm not sure why so many people are freaking out about it. Its only really bad for the elderly. For most people it's a normal flu
If i get it, I get it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
St Paddy’s Day parade cancelled. 
Haha, but looks like you did know what I meant. :p
Wait, how many names did you have as a baby?
Aysh is gonna go on a baby naming rampage
It has killed people like us, IT HAS THE CAPABILITY!!!!!
That's why people are freaking out like numb nuts
I think it is _marginally_ more deadly to the non-immunocompromized, elderly, or extremely young.
In your head, are you pronouncing this like Nah-va or Nav-a? I guess it’s a hard A or a soft A. 
Seeing as I don't come into contact with the elderly or extremely young, i'm not gonna freak out about it.
I'm just saying, the amount of it killed this one perfectly healthy person news I've seen is kinda wierd
The news makes money off of stories. They are stretching to make headlines

Harvard can sustain a little bit of the hit, and they can still charge students full price
They are moving all classes to full online
yea but it's not the same experience
CJ have a list of nicknames he want to call the baby....
Haven’t killed extremely young ppl yet
That you won't let me use ANY OF THEM!
i wasnt names till i was 6 months old so my family just experimented a tonne
Send in the children brigade they're only hope
Nah-va like the Navajo (?) tribe
Interesting
There's a show with that as a premise only the adults die, children are immune
Soooo they basically treated you like a dog to see which name you responded to?
That's hardcore
Any good interview or job opportunity
really? Is that a traditional thing? just experimenting with names for a while? Honestly, it sounds like a good idea. I don't get how you are supposed to pick a permanent name for someone. and clearly the baby won't notice
I ate it
CJ doesn’t care about food as much as I do
Of course you would, you're willing to die for food.  I'm not willing to suffer for sustenance!
You f—-Ed up on macaroons and crepes in France
sort of- so we have a naming ceremony a few weeks in, and give babies 3 names (Usually a family name of a grandparents name or something)
there is somethign cute involved like whispering the names into the baby's ear or something .
Birth certificate only says 'baby' or something :smile:
I hate virtual classes
I liked my classes that released the virtual lectures to all the students in the class
but they usually dont officially call the babies those names because names ger outdated i suppose? i dont know
If I didn't feel like attending, I could just watch the lecture later at 2x speed
I recovered on the macaroons at De Gual, but yes we need to do crepes, can't we just count the Japanese ones?
BabyA, BabyB
I was a bit unique - i dont think anyone i know had as many potential names as I did.  They wanted the perfect name for their perfect baby girl you see :heart:
Oh, I thought that you meant that the liege were the puffy ones (more similar to American ones), I just misunderstood what you meant by "fluffy" for liege. Those are the best tho
And you learn half as much
is there a particular meaning to your name?
Yes- it has been discussed before in this slack but I love myself so i might as well
Western names don't actually ever mean anything. I'm just named for both my grandfathers
I think most asian names have double meaning
Based on my birthday date/ month I should have been names something that starts in 'sa'  (And some other syllables)
So they tried a bunch before landing on this one
Ayshwarya is a name of the Goddess Lakshmi- she's the Goddess of all forms of wealth
including Wisdom/ Money/ food/ cattle/ Bravery/ Fertility - just al of it
So basically I OWN EVERYTHING
hm, I'm thinking how this would have gone for me when I lived in the dorms. I probably wouldn't have brought my school laptop home, so that'd be annoying, using the family's desktop. I would have needed a ton of books, but Amazon would be able to fix that for me. biggest problem would be that I wouldn't have considered home to be a study/work space. my productivity would have plummeted
also my name is VERY common in my generation. Its like Dave :stuck_out_tongue:
oh, you're right, we have talked about this. sorry!!! :stuck_out_tongue:
THERE'S MORE AYSHS?!!?!?!?
I CAN"T HANDLE MORE THAN 1!
Aysh = Dave. Its canon now
The nature of online lectures are very different as well. I liked the recordings because it was literally a recording of the teacher giving the lecture in teh classroom, with a separate screen capture of the board, so there was no difference between sitting in the class and watching it afterward. If It had been online only, I would not have been happy
All of my classes were also 100+ student lectures, so being in the classroom meant squat
a couple of my smaller classes could be like 70% discussion. The prof was there to get the class to talk stuff out. Those classes would have to change entirely
Wait wait, roll this back, the Bravery is considered a source of wealth?
YES you can have a 'wealth of' anythign right?
In Western culture, traditionally yes. Used to be the brave people won battles and battles were a legit source of income
:finger_up:
:finger_down:
Not counting random bullshit classes I took for the random credits i needed, I think I had only like 3 classes total that were small classrooms. Most of my classes were formateed with 2/3 huge lectures, and then 1-2 small "classroom" sessions where we basically did worksheets. These were run by TAs
I had one discussion based class: Ethics. I hated it because it was 8:30 in the morning
Not everything ties back to actual Money!
My graduating class was 7 people, 2 of which were BAs so they got to skip out on some of classes
what school did you go to?
All of our classes in my major were small classroom session
URI
My degree's graduating class, I graduated with 1000 other people
&gt; It has a total undergraduate enrollment of 13,865
how was your class 7?
Because no in their right mind does straight phyics
Wait.... My college did 1000 people, we graduated more.... that was a miserable day
what channel is that?
I didn't go to my graduation.
Its a private channel. not sure what channel she is referring to though
I knew it'd be miserable
:open_mouth:
The parent channels
working-parents/erg-caregivers
My mom would have been mortified if I had skipped graduation
In fact I argued and lost that fight
I mean, my mom sure was
Only reason I went. I don't care one bit for the ceremony
I told her she could go to the ceremony still if she wanted
The MBA ceremony was much better because it was only graduate students
It's pointless if she doesn't get to see her little Dougie walk across the stage!
Its all about the pictures
well, doesn't matter. I still won that one
I'm still mad I was forced into the high school graduation. Hottest day of the summer, in robes, for both mass in the cathedral, then the long ceremony itself. so awful.
I didn't mind my HS one, because it was fun to be together with everyone
My HS one was over 3 days, because Catholic traditions needed to be spread out or other BSA. The admin also threatened to not let us graduate if we didn't participate, my whole 55 person class wanted to not do it
I guess your school was more Catholic than mind. We fit mass and graduation into a single day
WTF IS THIS LEVEL OF EVIL!?!?!!?
That’s stupid
This is beyond stupid Mei, this is straight evil
Somebody behind me just coughed once. TIME TO PANIC
I'm WFH
:panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2:
Well we had practice one day, then the mass, then the graduation
Wait wait what?!?!?
You had "practices"??????
One of my favorite hiking spots growing up was on fire recently
Uhhhhhh what's on fire in march????
We had graduation practice in HS as well
whats the reverse of caregiver? (Not care taker) but like someone you take care of, but not a dependent necessarliy
:disappointed:
patient
Man that' serious fire that big this early in the year
I mean, It was like 70 degrees out
Care takee, invalid, old person, baby
people were probably hiking
and probably set a fire up there
and it probably got out of hand
that place gets packed when the weather gets nice
cars lining the road for like half a mile
Still, this is a little early in the year for shit to catch fire
not if it was human caused
takeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
thats really sad Brenden
Even human caused it's still early
I mean generally the ground is cold, the trees are moist, i mean this is basically saying that it's as dry as the middle of summer
several vehicles were destroyed, but everyone got off the mountain safely
Well there hasn't been any rain/snow recently right?
Unless we're saying someone with accelerant was intentionally setting fire
things are probably pretty dry
someone probably started a campfire
and it caught something else
and i'm not sure cold ground actually affects the spread of fire
I mean I get what you're saying brenden
I'm saying that conditions for this to get this out of control in winter is concerning
hasn't been much snow, so things weren't wet
ward?
practice????
actually, now that I'm thinking about it, we had that too
and that was a different day
ah- DING DING DING
Why?
People begging for money?
<https://giphy.com/gifs/the-simpsons-fire-homer-simpson-vLruErVSYGx8s>
sometime back this person sent an email saying they dropped a $10 note and saying it was required for them to survive or eat or soemthing and then people 'returned' it and they said thanks
i thought 'oh sad- i might have just given them $10 if i saw that email'
there was a person asking for money on the train this morning with their baby. it was heartbreaking.
I find begging for money (for yourself) from your coworkers very unprofessional
It's one thing if your daughter has cancer and you want to raise money or something
```
 I'm located at the Ogden Call Center, I dropped a $10 bill that was given to me by another agent because they love me.. i'm super poor right now and one bad accident away from poverty lol so if you found/picked up this money would you kindly return it to me :) ```

Begging for money in general is a demeaning task that only the desperate should take
```Wayfair has some awesome and honest employees :)```
but "I got a car that I can't afford, help me pay for it please" rubs me the wrong way
I agree. but there are a lot of points in our system that puts people in very hard situations. even when they are working. I have to imagine these people also feel the distaste of it.
the one aysh mentioned didn't bother me
as the person lost something
lol
I'm WFH today
and just got mandated to WFH tomorrow
as a "test day"
yeah it didnt bother me either
wait are yo usick? or are they testing VPN stuff
nah, I'm not sick
ah, now that bot looks like its working well.
Yup, you make sure you know how to line up, how to walk in, what to do when you walk in and during all the sections of the graduation
I just remember it as a day for the vice-principal to get reminded how everyone's last name was pronounced
We had to put the phonetics on our index card
Did you miss the earlier email? There's a sob story about how she was hit by someone who stole a car totaled hers, and all the insurance companies said we don't cover criminal incidents
Ahh, I didn't see that
With that context, it doesn't annoy me nearly as much
lol
I think it might be time to start investing in the market
Yea, I mean there's probably more poor decision making, but it seems like she tries.  These are the people I wish our government would try to help
yeah my brother made me put a bunch of my savings into vanguard stuff last week
just put a limit order for vanguard s&amp;p 500
I'll probably give it another week or 2
Really let the pandemic hit a fever pitch
oh I'm not all in
I'll be doing this a bit at a time
I’ve never tried daytrading. All my investments are intended for touching in like 5 years. 
This is less day trading and more discount buying
I should probably go reblance my portfolio
You are still actively playing the market. 
Which isn’t bad. I’m just saying I have no experience with it. 
yes, I'm playing the market
but definitely NOT day-trading
this is my attempt at timing the market
I'm all in with brenden's response, day trading is like playing the lottery where your the house, you can still lose really big, but not always
I see people begging for money and I by default assume it a scam.
saying you're the house indicates you'll come out on top in the long term
which doesn't necessarily follow in day trading
especialy when you factor in the high tax rates on gains
I'm say that the market increases overtime, and if you invest enough money to beat the fees, and if you do it right taxes are only on _*net gains*_ that means you do win in the long run.  Wether it's better do that then say work is open for debate
over the last week im in pain from just sitting too much
I am currently squatting at my desk
Fancy, how many squats are you doing?
just 1 but for like 15 minutes
What's everyone up to this afternoon
like during work or after it?
Both!
I'm monitoring an integration of my app into the monoapp. I don't think I have afterwork plans.
They canceled our Xpod outing today because of the Pandemic
Realizing this is a pandemic makes me want to play pandemic and be like "This is easy, why don't they just let me run the CDC!"
I don't get what the kid asking about the mail room is up to, but this is why sending stuff to work is a terrible terrible idea
It's also fun watching him panick
I've sent high value stuff to the mailroom
like my current laptop
wasn't going to risk that getting stolen from my apartment mail room
I guess, but at the end of the day you can probably wait to get your item
yeah, but if they're not there to receive a package, likely it will get refused and returned to sender
I mean if you guys are that concerned about package theft, why not get a PO box?
Something you control, that's not tied to the fact you might not have access tomorrow
we have dark chocolate hummus in rthe fridge
currently binging
LOL!
sounds gross
That will all be gone before the end of the day
It's sooo quiet today
/roll 2d20k-1+3
<@UETS9HTSS> State of emergency :panic2::siren::wfh:
oh I know
check my dumb question channel
way ahead of you
context?
mass declared a state of emergency
51 new cases of covid-19
:panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2:
Yup we're all gonna die now boys
I'm not gonna lie, the stuff that's happening right now feels like the opening scene from every disaster movie I've ever seen
I'm pretty sure that bot only triggers to annoy me
maybe it should attach your original meaning as a thread
Anyway, I'm pretty sure we're in a disaster movie
Ohhhh I like that, and that shouldn't be hard to implement! TIME TO BREAK STUFF AGAIN!
remember that too much snow can also trigger a SoE
I mean I've lived through those
You just hide at home for a day or 2
yup. just so long as we aren't getting hyperbolic here
SoE because of tiny invisible killers, :panic2:  is the only proper response
Ohhh I agree, I'm just saying so many disaster movies start opening scene is this stuff it's hard not to be like "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE I SAW IT IN _______"
should be plugged in now
wow that was fast
the codebase is getting easier to work with
Is it because you're constantly slapping my hand and saying "Bad coder bad!"
It's actual kinda weird to think about this is the first time I'll be dealing with a pandemic
Still a lot abstracting that can be done still as well to make it even easier.
depends how you define it. you lived through swine flu. and west nile
West Nile is still around
And swine flu wasn't a real pandemic, it just made college kids sick and closed down universities
Its the PAX people all getting stick now
Covid-19 is like a _real pandemic_ :tm:
:panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2::panic2:
I thought it was that stupid Biogen conference
Well that too, but i seriously doubt nobody was affected at pax
Most of the cases are either directly Biogen or community spread due to biogen
:phew:
I like Pax going under the radar because then I can feel like "Not me!"
These things always make you wonder when the appropriate time to panic is
because we're only allowed to panic after people have created an outbreak
I don't think panic is ever appropriate
Clearly Daka, you have more faith in humanity than I do
Faith? I'm not saying i trust people not to panic. I'm pretty sure panic is never the right answer though
Funny that it's a common answer though
ready for the work from home test, that will suddenly be extend to a test week
im ready to panic but it would be SO TIRING
I don't think I'm capable of panic
Everything will be ok. Prepare calmly. 
I just wish they'd take more proactive steps. This feels a little too much like closing the barn after the horse left
Yeah, the US response has been terrible. 
I mean Trump says it's all a hoax by the deomcrats so...
Turns out all those people trying to dismantle government can actually mess up the government. 
This is why :panic2:
Nope. 
No :panic2:   
I know right? Hit something enough times it eventually breaks
doug- we arent actually panicking
Are you sure aysh?
haha like- my heartbeat is normal
<https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-new-york-national-guard-cuomo-containment-zone-new-rochelle-a9391296.html|https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-new-york-national-guard-cuomo-containment-zone-new-rochelle-a9391296.html>
Like I said, it's something out of a disaster film
Nice. 
I'm with Doug most if not everyone will live but it's a super awkward moment
Sounds like Daka and I need another drunk conversation on the statistics of people begging for money being scammers (and how that stat is low)
It's not hard to read your pig Latin
Too much effort!
FYI: Marissa and I broke up today
Biden wins Mississippi. Michigan polls close at 9pm, that's the big one to watch tonight.
sorry to hear that. never fun, even if its the right thing
Michigan shows Bernie as leading
Sorry!
exit poll or pre-vote poll?
looks like vote counts being tallied; looking at google
I'm surprised they are reporting anything before the last polls in the state close
Now it's neck and neck with biden leading slightly
This is slightly amusing to watch
How so?
yeah, don't watch they update 20 votes here and there. Biden up 40 people in a race which in 2016 ended up with around 1.2 million votes is nothing
Awwwww that's a bummer sorry bro!
If I have to self isolate for even three days, this slack is going to hear a lot more from me
You're gonna be so sad
My weekend dance classes have been cancelled for the month.
awwwwww
Yeah, I have a feeling this channel will see a fair bit more activity from many of us. 
because we're all bored and lonely?
Yup. And stir crazy
Well I'll save about two hours a day if I'm not commuting
That’s a pretty good perk. 
Biden 53%, Bernie 40% in Michigan. 62% reporting, CNN called it over.
With Michigan for Joe, I think the primary is over.
Ah man, sorry to hear that. Doug said it best though already, even when it is right, it sucks.
Yup Biden vs. Trump in "Who's more senile for the office of highest power!!?!?!"
Ugh, are there enough states left for Bernie to make any kind of contested convention?
No this one is done
Biden is just like a repeat of Kerry/Bush 2004
I was thinking more Hillary/Trump 2016
but sure!
And exactly the wrong lesson to take away from 2016
Hillary/Trump was no incumbent though
And Bush was a shit show but the end of the Democrat primaries was like "Seriously, that's all they could come up with against Bush?"
No Kamala, Warren, Yang, Buttigieg, or Bernie. The best we could get was bland toast Biden?
What's his campaign? "Well he's not dumb ass Trump"
Real inspiring.
YEs
But just as senile
Should play great with the older crowds
"Remember Obama? Well, here's a reminder of that...but he's old...and white"
Like watch as every youth vote once again crumbles and fails to show up because the guy that got them excited got pushed aside for the party pusher.
Like, I'm glad we don't have Bloomberg...but that's about it
I mean one could say that happened with Bernie, although I have significant issue with the idea that I fit in the same age category last primary as I do this primary
Honestly this whole shit show makes me wonder if I should become more involved
How would you do that?
Just go do stuff
Like? These are serious questions
State level is so much easier to control
And it has such an outsided impact
Take the state of mass for example, who's in our electorate?
Do you even know who the sentators are, or how much they won by
No, not at all. That doesn't answer my question though. Like would you run for state Senate?
And I mean state senate not national senate reps.
Either find a part you align with, not the dems or the reps, and then figure out where you need to win
Figuring out how you win will always be an issue, but I think that if you get in front of it, don't wait for the election, you'll get what you need.  You just need to be involved
It's all name recognition and smiling
Well, where you need to win is not going Green Rainbow or some other current 3rd party, it's get the kind of legislation passed to make the voting possible for those kinds of parties to thrive
Ranked choice for example
Yea but what I'm saying Drew is you can do that! You just need to do it at a level you can influence, the local level
Pretty sure maine has rank choice
They do for now. The Republicans in Maine are trying to repeal it
I'm just saying, if the only way to get involved is run for local office, that feels a little slim pickings.
Yes, there are enough delegates for Bernie to win. But he has to get like 70% of the vote in every remaining state. 
And what I'm saying is that sure it's slim pickings, that makes it easier to influence
How many people do you actually need to motivate to vote for you? 1,000? 2,000?
Depends on the election you are tied to. If it is an on cycle one, quite a few thousand, and probably need to run with at least a D or R next to your name until you get the ranked choice thing through
But it is a crap ton of work. Good luck doing that with your normal day job.
So in the mass state senate, you need to mobilize about 40,000 people for a seat
I'm not saying it's easy Drew, but I'm seriously wondering if it's necessary
Probably. Got to get these local politics younger representation
We're just back to what you were saying before about the system being so broken you almost need to double down and let Trump destroy it so the Dems become an actual adversarial party or the populace tears it down for something new
Fuck that, break the 2 party hold
Still will be Biden over Trump, but even if he wins I seriously doubt the damage will be reversed. At best the bleeding stops for 4 years
I was telling Mei, you really want to fuck with the system, you need like 5 seats in the National Senate, 2 dem and 3 republican, and now you become the tie breaker
Stopping the bleeding isn't going to get us anywhere for long unfortunately
Agreed, I'm just saying I understand your perspective
Huh? Explain more in detail please
So what's the primary fucked up with the national system?
Each side is only ever trying to win a 50 % majority
so they can pass their laws
But if you're a dark horse you don't need a 50% majority
You just need to make sure no one _else_ gets it
And since it's Dem vs. Rep, they're not going to agree with each other, which means if either side wants something to happen they need to agree with you!
Or said another way, you can pass both Rep and Dem laws, but only the laws that agree with your stance
But you need more than 1 seat. You need like 5 or 10
Hard to do that as a solid group
You need at least 5 states
I did say 5 seats
3 republican 2 dems
I wonder if you could get that in the North east?
3 Republican 2 Dems is where you lose me. You mean takeaway 3 from one party and 2 from the other?
That would be absurd.
yea 5 seats total, this doesn't work if you take all 5 seats from one party
Right. So it’s possible, but not actually. 
I mean, by contrast, yes Liege are softer and sweeter than Brussels ones. 
They are good, but since you usually put chocolate or whip cream or fruits on top anyway, the crispiness is a nice texture change. Liege is basically just double down on the sugar.
Just kind of crazy considering how much of a runaway start Bernie had. He got screwed by all of the votes dropping out coalescing around Biden instead of a random distribution between the 2
I know Aysh hates it, but contraction bot has become my favorite. 
Really?
I would like it to be worked on more, and I think it kicks in a little too often for my tastes.
Hehehehehehehe
Why what else would you like to see?
Thank god I didn't have practices lol
no it doesn't count
I'm fine with how often it kicks in since it is not disruptive to the readability of the message
I saw those in Germany hahaha so expensive
I'm working from home....... only one more week of work after this week
Then I'm stuck with parasite and household chores
I just want to see some of the cases where it contracts things weirdly worked out. I've honestly had more situations where it contracted something weirdly and made it hard to read than with the Pig Latin bot (while recognizing I'm in the minority on that bot)
It won't be a parasite at that point though. It'll be a baby!
dev
sorry
I have no idea what you're trying to get at here
I didn't see any of those, no
Are you saying when it does it weird you have a problem or you want more of it?
Dev is prod and prod is prod here
WE HAVE NO DEV!
I don't even attempt to read pig latin
it is my least favorite bot
When it does it weird, it creates a problem CJ
Open a jira ticket for Prometheus 
I mean if you want to kill the Pig Latin bot, I won't miss it.
:lol: you cannot report a bug without examples drew gosh
Make the dash bot an underscore bot again while you're at it
I will tag examples from now on!
We actually should set up a request backlog. 
but... that would defeat the whole purpose of the underscore bot
I'm with Daka on this, I gave up reading it
Also I think we found a good balance with the scrambler
See, it just take a little refining
I don't think I have seen it scramble in like a month
It has, you can just read it much easier now
I do want to be clear that it can still scramble really big messages, just VERY VERY RARELY
I know, well aware.
And when it happens, it'll be hilariously frustrating
Also wait, why is the underscore bot defeating the purpose?
I like how we have had issues with double posting bots, random dejaVus, and awful redactions, but the contractions are what bug you the most
And that actually works the best out of most the bots
The underscore bot being dashes is the joke
Actually no, Brenden changed it because it annoyed him so much, and I left it alone because it still makes me happy
Yeah, the joke is to bug him with underscores. Though he does have the 3rd person bot attached to him
Can we make a bot that chooses a new target to attack for a week?
Like a parasite that just jumps from person to person every week and you basically play hot potato with it
Yup. wouldn't be hard. could even call it the parasite bot
question is what it would do
We just have to think of what it would actually do to the affected person
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDC4QL95G> :this:
There is nothing wrong there
:lol:
Dev is my brother's name
Why the hell did it change actually? That's not a construction!
It is specifically replaced in code
I did not put that in there, it's all <@UDL020K8D>
``` _inner_upper = {
    "Of the": "O'",
    "You all": "Y'all",
    "Over": "O'er",
    "Ever": "E'er",
    "Never": "Ne'er",
    "Yes": "Yup",
    "Actually": "Act'ly",
    "When": "W'en"
  }```
again, actually is what bugged you? not `o'what't'd`
"What't'd"?!?!?
I think parasite bot should replace what you are saying with something close to what you originally said, but with key differences. Like a few words flipped to their opposites, or an ending word replaced with a more ridiculous noun or verb
of what it would

what it -&gt; what't

what't would -&gt; what't'd
You can tag it with a little parasite emoji similar to deja vu
And I wrote the message, I know what I typed! Doesn't make it any more readable
we would need to identify what words to replace and with what
Yeah, would take some work to develop this
with context `o'what't'd` is quite readable.
Ugh, fine, leave it. Whatever.
More interested in developing a parasite.
Just imagine the person writting it is scottish
Also maybe finally fixing the bots so they play nice with each other
So we get a message that 5 bots have had their effects on
wait, why isn't `to` a prefix? like to the -&gt; t'the
Doug?
He played with them to make sure the capitals worked
to is just not in the list. i don't think it was ever implemented
Also getting bots to work best together is a more complex problem than it sounds
I mean it's just a massive refactoring of how our whole system works
You've already figured out the logistics of it, you just need to do it.
Drew, don't go down south, what't'd is a common contraction
It's less about the refactor and more about the "what is the best and most extensible way to implement this feature"
We sacrificed the ability to hard-code how bots interact by making them much easier to create
One possible implemntation is to create a type of Session object that will store the Event, User, Slack Interface, and Data accessor.
Then beef up our Event objects to be more usable
In what way are children not parasites
Yea, so each bot has a "trigger event" and a "change event"
Basically we'd have to make the if statements a function, and the stuff below the if statements a function
That was my design, just haven’t put in the effort to do it yet. 
trouble is designing an intuitive way to specify which bots should interact and how
Which given that fact we're all for chaos, make it a random order for :lol:
For example: The redacted bot. Bans wont work post contraction bot as the words no longer exist
And that's fine (in my opinion)
I agree with Daka. It still doesn't pay rent and steal all my resources.
Yea, I never got anything on top, other than maybe powdered sugar. But they're my favorite things... So good
Sorry to hear that man! Hopefully you're feeling alright
I think I know of three people who canvassed this election in Mass. All for Bernie.
Our plane just aborted take off...so that was fun
Its the coronavirus!
our plane take off was just aborted, that was fun?
<@UDDE5960N>
Our plane aborted take off...so that was fun
like you starting going fast and decided to stop
or like you never really accelerated?
We were mid acceleration. Hadn't started generating any lift, but probably going between 60-80 mph on the runway
Pilot just came on and said it was an electrical problem. But he made the whole announcement in French before he made the English announcement, so who knows what he said the first time that he forgot to include the second time
Sounds like a great time
This made me happy
I would change nothing
<@UDC03KCGK> The best part is it almost makes sense in the new structure
Oh yeah, exactly how I want my 7.5 hour flight to get going, with a mysteriously long delay due to faulty electric work on a big airplane...
Would you appreciate if we had an emoji trigger for when drew gets scrambled
HAHAHAHAHAHA
Fun fact, it was only 5.5 going this way. I knew the jet stream made it take longer to go west than east, but for domestic flights that has only ever tacked on an hour
i dont see the point in creating chaos bots and then making them simpler :confused:
nahh
no no i was just trying to unscramble
I'm thinking less go help established positions and more how do you break the current power structure
Would you appreciate if we had an emoji trigger when Drew gets scrambled.  Not simple, just obvious
It kinda does. I am totally fine with the new scrambler settings. It happens more often, but in much less annoying and unimportant ways.
Don't confuse jetstream with world rotation too
Jetstream was the answer I was given any time I looked it up for domestic coast to coast flight time differences
Did I tell all the story of what happened when I flew back to Michigan? It was so weird.

I flew through Charlotte. When I landed I heard that the control tower there had caught fire earlier in the day. but I guess that didn't actually delay me any? weird. so my flight to GRR is delayed due to a storm out of Florida (where my plane is coming from). Plane arrives, I'm in line to get on when they tell everyone to sit down. We see a worker head onto the plane with a big roll of duct tape. I heard once I'm on the plane from a steward that a person getting off the plane had pulled their charger too hard, pulling out the socket, exposing loose wires on the seat. They literally duck taped it as a fix.

Then I get to GR, and the plane sits on the tarmac for 30 minutes when the pilot announces on the plane that the reason we're not moving is that the tower isn't returning his calls. so we don't have a gate. and there is a plane in front of us in the same boat. So the pilot is literally flashing his lights, trying to get the tower to respond. eventually we get in and weirdly I find I had a family member on the flight ahead of us, also stuck on the tarmac. anyway, that made me late for a wake.

So a couple days later, leaving GR. We're on the plane when like 3 snowflakes fall. So they declare they have to de-ice the plane. Pilot notes that Michigan is used to snow, so they have good procedures and de-icing shouldn't delay anything. except once the de-ice-ing truck gets out to us, it runs out of gas. so they have to tow it out of the way and wait for another truck to free up to de-ice us. so then I'm delayed getting to Charlotte. I run across the airport, but the doors had closed on my connecting flight so I miss it. Talking to the person behind the desk they say "oh, we saw you come in way on the other side of the airport, wondered if you were going to make it in time". so they knew I was running across the airport. ugh
Yeah, that sounds like a fun week of air travel. Though I've seen and had family members deal with the duck tape stories before. For example duck taping the wing
Connection flights do not make me happy
lol hi rick'
Apparently it's all jet stream all the way
I forgot to mention this earlier this morning
Interesting
I got ready for work, walked out my front door, checked my phone, turned around and went back inside because none of my team is in the office today
once we all WFH tomorrow, are people going to go back into the office on Friday?
Somehow doubt it
I have a symphony ticket for next week. I wonder if they will still perform. so many old people there.
yeah, probably not
Is Wayfair having everyone WFH tomorrow?
everyone who can. Its just a test to make sure the network can handle that much traffic.
they are not actively closing the offices yet or anything.
wonder how that's gonna work for all our design people with thier beefy pcs
If all goes well
Rumor is next week

looks like Drew is still stuck in a stationary metal bird
There is a high likelihood that someone on that plane is contagious, and everyone will think they have COVID-19
I would think it would be the best option available
Um, got a better source than the NY Post? Not exactly a quality reporting publication
Nope, just an electrical issue they fixed. They are refueling the plane currently
Still taking forever though
are you flying out of DeGaulle?

CNN says italy is on a war footing
direct? or are you going through iceland or whatever
Looks like the same news that's been coming out for the last week. Italy did not handle this well at all
Direct
And you think the US is handling it better?
Is anyone handling it well?
I've said the only way to get a handle on this is brutal lock down tactics, and I don't think the US can pull it off
Sure, china and South Korea have both stablized
Bernie conference at 1pm est
He didn't speak last night.
could be him saying this is the normal post-results speech, just waiting a little longer for results to come in
I wouldn't believe anything China says, so I'll agree South Korea is probably stabilized, but did they handle the situation well? Not sure, their numbers skyrocketed in the first few weeks they had cases
Michigan had a lot of late results due to absentee ballots, I think Washington had a ton of mail-ins that won't be fully counted for a week or two
Germany? They're suppose to be testing like fiends over there
could be a concession speech, but I wouldn't guarantee it. His people last night were still talking up the Sunday debate
No, US has been bad about it. I'm kind of with Dakota on this one though. People are really scared about getting it despite it being something that seems to really only dangerously affect the older population. 
So, yeah, would suck to get sick, but I'd recover. I'd still be a good citizen and not go out and spread it further, but not something I'm suddenly going to worry about for my own safety
I'm less concerned about the number of cases because this is designed to sky rocket
I think the bigger question that we haven't seen drew is what the death rate is left untreated
I don't understand
That's what a lot of the informed talk is about now, it's not that it has a low death rate its what happens when ANYONE can't get care because EVERYONE's trying to get care
So people are being put on ventilators to keep them alive.  What's the death rate without ventilators because that's what will happen if this spreads to far too fast
Again, if I'm quarantined in my house as a 28 yr old, I'm not receiving care.
:facepalm:
There's a difference between being quarantined as a precaution and being quarantined because your sick
Ok, what I'm reading is most people get over it. Without any actual care. They stay in their apartment, ride it out, get better. 
If they are older, they have a higher percent chance of being hospitalized and it is deadly.
The majority of people with Covid-19 can be managed at home. But among <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130|44,000 cases in China>, about 15% required hospitalization and 5% ended up in critical care. In Italy, the statistics so far are even more dismal: More than half of infected individuals require hospitalization and about <https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/coronavirus-in-italy-fills-hospital-beds-and-turns-doctors-into-patients/2020/03/03/60a723a2-5c9e-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html|10% need treatment in the ICU>.
The point here is that only 80% of the time are you going to be ok at home.  1 out of 5 or roughly 4 of us in the channel will require some sort of hospitalization
What happens to those 4 when you can't get it
We don't know
Ok, that makes a bit more sense. What I was reading was 70% of those affected making a full recovery without needing any hospitalization
Totally, and I agree most people are fine
But the 1-2% death rate is with medical care, what does that become when 30% of people who need it don't get it does it go to 5 or 10%?
That's what terrifies me right now
Valid, and answers my questions
However, I'm still in an industry where I don't really have the option to stop showing up to work unless they close down or are mandated by the state
Still stuck on metal bird. We had to unbuckle our seat belts while they refueled. Not sure the hold up and no further announcements. We were supposed to take off at 3:40. It's 5:48 now
/roll 1d20 +1

legally
Ohhhhh, I'm not arguing that Drew. And even taking that one step further say the state mandates that they close, what happens after a month of that
How do you eat, how to pay rent/mortgage? A vast majority of american's live pay check to pay check, any interruption can have massive impact
I'm legitimately concerned about what the last impacts of this will be
Yeah. I'd be o.k. (not great) but most of my coworkers would not be doing so hot
Italy paused mortgage payments. Can't collect on those while people are unable to work
This is the US not Italy, so doubt they'll take that wholesome approach
Anyway, the plane still is sitting here and my phone is gonna die unless this plug kicks in above 10,000 feet. So I'll chirp back in when I land back in Boston
This is why you should travel with an external battery pack
I've got one that could charge my phone for quite a few days
I mean this is going to have massive social impact just like any other pandemic, the part that people don't understand is that before it was just expected that people would die.  Today we have the ability to stop that, and we're going to fail
bye bye drew
I also make sure my phone has a good charge
I just stood up for :coronavirus: in #nonwork-emoji
and pretty sure I failed
people are too sensitive
also that's the wrong emoji in this instance
apparently it's already been deleted and re-added
WTF
I mean Alexa is my definition of a snowflake, "If I find it offensive I want it removed, but if you find it offensive you're just an asshat".  Just because she's progressive does not make her right
don't know about `but if you find it offensive you're just an asshat`
but agree with the rest
snowflake is kind of an annoying term. be aware it comes with baggage.
what sort of baggage?
She got on the "If you're not gay you don't get an opinion"
And yes I'm exactly outline why that baggage exists
ok, I'm killing pigBot
Apparently not threading the orignal message
oof
done
wasn't that rachel?
Snowflake is what MAGA crowd used to define liberals who can't take a joke.  I'm saying that Alexa is that person
Oh
didn't know that
but it somewhat fits
It was both of them, rachel started it but Alexa was willing to tag team
A common refrain was "18 year olds in 1945 jumping into jaws of death (Picture of omaha beach landing) 18 year olds today words hurt (with a emo looking male)"
rough
Anyway from where I sit, rachel and alexa both fit that, not because I disagree with what they say all the time, but I almost always disagree with how they say it
who is alexa?
Example you're trying to understand how some black humor is ok, and this is not, and her response is `like i literally just explained. if you can't see it by now, im not going to waste my breath explaining it to you` or `well i tried explaining nicely why i dont like it, and i'm kind of exasperated`
Which are adhomin attacks don't progress the conversation and make her just as bad as the people she hates (to me)

So some hometown friends and I are going to new orleans for a bachelor party in may
someone wants to throw a parade for the bachelor
it'll cost $1500-$1800
That seems like a lot for a very short amount of time
The US doesn't have the balls or the good will to do what needs to happen that's why
................ thats kind of ridiculous
give them the money if youre feeling generous
This is gonna be an epic shit show here, and we're gonna look like the worlds biggest dumbasses
I mean how long of a parade and what kind of parade
I'm guessing it'll be split ~10 ways
but still
I was assuming that's cheap
I mean the next recession has been looming over our heads all of the trump presidency, the fact that it hasn't happened yet is because people have been drinking the :drink-the-koolaid:
Really that seems cheap for a parade brenden, for permits and resources and things to do
Most of it is cheap because of volunteers
I'm pretty sure we are already the joke of the world after electing Trump
yeah- this is like, nail in coffin
probably
yea but when we literally suffer as badly as 3rd world countries from this... it's gonna be bad all around in the US
Definitely
I JUST ADDED THE PRObably because i dont want to seem like im panicking :smile:
i also want to go to orleans
is there an old orleans?
in France
It's called Orleans
Joan of Arc was known as The Maid of Orleans
(its not pronounced the same)
ahhhh
so the american one is like or-leans. the french is or-le-ons
everyone has an equivalent of trump right now because the world is going to :poop:
Nahhhhhh, most of the first world countries will pull through better
The US is gonna light on fire
Thoughts, does having touch screens make pandemics worse because there's more surfaces that need to be disinfected?
i feel like physical keyboards/pads are harder to clean
Expensive
assuming you actaully talk on the phone
easy to clean, but also more area to get dirty
I mean on a touch screen you are touching virtually every part of the face of the phone, then holding it to your face
I bought a uv "bath" for my phone
but there are a lot of things we touch regularly
I don't hold my phone to my face very often
you should put your t pass i that UV machine too
you actually touch your T pass?

`To that end, we are putting emergency policies in place that will ensure all employees who have to miss work due to COVID-19 illness, requested quarantine or site shut down will have paid time off`

this is really nice i think?
its pretty generous compared to a lot of places in the US. No mandatory paid sick leave is crazy as national policy
I can't do a good portion of my job from home...hoping that won't be a statewide thing
Nice is a questiionable statement Aysh as the US has a really low bar
i mean- its better than no pto?
Yes yes it is

Oh whoa. Cj that's right

Wow
Nah i'll be going to sleep soon

Glad your back
Don't doubt me Aysh!

```I was recently in a car accident that totaled my vehicle. Due to the circumstances of the accident, I am being told that insurance will NOT cover the damages.. To give you a little back story, I had just gotten off of work around 6:30pm, within a couple of minutes I'm stopped at a red light, next thing I know.. someone crashes into me and cops are on the scene within seconds...I was informed that the person who caused the accident was involved in a high speed chase, in a stolen vehicle.. AND they also kidnapped a girl and held her at gunpoint.. they crash into me (totaled both of our vehicles) but the GOOD news is..the cops were able to rescue the girl, I didn't suffer any serious injuries, the bad people were caught and we all lived happily ever after... 
Just kidding 
Fast forward to the day after.. I call the car owners insurance company to file a claim and I was told that they will NOT cover any damages caused while a crime is being committed.. the gentleman also informed me that NO insurance company will pay out if an accident was caused while any illegal activity took place.. I honestly thought to myself "this is a joke, right?" So I contacted a lawyer who specializes in car accident cases to find out what my options were...They told me the SAME thing.. I was informed that my only option was to sue the individual who caused the accident, but not only is it a lengthy process, but the chances of them actually having the funds to pay me out if I won the case is slim to none... so here I am... I've decided to make a Go Fund Me after I have exhausted all of my other options.. Due to the fact that I filed for a chapter 13 bankruptcy a few years ago, the only places that will approve me for financing are scam lots that sell you an over priced hunk of junk...for example, I was quoted $22,500 for a 2013 Kia Soul.. the cheapest car they offered was over $9k and that's BEFORE all of the fee's and the 24.5% interest rate... the second car lot I went to wasn't any better... So.... again... here I am... hoping and praying that a good bit of people will help me in my time of need.. I am in need of a vehicle to get to and from work, I live alone.. and I don't have any family that can help.. so I was hoping you could find it in your heart to help a sista out
, search your sofa cushions, check your pockets in your laundry hamper, and spare a little change to help me out. $1..$5..$10 can go a long way! Even just sharing my fundraiser can help. I appreciate your time and consideration. Peace and Blessings to you all

I've heard nothing from my work. They emailed me last week about where I was out of the country in case they needed me to go to a doctor first, but nothing since. I'm not sure how business is going there or if the company (based out of Portugal) is mulling over shutting down the markets any time soon.
They are doing road repairs just down the street from me. I didn’t mind yesterday since I just went to work. Now I’m probably going to hear jackhammers all day.

That’s annoying.

3 confirmed cases around me :smile:
All. 
i thought he did say that- he said they would be subject to screening
That's stupid the whole reason we're banning europe is because you can travel freely
because he thinks ireland is part of UK
Oh, maybe. I’m just reading that he said a couple things wrong and his people corrected him after. Maybe I got the wrong piece
God this whole thing just highlights how dumb our gov is
oh. the president is stupid? what a novel thing to say
I mean this is going way beyond him, he can't string together 2 sentences
I want to know the moron who's like, I should put this in front of the dumbest person ever, no way this will get chosen
Also, i think that part if for those who are re-entering. ban might still be in place for those who are trying to leave
Oh, that could be right. 
video shoots?? wanna hear more
Did they take away your baguetts and chocolate? By the way for next time, the answer is there is no food.
we choreograph existing music and upload to youtube. its not  high production value but it is fun
I want a GoFundMe campaign too
Starting Friday, cause I certainly didn't get quarantined
Fake, but amusing:
someone photoshopped this
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
and posted a news article that hospital staff rolled it into his quarrantine
AWWWWWWW
I have to go to the hospital today.......... good luck to me
Uhh why?
nice!
checkups
I'm forced to care about the parasite
oh yeah, you have that rare pregnancy
No not at all

So basically, CJ was WRONG!
Fine, I'm still of the opinion this is his way to :f_that:
Because he's only targeted China, Iran, and EU, while leaving SK alone
Stock market is down again. Back to 21,000 after hitting a high of, what, 28,000?
Yeah I know it's great. Finally I can start investing!
I'm mean that's not a shocker with the travel ban
It's gonna get worse
I'm just curious if I should start putting some money in now week after week until we hit bottom. Or just hold out a little longer because it will 100% get worse
Like good time to buy some oil stocks
Best strategy is to continual invest small portions of money as you will never be able to time the actual lowest point
Questionable on the oil stock, a lot of the stuff up for grabs in the US is only profitable if oil is pricey (above $80 i think).  It's possible for those companies to have real problems in the near term with liquidity and solvency
I'm not worried about XOM or Chevron disappearing in the next 10 years
I didn't time it well
I started yesterday
but I'll keep dropping stuff into the market
How about the fact that chevron is still spending a truckload of money lobbying Congress with policies to make climate change worse?
yeah my brother advised me to put a BIG chunk of my savings into investments (im clueless with all this) and now im like...i should have waited :confused:
Did you put the money in before the crash?
i started 1 week ago
oof
Is this as a way of assessing whether they are a decent investing play? Or is this an ethics point?
:big-oof-bidoof:
I mean it's worth noting you'll get it all back over a long enough time horizon, and more than if you left it as savings
I have it set up where I automatically put in a set amount every month. Sometimes it’s higher, sometimes lower. Should work out in the end. 
Just don't pull it out
yeah its like....retirement savings
I have all my money in a bank with decent interest rate :lol:
That is gonna change pretty soon though
Eh, I might disagree there
what do you define as decent
Fluctuates between 1.5 and 2%
Nope, statically speaking right now is the worst time to pull money out
That's shitty. Good for a savings account. But shitty
time to increase 401 contributions?
You've already missed the safe haven window, and pulling it out now means you'll lag putting it back in, meaning you'll miss a lot of the recovery too
Defining buy high sell low
Yup. I could get more with CDs or stocks etc. but i'm lazy
Like, do you have 5,000 in that account you won't touch for the next 10 years? 
Put that in a bond. Instantly doing better
I mean at least your not _losing_ money
Yeah but i don't really like the idea of not being able to touch the money for 10 years
but that is not my definition of decent
and I don't really care how fast it is growing tbh.
10 years seems a bit much
as long as i'm not losing money
with inflation its pretty much losing money
That's not growing that stagnate to loss
Look at money market accounts at least
CDs are 10 years brenden
i have 1 year CDs?
Could get a 3 yr or 5 yr treasury bond
just create a betterment account and have them manage it for you
or one of the similar ones
wtf is a betterment account
and if i had done so, would I have just lost a bunch of money?
<https://www.betterment.com/>
Bonds no
quite probably
but depends on your allocation
you get to choose what kind of asset mix you have
and they handle what to actually invest in
Stocks yes, I'd also phsycially hit you for realizing that kind of loss
If we're as convinced it'll keep going down as much as we think, then sell now, and wait till it drops more. That "you'll make it back" given enough time is actually horseshit depending on how high the stock was.
WTF? This assumes you can time the market, and that it doesn't recover to this point before you can re-invest
```I'd also phsycially hit you for realizing that kind of loss```
huh?
It goes today, tomorrow it's back up, Monday it's down again
If you're truly lazy, go to fidelity, and invest in a money market account, you pay a small fee for fidelity and technically a small fee for the money market manager but those should be built in the profit
Take BAC for example. Prior to 2007, it was a $50 stock. I bought in during the early part of the recession at around $22. It bounced up to $35 at one point. Didn't sell, it went down to $30...then kept going. One point it was $2. 
It didn't hit $22 again until about 2 years ago. 
It has NEVER come close to $55 again
A majority of stock value is in capital (aka the price of the stock)
Money markets are actively traded by a professional and you can buy in for relatively cheap, they're also built to be diversified
I'm taking this to a different thread
<@UDC4QL95G> Thread on how stocks make you money
Or most investments honestly
But, had you missed the bottom, you could have still jumped in again at $7 pretty easily. 
Then when it got to $35 earlier this year, you made 5x your investment. Whereas not selling at $22, meant you made 50%
more an ethics question.
So stocks have what's known as capital (which is the price of the stock) and dividends
1. buy stocks
2. ???
3. profit
So no, timing the market is impossible. Being able to say "we're going steady bear for at least 6 months"
That's much easier to hit
Dividends pay you out generally on a quarterly basis in cash, you get taxed on this immediately and will pay it out as part of your income for the year
This is at the discretion of the company, as standard practice this rarely decreases because it's seen as a massive red flag if a company can't make it's dividend
Cool, do the dividends actually pay non-negligable amounts?
Yes, depending on the company they can be over 5%
The other way you make money on stocks is known as capital.  Now this is where it gets trickery, because it's about timing now
You buy stock for 5$, and it goes up to 8$
Hold up, I know how the timing part of stocks works
That's known as unrealized gain
keep talking about dividends
Cuz that seems nuts
lol
Yeah honestly, in this market the only thing you've definitely lost money in is if you have stock and you sell. This is assuming the stock you have doesn't one day go under, and also that you are willing to stick on that stock for upwards of over 10 years (for some, even more)
Bonds? Won't matter unless you bought a bond from a company that goes out of business. But like a treasury bond is virtually guaranteed. 
CDs, same thing.
Yes if you buy a company like say CVS
They pay YOU on a quarterly basis
you are saying if I own 10k in a company stock, every quarter i should receive $500?
there are companies that have over 5%?
That's a really high dividend.
that is how dividends work
but that seems high
CVS is offering 50 cents for every stock you own
That's a 3.19% dividen
Oh shit, Chevron is 5%
SO if you own CVS stock for a whole year, they'll give you 2 dollars
BAC is 3%
Thanks guys I really do know finances
what are the mechanics there? when they pay a dividend, where does the money go? to your broker? do they mail it to you?
tends to get deposited in the brokerage account
you can set it up to reinvest if you like
Wait, does that mean my wayfair stocks have been paying me?
No
:oh:
Wayfair does not offer a dividen
wayfair is not a dividnd stock
Sucks
not really
Fucking A, Ford offers nearly 10%
Gonna go buy me some Ford...
worth noting trading is closed today
I have a limit order in, which is interesting
Is it? Prices are updated
<https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/stock-futures-hit-a-limit-down-trading-halt-for-a-second-time-this-week-heres-what-that-means.html>
oh, my bad
15 minutes, yes
it stopped for a few minutes
yes just to calm people
Yup never new about divadends. I always though stocks were a buy low sell high kinda thing so was never intrested
if you like payouts, also look at bonds
some of those pay out as well
Anyway dakota, based on the timing you have unrealized gains/losses or realized gains/losses, that will get taxed at short/long term capital gains taxes
I'm seriously gonna start investing more dividend heavy knowing what I can get from some of these companies.
actually, CJ, want to do a webinar for this? on hangouts? so we can ask questions without making things hard to read?
I mean sure
I have nothing on my calendar today.
<https://meet.google.com/jwb-fimp-tkh>
Ah, well yeah, they are a terrible company ethics wise. No doubt there. Thing is that most of the time for me with investing, you're not helping the company itself since you weren't part of the IPO. They pay you. Hell, you can even try to vote to get them to change their habits, not that you ever have any real power with your tiny shares.
no my day is full, wait for me too
We are talking in the middle of it

In case people didn't see this in the thread
we're doing it now. but sounds like CJ, Brenden, and Drew liking talking about this stuff, so they'll probably be willing to do to you about it later

Oh, did you close the meet too?
Yes Doug had no questions
Unless you Brenden and I want to argue the point is now over
Eh, fair enough. I like those financial discussions
We get to do this all over with Aysh
Well, honestly, I wouldn't mind picking your brain and Brenden's about ideas about the market and ways to redo finance
New thread!
Oh, but no meet?
New Financial Discussion Thread

No dying sweetie, you need to live!
Going to the office now, hopefully I’m not kicked out
Tell tony you're scared of all the sick people on the street!
well there goes half the population of boston :lol:
Hopefully he won’t notice me even though I sit across from him

whoa
I am liking Novavax these days. Could be worth it since they are one of multiple companies developing Corona Vaccine
I bought some novavax and inovio
I will have to look into Inovio
they got funding to develop said vaccine
Ehhh I don't like those cause their values are so wonky
Once the economy recovers stocks like Dunkin and Starbucks are sure to recover by around $10. Also I imagine the airlines are likely to bounce back nicely
Apparently a guy that Trump met from Brazil last week got the Corona
He's meeting everyone with corona
Starbucks and DD I'll have to look into
Or he's giving everyone he meets corona
As much as I don't want to wish death on anyone, having trump die, and the republican party fall apart because of this epic disaster they made would be the kinda karma I can get behind
I got found out because I started talking on the phone....
I wonder if I should wait cuz I feel like it could drop more
LOL!
Did you say hi to Tony?
hi tony!
I put my call on hold and lied about how I got to the office
Why couldn't you tell him the truth, that you had a doctor's appt in the city and in order to work, it was safer to be in a small office rather than a large public space?
cause mei is scared of people
Anyone here attached to Mark Corsillo? May I complain?
not I. I just know the emote
nah hes just an emoji to me
OHHH I"M HAPPY!
why???
oh to complain
please begin
i find the person very controlling
like-people post cat pictures in nonwork and he's trying to send them away
Yes, and story?
i asked about snacks on nonwork bos and hes was driving me away
brenden made a joke this afternoon and he tried to control that (Dont want to speak from brenden though- he agreed and deleted his joke)
Some people are just cranky aysh
....yeah, like me. but you cant go around controlling people. i dislike
youre so sane, CJ. I admire it
HAHAHAHAHA
I think you mean insane Aysh
Or evil
oh very evil
I'm willing to wait another few days on this
I'm having a day
Ohhh doctor's not go well?
I’m not allow on public transportation according to my ceo hahaha
I need a ultrasound cuz tummy is very small
Told you it's weird
Now I wish i was there
It’s only like a week or two smal
Small
uh huh
Wait what? Thought that was Drew saying he's having a day
he is
Why Drew?
Dunno, he was never heard from again
Drew!
<@UDC03KCGK>
Ultrasounds are weird
lol
You can see it’s spine, heart chambers, bones and etc. 
Rumor on the street is that trump might restrict US travel
he had a valid point there, I was directly contradicting the leadership advisory
to over 1000 people
It’s head is too big I think
I think Drew is dead
corona virus got hiim
But car?
Yea uber or drive into office 
He then looked at me today and say no office for prego lady
Me too
Links?
We will get you paper flowers 
To burn
WHAT?!?!?!
Phoebe with the big news

Nice.
It's in non work politics
Boris Johnson is in the same boat. Interacted with people tested positive and himself refused to get tested.

Whoa
I linked here
Its amwrt
Smart
Well, I'ma gonna just sit this week out for stocks cause boys and ladies we're in for a ride
I see that
The first time you could see all of its brain 
No it means future pain
Oh.
None of the stocks I brought previously went lower than when I brought it before
All my social activities have been cancelled and my brother wants me to go to be with him and his wife in middle of nowhere Arizona. Should I?
just for the isolation?
I'd say traveling is more dangerous
its an interesting tradeoff, getting out of the city, but getting on an airplane
if you hole up in your apartment for a while, that should be pretty similar to hanging out in Arizona, just in terms of how many people you're around
Roughly. Also they're both physicians who work in a hospital.
I'm also thinking of the effect on mental health :joy::black_heart::zipper_mouth_face:
that is a real consideration. Clearly if they are doctors they know more than we do
I'd stay personally, Boston is more likely to be able to provide for its citizens than AZ
I feel like wouldn’t doctors have higher chance of getting it
if they are actively practicing.
I'm sure they'll risk losing their license and smuggling a test if I needed it :joy:
hopefully we start getting more test kits flowing soon. There just aren't enough
Stupid to not have enough tests 
They are turning away people with symptoms because they don’t have tests. Without the positive test result they can’t give you a doctor note or anything else
And we have no idea what the count is
I'm tired from worrying
Is drew alive or not
I was going to pink too
Ping
i think he ded
Drew?
he went to doctor cause test
then said ominous
then no respond
brenden think drew dead
Yo. You're kidding.

that's the last we ever heard of <@UDC03KCGK> :rip:
<@UDC03KCGK> RIP
Thought it was about work
well his work is requiring him to get tested before he can go back
as they're concerned given his recent travel
I said that sounds illegal
he mentioned going to the doctor's
and calling his lawyer father
It’s probably just a catch-22 about needing a test he can’t get. 
We should probably avoid setting everyone on edge. Things are going to be a little touchy, unfortunately. 
That wouldn't stop him texting
He's probably just busy dealing with stupidity
I thought it was clear that I was joking about him being dead/sick
If not, sorry all
I just like poking the bear
Time Out insisting I need a dr. note.
Found out my health insurance lapsed because the auto-pay wasn't set up right
Got that fixed, but it will take a week
Found out my old doc takes my new insurance
Called their office to get an appointment
They are telling me I am supposed to quarantine for 14 days, but that the emergency room has the tests I need
Talk to insurance, they'll cover the test, but I have to go through the emergency room, which isn't covered until I meet my deductible
Do some math on how much I would make in those weeks....
So I'm quarantined till the 26th
and for clarification, the insurance part is getting fixed within the next 24 hours in case that was confusing. I started writing this out hours ago and just came back to it
Indeed
Eh, humor gets us through these things
I'm just really hoping I don't spend 2 weeks at home totally fine, go back to work, and then actually get sick within a week of returning.
That's so going to happen
Don't worry buddy
As my brother pointed out, I'll also get hit harder, because my immune system which was doing so well ever since I started doing this stuff will atrophy...
Lol no it was clear , you're good
Start a go fund me :joy::joy::joy:
:thinking-tilted:
Does Sam have insurance that would cover this?
that's broken
Wait what?
It's more affordable for drew to quarrantine himself than to get tested
So he's not working for the next two weeks
also his health insurance lapsed
so he needed to get that resolved
Uhhhhhh????? Why are repeating stuff?
becuase <@UDDE5960N> you said "Wait what?"
That was for the immune system atrophy stuff
I just found out the finance knowledge Dakota and Doug had... I’m concern
Did CJ steer us wrong?
i think she meant before today
Mei's amazed more people don't hoard money like dnd dragons
Simply that while I've been working at the bar, my immune system has been noticeably stronger. 
Take away that constant battery of pathogens to fight off, and it's going to not be in as great a shape as it was 3 weeks ago
She has the same insurance
I don't think your body falls apart that quickly
depends on how many coronas you've had that evening
not nearly enough of them
Not all of us were taught money.
I would argue that Mei was not taught money other than hoard it
Hoarding money is such a great feeling
This is the first I have seen describing the immune system like a person.
or a muscle, it makes sense, but generally you don't loose ability in the matter of weeks
lol i wasnt taught anything else! budget, write down all expenses, dont believe 'friends' who just talk to you for money- that a;; my grandfather told me
Kaushal Kabariya - was this the same person who was called out in that anonymous Q&amp;A? CJ?
Did you ever get a separate web chat with CJ and Brenden yesterday? I know you were in a meeting
never happened but figured ill meet with them sometime over the next 2 weeks :slightly_smiling_face:
Don't know that person
cool cool
why?
just someone who got promoted- name sounded familiar
lol
Wait how do you know that?
<https://homepage.wayfair.com/2020/03/11/winter-2020-promotions/>
that's my manager actually
where do you see that he got promoted?
oh found it
it's not under my org
as we roll up in to catalog
thanks for the heads up
yea I was taught not to trust even family hahaha
I'm thinking I might just come into the office anyway to work
don't do that
raelly?
i came in because i wanted to get lunch
lol
I want to come in because I have a better workstation here, better working environment, and just to get out of the apartment.
What is the problem with coming in if I do not take mass transit?
not to much more time for that
soonn you'll be there forever
only if I get sick
or the office actually closes
The office is close for the next 2 weeks
the office is closed to all but essential personnel
for two weeks
don't be that guy that breaks quarrantine
Yea what Brenden said
Did wayfair say don't come in for 2 weeks? Or don't come in and quarantine? One protects the office, one the staff
Office is closed, office is closed. That distinction isn't really important to "Should Daka go in?"
Answer is still no
Wayfair said work from home if you can
I was more questioning the quarantine bit
All non essential personnel should work from home
Technically protect the staff
Work from home is different than quarantine and will have different outcomes
Wayfair did not ask employees to quarantine
```Please note that we will keep the offices open with limited services```
Unless your sick
Then quarantine
It's still a good idea not to travel as that limits your exposure to morons
Sure, but walking to work means like no exposure to morons
Ohhh and for Finances, the market rebounded today
this makes you part of the problem
likely others will have this bad idea as well
this is an aggregate thing, not a you thing
So far yes. It is Friday though, so we have a whole weekend to see what news comes out that makes Monday go back down
similarly, even if you don't take public transit, you're still being more exposed
Damn spiffy
this is not for you
this is for the personnel that NEED to be in the office to do their job
Basically NOC or whatever the hell it is called now
Man, how much of a disaster movie must you feel like if you work WOC/NOC, whatever, right now? Empty office, big dim command center, but less and less active commute as companies tell people to wfh?
Quarantine day 2: started my taxes
Day 1 fool, you left your apartment yesterday
this is the same argument for why people should vote as "if everybody thought that way, nobody would vote".
partner team's coop's direct bedroom roommate at northeastern got tested positive
Nice
Hmmm, that is probably worth letting somebody in HR know
the timer isn't from the day I left my apartment, it is from the day I got back to the US
So you are saying you just violated the quarantine yesterday
oh
They are asking people to self quarantine, it isn't being strictly imposed. Considering customs and border police said literally nothing of it to me.
Regardless, it wouldn't make sense to reset the timer based on when I went out since the point is to see if anything incubated in that time
so I finished the work I need to do until Thursday
Nice
What are you going to do now?
anyone want to play TM?
I’ll make sure to grab the app today. 
Yeah, looks like I could use the app myself now
Super boring question but I need to know while I'm going through all these old folders and boxes of paperwork:
*Does anyone have a good sense on what records should be kept and for how long?* Obviously things like birth certificates and id info, but I'm talking all the random paperwork like bank statements, medical bills, 401k and other financial statements, crap like that?
:yay_tomato:
just buy a fire safe, leave it in a corner and throw all that in there
ideally with partitions for each year
I was taught to keep files for 10 years
People say three to five years for tax records. 
They're all different
scan and keep indefinitely?
that implies that hard drives don't fail
if you keep it in the cloud, you better not mind whatever company is hosting them peeking in
Also talking about a shit ton of scanning
Speaking of, I think that's why I can't find my tax records from last year...thanks Aysh!
Also do you prefer Ayshu to Aysh? <@UHQD9J1SL>
All equally accepted :slightly_smiling_face:
Does Back Blaze do that kind of crap?
Well, I'll see what I can find out online then, maybe report back while we are all analyzing financial stuff anyway
This 2 weeks is going to make me go crazy from all the stuff at home that I realize I have neglected. Computer organization is a mess, backups, desk, closets, cabinets.
If you don't hear from me after a while, assume I jumped off my balcony
Computer organization?
like... your files and stuff?
yeah
NOOOOOOO DREWWWWWWWWWWWWW
DO IT!!!!!!
we have a vacation to take! stay alive!
Man I have like nothing on my computer other than games
I can ask my accountant when I talk to them in a few weeks
Jump off a cliff, not the balcony1
vacay is done!
and everything I don't care about but should probably keep I just throw on a 4tb drive and forget about forever. I think I have all my college projects on there still
Well, for example tax docs. Scans of other stuff. Photos, videos
i use google drive for it all- is that bad?
Scans: None
Photos: None
Videos: None

Tax docs: Folder on desktop with PDFs
Which part bot? Desktop cuz I lost tax docs before.
Photo and videos none cuz i dont take photos or videos
Scans: Who the heck scans anything these days
I don't think so.
I just have a folder on my desktop with tax stuff. It might also be backed up to drive.
Thanks! I assume tax returns and w2s and those immediately associated forms. But bank statements, pay stubs, insurance decs, even just random medical bills with no tax association, I don't know. I tend to over save this stuff and it takes up way too much space.
Not a hoarder, but when it comes to this stuff I feel like one
who?
Automatic back up service
no idea
lol, this was in bos not politics
oh whoops, i saw rachel and assumed i was in that or activism
A fair assumption
Just read through nonwork emoji from the :coronavirus:  discussion. That was ridiculous
RIGHT!!!
I honestly can't even really tell what the image is for :coronavirus:
link?
If you right click the image, you can copy the URL and paste it into here to get it full sized
I can't do it bc I'm on my phone
alright, now I'm more confused: what is the argument against the image?
<https://emoji.slack-edge.com/TDBEDSEQZ/coronavirus/cb4c3c06d9d0d509.jpg>
No, I got the image thanks to Dave, I just don't get what people are upset about
cause people are whiny and this is serious
also brenden's picture had a face mask
AND HOW DARE YOU JOKE ABOUT SOMETHING WHERE PEOPLE DIE!
hahaha
thats funny
I...what?
peanut butter can also cause people to die, should we ban :peanuts: :gif: :peanut-butter-tears: ?
because :shots-fired: isn't serious or :commuter-rail-fire:
I thought people had a problem with the image. They have a problem that we have an emoji for coronavirus at all?
im vegan and find :meatballs: :meat_on_bone: :cut_of_meat: :venison_meatball: :thats-a-spicy-meatball: are offensive, delete them all.
Alright, well, I don't know what to tell them. It's an emoji, get over yourself
Like if the emoji had some kind of offensive joke image in it, maybe I would understand. But instead it looks like something out of your run of the mill virus movie/game
/roll 1d20 -1
I'll take that as the man in the moon kindly rejected my offer, but didn't hurl me into space to suffocate
i was just pasting it for myself lol
yeah, I got some serious flack for voicing that opinion <@UDC03KCGK>
I don't understand. Screenshot of any of the conversation at all?
This is just crazy and beyond me
human&gt; emoji or something like that
There's got to be more offensive emoji
OH MAN THERE'S MORE!
One sec this will take a while
I'm just glad we got rid of the abkhazia parrot.
Quick wikipedia is not making me instantly understand. Can you remind me what the problem is with that one?
its a separatist state that only Russia recognizes.
Alex Jones is the worst person:
<https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/ny-attorney-general-orders-alex-jones-to-stop-selling-coronavirus-cures.html>
He's a despicable person
So this is a different coronavirus emoji than originally
Not that the facemask one should be offensive either
was lunch free?
Are you done?
You missed the thread
There's so many
That's where I got the flak
I assume the last one?
I'm also technically in a meeting
I'll do it
I like Mark and Toby after this conversation
Also, are the coronavirus emojis not on Wayfair's slack anymore at all? and just exist here?
fin
<@UDC03KCGK> my understanding is that the slack update job does not look at emote deletion or updates, just creation. so if WF pulls down an emote, I don't think that will make it here.
Ah, I misread the line about the UN nations recognizing it. They recognize it as part of Georgia, not a separate country like Russia
Got it, thanks for the reminder!
Well, that whole thread is people not wanting to have a discussion. Which is super frustrating because it is the kind of people who would not want free speech limited.
I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but an emoji, especially of a virus, is just an emoji. It's like the word "numb." That isn't offensive until I call you "numb nuts."
Like I can understand the one with the facemask is cartoonish...but that makes it cartoonish, not offensive.
certain people get offended by everything today
like it's an emphasized personality trait
The holier than thou attitude is amazing
Didn't click through all the images, but were the threads included? there are some pretty good threads in that discussion as well
yea
it's a shit show man
OH MY GOD
HOW EVIL
just started pushing for security to review folding@home for use on wayfair laptops
let's excess GPU/CPU be used for research towards causes including COVID-19
ohhhhh fancy
this is ridiculous. is the argument still going strong?
this happened yesterday
I was late to refinement because of this
whats folding@home?
no but there were other humans around
<https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fhb5e4/coronavirus_specific_gpu_projects_are_now/>
Basically you donate extra computation. There are a couple big things that do this sort of thing. Folding specifically does protein research. 
got the idea from that
I think SETI also does a crowd computing project like that. 
oh nice
It's Friday the 13th!!!
Yup!
The realty agent I met with today noted that but said she thought it being St Anthony’s day was more than enough to cancel out any bad luck. 
you are vegan? Do you cook a lot for yourself?
realty agent?
I was re-signing my apartment lease.

I never really rented except that one time where I found my place on craiglist :)
No I was making it up ,:joy:

yeah
wow
Refinement?
scrum meeting where you estimate how complex tickets (work) is
Thanks for sending this. How is this going to work? Just do the guessing game and go through the registry?
Or some kind of webcast or something at 1pm tomorrow?
Just the guessing game and registry 
Nothing happening tomorrow at 1pm. They wouldn’t let me put a blank date or time. 
my roommate brought over her coughing boyfriend who she claims has had this cough since early/mid february
currently staying in my room
Soooo all the coronavirus!
Brilliant.
Where are you staying?
Well, I’ve had my cough since Jan or Feb, so I sympathize some. 
No
Just no?
Just no
No
Yes?
No
No?
I don’t know if there is a set roommate etiquette. Should it just be assumed that any roommate just gets veto over all visitors to the apartment?
Or maybe there just shouldn’t be any visitors?
Doug you're too naive
/roll d100
Who??
This is why I don't want romates
Roommates
I liked my old roommates, but I’m liking not having roommates too. 
Although one of them was a paramedic. I’d be worried about him being exposed. And then him exposing me. 
I've never really had roommates
Not even apartment mates?
I've never shared a room myself
How about growing up? I had to share a room with my brother. 
I don’t remember if you have a sister. 
He’s a only child 
College roommates, and then I sublet to a guy. And now mei
Shes kinda a pain in the ass
I did get a single in college. That was nice. 
I stayed and commuted to college and had a seperate room in grad school
My brother and I did share a  room for a very short time but he left for boarding school when I was 12
When we were very young, we would have our own rooms but most of the time parents would want us to all cuddle together. So it was four people on a king bed. Was cute. Now we too big.
<https://youtu.be/677mZ8LMoJM?t=131|https://youtu.be/677mZ8LMoJM?t=131> like so
That’s really nice. My family at least was never as close as that.

this is through the grapevine
anyone want to join me?
Time Out closed for the foreseeable future
due to Covid 19
They didn't give any specific dates, but from the fact they are going to pay the hourly employees based on their average hours for the next 2 weeks, it is safe to say it will be at least that long unless the situation drastically changes
Woah, see 2 week vacay
Good thing you didn't go to the ER!
That's great! (I mean, that they are paying employees).
Seriously though, what a waste of money that would have been
Also got confirmation that I will be getting paid as part of that due despite the quarantine. Closest to a paid vacation I'll ever see in the restaurant industry!
Yea!!!! PTO!
FYI for those who want to join i've made <#C0100JYKBME|stock-thoughts>
Quick info on documents:
If it is monthly, like a bank statement, fund statement, bill, etc. keep for a year
If you use one of these monthly things for tax deductions, keep them for 3 years
If it is investment related, keep the year end documents for the life of the investment plus a year.

City and state reaction. Restaurants must only serve take-out, public gatherings over 20 people banned. 
Yeah, you know, Dakota's mom's friend's son warning thing is looking much less like a random rumor and much more like oh shit reality...um, as of like 5 days ago.
Shit got real!
Very happy my wedding isn’t this or next month 
Well if you were having a wedding of just immediate family, you'd be fine!
excited that west world is back
bummer
yeah funny how it turned out to be good
Good morning monkies!
Good morning Victoria!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
You're a bad listener
Clearly it’s behind a paywall
Day 1 of the wayfair "quarintine" begins. Gonna be an interesting couple of weeks.
What does Thursday and Friday count as. The pilot?
Thursday was explicitly a test, and friday was to fix anything that went wrong
Lots of people, including myself, were in the office on friday
My department head told us not to come in on Friday. 
There were few people in office for us on friday
Yeah
I'd say about 1/4 of my floor was in the office.
someone is already going stir crazy and it's only day 1
and then our AD came on and said this might be way more than 2 weeks
NJ announced a state wide 8 pm curfew
Boston has a state wide 11pm curfew I think 
If anyone is thinking about refinancing, hold off. But I think everyone here is mostly renting though.
In mass, all the wedding venues are being ask to shut down. No gathering more than 25 people. My immediate family is so big. 
Do you have a link for the curfew?
Sorry it’s restaurant and bar curfew

Cool, thanks
I heard that they may do a city curfew 
I have to go to the hospital and risk it every week...
Updating the virtual baby shower link. It expired. <http://evite.me/h7dHmNS6fJ>
Parents and siblings and their spouses make up more than 12 people?
Your bar and restaurant curfew is out of date
That post and the article about Walsh for Boston were superceded by the Governor's orders. All bars and restaurants are restricted to take out only
man this took me a while to figure out
I don't try to unscramble the short ones for people
I don’t, I’m in the NU meme collective on Facebook and it was posted there
Ah, good stuff
There's guidance of not having groups of more than 10.... They be acting like I have 9 friends
They closed my apartment gym and lounge. It's tiny and can't fit more than four people.
yea but who knows what's touched it
<@UDC4QL95G> the last emote didn’t upload again. 
Good Morning! Day 2 of isolation begins
Or for some of us, day 1
One of my teammates was going stir crazy and I was like this is day 1 boy, you got 2 more weeks!
Oh god i would suck if you missed with your foot
Day 2? This is day 6 for me!
not our fault your a plague carrier
I don't even know at this point. I know I don't have symptoms, but there are plenty of people our age who have no symptoms but test positive anyway
and how would I know? The US is way behind on testing people
Sarcasm
oh, I guess its fine now
Good morning all; week 2 of isolation begins
???
Week 2?
We did work from home last week, at least one day. I think Dakota said he went back into the office on Friday(?)
I went out last weekend to see people, so I'm counting this as day 2 of isolation. although as mentioned we all may have different counts
I started WFH last tuesday
Oh man
:rollsafe:
You're like a whole 3 days ahead of us
I think doug and I are really the only ones in true isolation ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
because I have Mei?
I think i'd prefer true isolation
too late
I know that, but still, everything I said was true!
Yeah, i would probably be going crazy in true isolation.
anyone have any moble game recommendations, preferably with some sort of progression
antiyoy
anityoy
Dragalia
eternium
monument valley (1 and 2)
YMBAB (you must build a boat)
Hoplite
Night of the Full Moon. That game is a great slay the spire like. They've added microtransactions to it, so I hope the balance hasn't been ruined, but when I played it, they were effectively just cheat codes. You get 1 character for free and can buy the others, which is a fair model to me
And second Hopilite as a short time waster, but not as I'm depth
what??? there isn't really progression, but its a solid roguelike
I'm actively looking for a game that isn't a roguelike
as I want to make progress over this time of WFH
hot take: i almost just want to get covid-19 so I can get it over with
<@UETS9HTSS> did you see the COVID challenge?
yeah, it's dumb
Like the modern equivalent of the chick pox party. 
I feel like there's no chance I don't get it in the next year
Yes
so why not get it over with
Because waiting increases your odds of qualifying for care if you need it
I'm young enough that I'm not too worried
Right now they're going to be like go home bitch
You may want to wait until there is better treatment as well
Also reports of significant number of people who in China caught it, catching it a second time
So, that's fun
weren't they different strains?
Wait roll that back????
Catching multiple times is bad
Like... world ending bad
I think we found CJ's panic button
That's poor grammar
Not panic button, but like really think about the implication of you can catch this multiple times
This means that "Vaccine" they're praying on will never work
Which basically means that how you live your day to day reality is going to changed in substantial ways
It may work the way current flu vaccines work, you may still get it but not as bad
Ehhhhhh..... less than you think Victoria flu shots are generally not effective because there's multiple strains and then only immunize you against a couple of them
The stuff I was reading was saying that Coronavirus's tend not to mutate
yeah, the ones they expect to be prevalent that season
<https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-13/china-japan-korea-coronavirus-reinfection-test-positive>
Which says that our bodies are not figuring how to fight this, which means a vaccine to train our body is going to be way more difficult than a traditional vaccine
um- Daka? how could you?
Wait, do you not have roomates either?
Right, it's much more likely people are relapsing than recatching.  But if you can recatch in such a short time span this would be really really bad
LOL!
nope. none. zilch. no pets either.
Yeah, the way the article goes through it, we don't have a guarantee confirmation that people are catching it a second time or if the testing is just bad
False positives and false negatives, etc.
Have you talked about this before? Many of us have been over to Daka and Doug's and knew they don't have roommates.
I recall that she didn't have any
/roll 1d20 + 3.14
I haven't been to Daka's new digs I did not know he lives alone now
Yeah I haven't had people over since I'm basically as far away as drew is now.
How's everyone doing with isolation
Wish me luck, not only am I going to the city I am going to the hospital.
Installing Diablo 2 now, going to give that a spin. 
wash those hands!
Flattening the curve is very important though
:how-do-you-think:
<https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-amazon-suspends-all-non-essential-shipments-to-warehouses-2020-3|https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-amazon-suspends-all-non-essential-shipments-to-warehouses-2020-3>
When will my panic hit a ceiling
Is it not flattening the curve if he gets it, stays quarantined, and then recovers without putting any pressure on the health care system?
No because he still has the ability and risk of transmitting it to others
Good luck not touching your face. I fucking suck at it
Brenden would literally not be allowed outside of his room for 14-21 days in this scenario
installing diablo 2?
I may join this evening
and can probably provide a copy to whoever wants one
I'm getting a bit stir crazy because Sam is still working from home, so trying to give her the living room to stay productive, but that also means I spend most of my days in the bedroom, which is becoming my everything room, which is just not good for mental health in general
DUN DUN DUN!
there's only one outcome here
hunger games
Hide in the bathroom for a while, change of scenery
:knife:
I would say kitchen but that's pretty much in the living room
Took a while to understand your math, but I think you are right
Next step bundle and hide on the baloncy, wave at the people going by outside
Bonus if you use a lawn chair and look like a bum
If he is stopping the spread then he is flattening the curve, whether it's voluntary or because of a required quarantine
Ah gotcha.
He shouldn't be like 'i don't have it want want to so I get it over with' and go around licking things.
Oh man, if this sets into full on lockdown, that balcony is going to be a godsend to at least keep getting fresh air and being outside
my roommate opened the window for a couple of minutes and stood by it
it was quite amusing
Side note: redacted bot is less fun when it is a super common word like "it" "the" "or" along with today's word
we could take them out of contention for banned words
More like he doesn't flatten the curve by making himself a vector for infection, he just makes it worse
If you made a list
I would not be opposed to making it work
but I'm too lazy to make a list
can we call it our ban ban list?
I'd also like to make sure certain words don't make it on the ban ban list
can we keep a list of those
and have a ban ban ban list?
I really wanted to know how many times this thing grew for you Brenden. The "Ban ban ban ban ban ban list"
add words to the ban ban list on :thread: here
it
to
and
the
and
you
not
me
if
who
what
where
when
how
why
actually, should it be all words of 1 2 or 3 letters?
nah
yes and no are on my ban ban ban list
same with yeah, okay, nope, etc.
Does it though? I get flattening the curve, don't overwhelm the healthcare system. However, if you can properly catch it and isolate after catching it, you would be speeding up the cycle of the virus so we can all go back to our daily lives sooner
How's this bot work <@UDC4QL95G>? Did someone add the emoji and remove it? Does the emoji auto remove?
Ok
your
like
as
That's already a really good start
And what if he gets it bad? Then he goes to the hospital.
vetoing ok
Fine by me
ok, this is good to start with. locking down the list now. Once I have it connected you all can make changes to megamoji directly
Thank you for doing this
Ok, and what percentage of people not in healthcare under 35 go to the hospital for it who aren't immunocompromised or have prior lung problems?
My first thoughts when I heard flattening the curve were "Great, we're going to drag this out way longer then aren't we?"
Clearly I just don't get how it works entirely considering China did the same thing with some success
Also Brenden, don't you already have it because your roommate's boyfriend was around and almost certainly had the virus?
Yes somebody added the emoji and removed it
So about this extra copy <@UETS9HTSS>?
ok, should be connected now. new ban will happen normally tomorrow
Ah, so it is a sneaky person
ban ban list in a constants file
thank you Doug!
`y'already've't` is glorious
Glad it is easy enough to understand
I'm so glad I thought of this bot idea
<@UDC03KCGK> I hope so
Drew you're thinking about Brenden in a vacuum, he's not.  Say he catches it, then his roommates catch it because Brenden needs to cook for himself, or brenden gives to a random stranger when he needs to go shopping (say the cashier).  Brenden catching it makes him a vector and does not flatten the curve.  He would need to self isolate completely (which is almost impossible for him)
ALSO
bot list isn't working for me
"/bot list"
It broke
Womp womp
looking now
fixed
<@UDTR9SLN4> how did you get a phone number with your name in it? That's awesome

Yes, but I want to claim credit
Well Aysh, what do you do for fun?
Complete isolation is the one downside to living without a roommate or SO
additional variables will interfere with the experiment, we are working in a controlled environment for a reason
Like Sam and I talk about food planning and what items should be eaten first, etc.
I USED to dance.
I USED to socialize.
I USED to plan travel.
It was a different time.
you can still dance or _plan_ travel

<@UETS9HTSS> / <@UDL020K8D>  hexblade warlock advice :thread:
:hypereyes:
great way to make a MAD multiclass less MAD
(multiple ability dependent)
Starting at level 5 the rolls are
16
15
12
11
10
9
Aim the eldritch blast at the enemy
false
I was gonna go all hexblade
that's the only thing you don't do as a hexblade
if you're going all hexblade, what's your question?
I've only ever played Hexblad as a dip to boost a paladin
And I was thinking of half elf (2 cha plus 1 each)
so you're going to want thirsting blade and eldritch smite
then eventually relentless hex
What I can't figure out is should I go for 20 cha using the 16 +racial+asi
Or should I try to spread it out more
or?
to what?
put the 14 in dex and 12 in con
Or go 18 cha, 16 con, 14 dex for medium armor
use medium armor
go for 20 cha
use a shield
and a d8 bludgeoning weapon that's one handed
Right but should I max out cha first, or get the plus 1 ac. I could also go 15 for dex, and get medium armor master for +3 ac instead of plus 2 and only get +1 to con
cha first
So medium armor, shield, 1d8 weapon is a given
So get to 20 cha for the sweet +5 +5
yes.
if you have +5 cha, also consider maddening hex
K, that's what I wanted help figuring out. And I'm thinking pact of the blade and for invocations improved pact of the blade, antagonizing blast, and ???
Mostly because now I can shoot lasers from my weapon
And it also gets +5 +5
what gets +5 +5?
Eldritch blast as one of my cantrips
yeah, but you shouldn't be using it that much
otherwise why play a hexblade
Agreed but I don't know what I want for invocations
baby Nava is coming????? :heart:
improved pact blade
do the thing where you can get your EB up to a range of like a mile, then cry when no DM ever has maps that big
thirsting blade
maddening hex
relentless hex
eldritch smite
Yes, but she's being slow about it
that should cover it until level 9
Lol doug!
sounds like you're just agreeing to Aysh's name for the baby now.
So for level 5 thirsting blade, maddening hex, and eldritch smite?
what's your alignment?
hmm, I might wait until level 7 for maddening
Ha, Mei will murder me. No thanks
and take improved pact weapon
so you can bypass resistances
they start really becoming a thing around level 6+
Probably chaotic good, ain't got time for your laws! I'm thinking Link
but you could also ditch smite for maddening if you're into that
Right forgot improved pact
Makes sense!
Oh, wait, what? Didn't realize Mei was so close! Congrats! Tragedy looper tomorrow? :grin:
Navajoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo :heart:
name the kid javier just to confuse people
name the kid CJ to confuse people
Name her Lizard, call her Lizzie
What spells should I go after? The additional smites? And armor of Agatha?
Mei wasn't close they did this early, April 6th was the orginal date
I was aiming for a CJ junior mei was not having it
Good luck with it all today! It's all going to be ok in the end.
she pranked you!
valiant effort
Yes she did
As long as it’s not a April fool baby
If you're being induced now, I think it's safe you will not be having an April fools baby
So sad
Was a little worry that it was going to be a st. Patty baby
Unless you know how to time travel, you're probably safe from that as well
Been here since yesterday lol
Almost 24 hrs now
your spell slots should be going to hex
or smites
So, davidette is the name?
So don't bother preparing other spells, hex it or smite it
I was a few hours away from being born on April Fools
take hellish rebuke, as it breaks the action economy
Real question: does anyone have that name?
take shield because you can
look at counterspell
and thunderstep
Ok! Thanks!
replace thunder step with dimension door
look at banishment
Is it nap time yet?
and blight or sickening radiance
Yes, yes it is
I’ve heard Davida
Very successful! 3.5 hours!
Pictures to follow
Baby!!! Congrats you two!
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY congrats!!!!
Hooray! Congrats to you both! Here's hoping you'll be out of the hospital in the next 24 hours.
Did you ask if the blankets were womb temperature?
Congrats to Mei as well!
Congrats guys!

Honestly, I would think there would be even more emojis with how much time people have working from home now
Blankets were warmed
Better things to do at home than look like your working

I'm fairly certain dad jokes kick in when the kids can actually talk a little
Nah, they should start once you're a dad, and CJ here is now a dad
All he needs are cargo shorts, white socks and sandals, and a tucked in polo
Dammit, that should've been the baby shower gift!
Those are my favorite new ones
White "dad shoes" pristinely white could also be worn instead of socks/sandals
Just no.....
Do you have a choice? It's the Dad outfit, you are now a Dad (TM)
I'm a fan of the walking dead references. Even though I jumped off that show several years ago
Honestly, if I'm a hollywood exec, I'm canceling any production that I can that has a story core of a pandemic. People are going to be so over that shit after this
Orrrrr its gonna be the new hotness. Just like zombies were
I would doubt that, given how many people turn to movies for escapism. Also the more interesting disaster movies are about what worst case scenario could look like, and once you have an actual disaster of that type, it is just less fun to think about possibilities
"What if it was just like what everyone went through...but worse?!" is not a great pitch
are you guys still in the office and not WFH?
WFH
I actually don't even know if they'd let us in the office or not
nonwork everything is SO quiet
I'm not allowed in the office until the 31st
Everyone is quiet because they have other distractions
that's kind of counter-intuitive. I guess its the same as the emotes like Drew mentioned above
Bars and restaurants closed city wide until April 16th
even for take-out?
No, still allowed to do take-out
So more specifically, onsite for bars and restaurants closed till then
Mall is closed maybe through the hotel?
did you ever pick a name?
Nope
I don't think they'll let you leave the hospital without one
really?
BABY!!!
eh, just name it Jane Doe
AHHHHH BABYYYYYYYYYYYY HIIIIIIIIIII WE LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUU
Quick google suggests you can and have a bit of time on that. Sorry for the panic
....
Quick google suggests you can leave without a name. Sorry for the panic.
They plan on keeping mei and baby for 2 nights so no stress there
Too much panic these days
Right now its Lee baby Mei
Wow back to back scramble
Drew is drunk
I mean...I could
It's afternoon technically...
What does afternoon have to do with getting drunk
mimosas do exist
Yeah and so do Bloody Mary's.
ha
Anyway, baby! Thanks for baby photo.
NOW GO GET MEI FOOD!
What, didn't want to scramble that one? Would've been perfect
Mei already made me get her food from the caf, because she wanted warm food
I'm hearing drunk gaming celebrations!
Sam and I want to throw a party when all this social distancing stuff is over. We'll be out of food, but yeah, I have a pretty solid home bar still going right now.
A bit late, but congrats <@UDDE5960N> and <@UK7V13DS7>! Have fun with babby
so <http://battle.net|battle.net> is down
Booooo
Even the newer one?
:lolguy:
Guess overwatch, the new COD battlegorunds, Diablo3 are all off the table
Wow, SC2, SC, WC3, hearthstone
New cod (not even just battlegrounds)
And HoTS if anyone still plays that
Lol I played that for a bit. Mostly cuz it unlocked overwatch rewards
HoTS wasn't bad. It was easier to get into than LoL
Yea but they never did a good job keeping it going
in other news teamfight tactics just got released on mobile
Yes it did
Huh interesting. I watched a bunch of that when it came out. Kinda lost interest though. I prefer Hearthstones version of it personally
Generally pretty lazy when it comes to both
I played TFT once, I think I'm just not into the autochess thing
Temporarily? Or for an extended time?
unsure
back up
so definitely temporarily
Oh good!
yikes
<https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/488412-mnuchin-americans-could-get-two-coronavirus-stimulus-checks-within-9?amp>

wait, is the government just gonna send us $2k?
Pretty much
could
its not finalized yet
so we don't know the details
last concrete thing I heard was it might be for everyone making less than 130K a year
Huh pretty neat.
they did this in 2001
although that was about $300
So, in other news, just got confirmation that in the worst communicated way possible, me and all my coworkers were actually let go from Time Out
Text message?
So the 2 weeks pay thing is more like a severence
without those words actually being used concretely
I'm sorry to hear that
Funnnnn
That a real shitty thing to do
Will they be hiring after all the craziness
Maybe? It's super unclear
I assume their using weird language so they can bring you back when they reopen
I think that means you can get unemployement though, since you were not let go due to sickness
I believe that's the blessing in disguise, is I can collect unemployment against it
Sucks- sorry!
Also I'm not sure what other bars and restaurants are doing, so it might be a way for me to cleanly switch bars once they are allowed to reopen
Eh I see it as "hey, now you know what money you will be making in 2 weeks)
And a bonus 4k coming in the mail
It very much soured me on the place. I would probably sooner go back to Park than Time Out after all this
Gonna be honest, that is 2 months rent and that's about it
Park is probably doing the same
2 months rent out ot of nowhere is pretty good imo
<@UDC4QL95G> any cash from the government will take 3 weeks after they announce it to reach people
I got some friends back home where 2k is like 6-7 months rent
Well, that's kind of the problem: It means more to people in less expensive cities. It isn't adjusted to cost of living
True.
I think that is a matter of getting it out fast though
you can either pinpoint who needs it, or cast a wide net
Like, 2 months rent will be better than not getting anything. Just that the US response is shitty compared to even Italy where the rent and mortgage payments are suspended entirely
Eh i'd probably be sending it to my sister if I qualify for it anyway
Why? I can't imagine any place is doing something different. Or is the way you found iut?
Anyway, I'll probably be scrambling for any freelance or WFH jobs I can possibly come across in the next month or so
Shore Leave!
It's the cherry on top to terrible communication
Worst part, everyone will be
Got it
Gonna be honest, Shore Leave has crept up into a place I'd seriously apply to despite the hassle
Why???
They made a big to-do about paying people for the next few weeks, but then immediately at a meeting told everyone else that "Nope, you all lost your job. Still have some money, but here's an unemployment form" where as I couldn't be at the meeting due to quarantine, so I got a weird off handed email that said "Oh the meeting was about Covid 19 and what not. Also here's unemployment forms if you can't find anything else while we are closed"
Lol
Shore Leave is a really good bar program. Mostly on Tiki style drinks, but a good bar program is a good program and good for working my way up in the industry
Thanks Dave. How’s job hunting?
Yeah, you're right. And when the bars go back to hiring people again, there will be a flood of applications there too
Ohhh fancy and I imagine they make it a pain to apply so they only get dedicated people
Not really. They are a hassle to get to because they are in that part of the South End that has a good bit of restaurants but no T access
Unless you like the Silver Line
It would be a really hard commute for me
yeah, south end is weirdly underserved by transit
So, I'd have to bike, but even then, that's like a 45 minute bike ride on a good day. Then you add in the summer heat/humidity. Then being on for a 10 hour shift. Then biking back at 3am.
On days it rains, I would Uber, but that's not a cheap uber, and people don't go out usually when it rains, so it just becomes a really difficult day
Totally not biased at all, but you could take the green line to boylston and walk 12 minutes from there, or green line to copley then take the 9, which drops you off a block away
still 40-45 minutes either way
My current hypothesis is that people are slacking more with the people they work with directly (I know my team is)
That's only good one way unless they close before 12:30
That's only good one way unless they close before 12:30
looks like 1am
:hmm:
get a scooter like me?
(but in all seriousness, you do what's best for you; don't actually listen to me)
wheelie shoes
powered wheelie shoes
I think we can buy those in gloomhaven
theyre called rocket boots
valve index
It really sucks for everyone in the bar and restaurant biz
Sorry to hear how bad things turned out at your place Drew
I know I would be donating any government funds to something like the Boston Resiliency funds as being able to WFH and being unimpacted financially compared to everyone else.
It'll be ok, I appreciate everyone's response. I think it just hit me so hard yesterday the only thing I could do was like "Um, this happened and I'm upset"
I would totally take an excuse to get a boost board or one of those electric scooters that hits 28mph
Yea it blows. Just gotta keep truck or start a revolution
no one should be going 28 mph on a scooter; shits dangerous enough at ~20 mph
Not if you want live! Drew are you trying to tell us something?
I'm ready for the revolution honestly. Too much crap has just slid on by in politics now that I really don't think things will change until people just start marching in the streets
I'm seriously impressed you would do that. I totally understand people looking at an extra couple grand thinking "Great, thanks!" and be done with it
<https://www.boston.gov/departments/resilience-and-racial-equity> is this it, Chris?
Yea but you gotta start it!
Just make sure to practice social distancing when you march
Fuck that drew I demand you create the coughing corp at coughs on our oppressors!
That’s nice
There are so many restaurants that are doing their food for kids or family who need it right now. 
Random note but I can drink again!! 
Wait, this triggered on Mei?!
If we practiced social distancing, we would take up more space in the street though
It apparently can trigger when I add reactions
I'm changing that now
should be fixed now
<https://uscooters.com/>
Nevermind, 25mph. The person I talked to on the road said 27
I bought the Glion Dolly as it folds up and can be dragged behind you like a suitcase
you should also check if the city of boston has laws around scooter speed limits
Lol
Well that was unexpected bug
we tend to repeat the same basic triiger functions. They could be abstracted to make this situation less likely
I'll probably take a swing at it today
<@UHQD9J1SL> This is the one: <https://www.boston.gov/departments/treasury/boston-resiliency-fund>
thanks!
How's everyone doing this Friday?
Show baby
Baby shown
looks like a baby
Does babby have name yet?
Oh, that's a nice babby as far as babies go
Her name is Ashley Jane OKeefe.
hi babyyyyyyyyyyyy :heart:
That's a good name! Hi baby Ashley!!
So there is CJ and AJ
Aysh and Ash will be bets friends foreverrrrrrr
Ashley "Ash" "Nava" Jane O'Keefe
NOOOOOO BATSSSSSSSSSSSSS
/roll 20
lol i gamed it
Aysh conquers all bats
Lol
So April 27th
that's a thing
Wayfair is officially WFH until April 27th
<@UDL020K8D> <@UDC4QL95G> <@UDDE5960N>
im scareder and scareder
Damn son, that email just come out?
yeah
we're all going to get really good at video calls
Wayfair as a whole sucks at conference calls. It'll be interesting to see what it's like when I come.back
Saw this and had to post it
awwwwwwwwwwww thats cute!
Oh I already offered to bartend for Sam's video happy hour her co-workers are having. I mean I can only make drinks for her, but she'd have her own personal bartender!
My team has a discord channel going now
so fancy
Part of me wants to schedule every board game night possible once we can get past this thing. 
Part me knows I'll be working every night I can possibly get.
I saw a WF in prep to start all playing WoW. Subscription with pod outing money. 
"hey do you want the cut to go home ear..."
"NO! MAKE JACK TAKE IT!"
Huh, I really wonder if the restaurants and the rest of the city is going to follow suit. California just went on lockdown for the next month. So...I mean Massachusetts is worse off...
Well, once the restrictions are lifting I’ll probably never want to spend a night at home again. 
Well, if other people are around that’s probably ok. 
So...no video game party then?
Maybe. 
Yeah, I mean, people going to want sunshine and fresh air.
Jack..... that guy. *shakes head*
All future game nights at Doug's!!!
Great name, well done you two
It's nice to see how proud CJ is about your little girl.
Back to the original point: what drink can I make you next time you come out?
I am proud of my munchkin
She was good the whole ride home
Shirley temple with lots of cherries
Is munchkin Mei or AH?
Both!
She's a good baby
Midori sour with cherries ;p
<@UDDE5960N> isn't a Shirley Temple non-alcoholic? kind of defeats the point
Yes, but I'm sure you could add alcohol to one and it would be fine
you would be correct that is all she drinks normally
what's everyone up to today?
the fuck
<@UDDE5960N> <@UDC4QL95G>
Oh, that’s on me. 
I was messing with it. 
Also played some paladin on Diablo 3, I think I like it bette than Amazon. Now playing Doom Eternal. 
cant get steam to connect very sad
I turned off the birthday thing
yea steam magically worked!!!!!!
Thread triggers for &lt;3 people?
ever played speedrunners?
no
Midori sour would not be difficult.
Well, it wouldn't be difficult so long as I had the Midori. I don't keep it stocked anymore as my regular Malibu Pearl Harbor drinker broke up with her girlfriend and moved to Vermont.
wow, my company is having an update on wednesday, will be interesting to hear whats going on
```TL;DR - Starting this Thursday we're going to start scheduling a 90-minute block each workday, in addition to (not instead of) existing Flow time, called "Recess."  Please vote here for your preferred time slot; we'll announce the chosen slot in this week's Wednesday Edition, and send an invite around starting this Thursday.


What is Recess?  Similar to "flow" time, Recess is a recurring window during which we expect no Storefront meetings to be held.  While you can use this time however you want, the hope is that you'll use it for things like going outside, taking a break from staring at your screen, giving your partner a child-care break etc.  ```
Ahh classic wayfair, encouraging people to go outside during a quarentine
That's.... What everyone is saying you can do during these quarantines. 
They aren't strict quarantine like what people are used to
I mean is it a quarantine? Or a please stay home?
the latter
you're allowed to go outside if you don't come close to other people
unless you're sick
Every state is still keeping grocery stores and laundromats open for example despite being on "lockdown"
Isn't it "only go out if you have to"
Also, most health officials do say going outside is fine as long as you stay 6feet away from people and don't congregate
Speaking of lockdowns, Massachusetts is now on lockdown starting tomorrow
But they don't use those words.
Till April 7th

Daka beat me to it
thanks
so restaurants still offer takeout
that's all I was wondering
I was watching the video on that site when he asked
I’m so happy that I can eat the way I use to before!!!! Also I lost my baby weight hehehe
baby weight is such a weird term
people use it to mean fat gained during the pregnancy
but it feels like it should mean the literal weight of the small human growing inside you and everyone should lose that upon giving birth
thread for recommendations on accessible games to have my work team play remotely/virtually: :start_a_thread:
Summon the Silent
Jackbox Party Pack
One person shares main screen, the team plays on their phone
Codenames (show board with webcam)
2 Room and a boom, using discord
There is weight from the baby but also weight from pregnancy. Some people overeat or just gain more weight during their pregnancy. You are only suppose to eat 20% more calories for the pregnancy
Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (might need some sort of remote access app for this one though)
thanks for the suggestions daka
There is also that marble racing game that twitch streamers have been playing. players don't _do_ anything but it could be fun to bet on or make into a drinking game
just realized I have 9 pages of steam keys on humble bundle that I've yet to redeem
Icky verbs
So wait, Humble bundle just gives you keys with which you go get the game on Steam anyway?
That's nice
most of the time yeah
hi- if non-essential stores are closing, is there anything i should go get immediately or something?
not really. Grocery stores are still open so anything you can find there is good
my PM ran out to buy lightbulbs but i guess larger stores would have them
*larger grocery stores
You see the story in Pennsylvania about GameStop? They tried to declare them essential retailers, the state said nope, GameStop didn’t close, so the governor revoked their business license for the whole state. 
Wow.
Good
They deserve it
Good
Whose bot is that?
and what's the emoji reference from?
I believe the reference is the Zelda cartoon. 
The bot will look to see if a message text matches an emote and automatically add that emote. Ex:
Lol
Fire
Not sure why that one didn’t work. 
It’s snowing!!
That it is, though don't think any of it will stick
Wooooooooooooow
Emoji spam can hit anyone now?
currently, yes
But also probably one of the best comments for it to hit on
he brings you snow
he brings you nothing
Well, guess the bot isn't so sophisticated that it can parse out spaces, hyphens, and underscores
he-brings-you-ice
its looping over 27k emotes. I didn't want it to try too hard
bomme
it did ittttttttttt
<https://emoji.slack-edge.com/TDBEDSEQZ/bomme/accb1490bb6ed037.png>
Ok, now I have more questions than before
bomme means doll or toy and this is just something i think is very pretty so i created an emote for it  a year ago
That's fair, but I wish it could anyway
That answers them
Pylon
Ah, my pride and joy
weirdly the autocomplete list and the actual list differ a little bit. fire is an emote in autocomplete, but if you look it up slack doesn't think we have that emote.
maybe I'm only getting the custom ones? idk
someone sent this picture to me because i have a picture where im dressed exactly the same , and then i showed my mom and she bought  a doll and dressed it up like me - its embarassing but  sweet
That is sweet, and only a touch creepy

Can I get readers digest of the governors announcement? Wayfair felt the need to call me. :thread: pls
Dealing with baby issues :(
daw baby
Don't leave your home till April 7th...oh wait but you can go outside still, so continue not going to the things that are not open anyway
Essential businesses are still open: This includes take out, grocery stores, laundromats, and banks. Probably some other random crap like Pharamcies
Bot deleted my comment for no reason, didn't post anything else
Lol office is shut down now so.....
Trying this again: Essential business are still open like Take Out, grocery stores, banks, laundromats, pharmacies, and some other stuff like that
commenting
it might not trigger for me. you should try again, let me know if it still happens
Try here Drew :thread:
There once was a man named Jim
He got run over by a crane
Then there was a man named Tom
He lived to be 85 and died of natural causes
Then there was a woman named Sally
She took down the patriarchy
what the hell is going on in here?
I'm so sorry to all of you that got pinged to this thread. I forgot to silence chaos seed
I'm going to assume things are working correctly?
So far
i thought chaos seed only triggers for threads of &gt;2 people
that functionality might have changed in the bot refactor
LOL :test-in-prod:
She's ok, just some problems with keeping a good baby temperature. So she's on her way to the hospital to stay in a baby warmer
Thanks Drew
ok, I tried bumping it up to min three people in thread
oh!
Nah I thought we always had it ping no matter what just so people knew when big threads were going on
ok, back to any number of people
yeah it was always any number of people. There were suggestions in the past to bump it to a minimum number of participants, but it was never implemented nor agreed apon
Lol
Thanks drew
Good Morning all!
Good morning Drew! Hope your search for wfh stuff is going decent if not well
Good morning!

I don't know if I can take 18 months of covid19
its....18 months?
that is one estimate getting tossed around
like 18 months to a vaccine
According to a projection that the New York times got their hands on
And people are reacting like it is going to be good to be out and about again within the month because based on Italy "peaking" now, then the US would peak by mid April
The message I'm getting from this is that people are too soon reacting to good news coming out of Italy and a lot of people are going to die as a result
Yeah, but a few projections were talking about it coming in waves
I think the longer people are locked up, the less they care about killing people
Humans don't do well with enforced isolation.
wayfair updated slack but this one is the old interface and its weird
yeah, its pretty jarring
lol
i think it'll be interesting to see if china has a secondary outbreak
I still dont see the new slack ui
ah here it is
Wait, do you guys see it in this channel?

dunno
oh man this custom channel grouping thing is great
"show only new messages"

I'm surprised work is quiet
I'm working on this json transformation task that I'm really struggling to figure out.
Really? I would think JSON transforms would be easy ish. Or are trying to put JSON in structure format?
I'm trying to flatten json paths, splitting the json each time there is an array with objects in it. So the top level can need t obe copied by what's in the bottom level, so I have to recurse down and the back up afterwards? Formalizing the algorithm is turning out to be difficult. I feel like I'm inventing an arithmetic system for json.
Wouldn't that just be easier to do as a for loop and save all the info above. Down side is you'd have to know how deep to go. Yea flattening JSON is a pain if you're trying to save all the info in it.
A recursive function that passes higher level info into itself could work. Check if any element is an array, call itself else data dump
unfortunately not that simple
Booooo yea that sounds painful. Mostly because your not willing to lose info

nope. evil twin intimidates you instead.
Isn't that the point of evil twins?
thats the point of evil siblings
all siblings
evil twin is to fool others and make them think youre evil
so if all siblings thing the others are evil, I have two people who think I'm evil, and each think the other and myself are evil?
The moral is everyone is the evil sibling
Laughs in only child!

So, bit of positive news: went to claim unemployment.
A) Because Covid 19, I just get unemployment for being out of work, and so long as I can don't tell Time Out to fuck off, I don't have to actually pointlessly search for bartending jobs that don't exist. Just say "I am out of work due to Covid 19"...boom, done
B) Because it had not quite been a year, I am actually just reopening my unemployment claim from last year. Which means how much I am paid is based off of what I was making at Brigham...and Wayfair
C) In conclusion, Brigham and Wayfair are once again paying me for being unemployed, due to a virus that won't let me go back to work at Time Out
nice. Its a bad situation but I'm glad some system is trying to cover you
Thats actually kinda exciting!
Yeah, bit of a bright spot. It only lasts 2 weeks. At which point my benefit claim for the year is up. So I reapply I guess and get a lower pay because it is calculated on Time Out and Park...but then possibly get more than I am getting now because of the legislation they are trying to pass. Which they have 2 weeks to figure out before my old claim is up
right now (nothing signed yet) it looks like they are going to put more money into unemployment and send a 1-time check to anyone who made less that 75k in 2018
As long as they don't send it to everybody and i gotta worry about figuring out how to pay it back i'm fine
The 2018 part is weird, but it is all they have tax records for currently so I guess it makes sense
i'll be pretty pissed if they send me money and are like "yeah we are gonna want this back"
I think they should send it to everyone. Its possible they are missing some people whose situation changed from 2018
Better accidentally pay a rich guy if it means everyone who needs it gets it
you can tax him later
Were they sending this money expecting people to give it back or pay it back? My understanding was that wasn't even what they did in 2008
Just, here you go, have money
it was one of the proposed solution
no. no expectation of getting it back. I'm just suggesting that if people would be upset with the idea of giving money to people who don'tr really need it
Well, that's news to me. The current thing I read is what Doug is referring to and made no mention of returning the funds
i mean it'll probably get taxed as income so you'll pay one way or another
It just means that Daka is paying more than drew
Seeing as I usually just half-ass taxes. i'll probably get it wrong
Have you thought about an accountant, or a tax program?
Thought about it, didn't wanna have to pay an accountant when I don't have any complex taxes
I don't buy/sell stock so everything is super simple
Yeah, that keeps it simple. I learn a lot about taxes because my wife keeps doing things that make it more complicated every year.
Then this year I collected a week of unemployment, so that added to it
Yup i do none of that. IF i ever start doing that, i'll be hiring an accountant. Not sure how much they cost though
We had 6 W-2s between the two of us
Accountants cost a shit ton. If you ever think you need an accountant, ask how much, then tell me, and I'll do it for half.
really? what if I just go to like hnr block
I lucked into having tax professionals in the family. They just do it for me
```According to a 2019 survey, the National Society of Accountants says that you should expect to pay an average of $294 if you want to itemize your deductions on your tax return. Before you gulp, you can take some comfort in knowing that this generally includes both your state and federal returns. The average fee drops to $188 if you don't itemize, which tells you something about how complicated and time-consuming itemizing your deductions can be```
since I use credit karma for tracking my credit score, I use credit karma tax for my taxes
HNR block is more of like tax help for people doing really simple stuff and just don't get it.

Well at least you all saw it in live time
Really would like to know which bot is causing it
unfortunately the logs only go back so far, and _somebody_ decided to spam
The fact it hit Dakota and that the scrambler just worked in main makes me think it is not a bot specifically against me
yeah it did hit me once, so something is up
I'm turning bots off for a little bit
or run a personal business
I turned on a couple things. nothing that deletes/replaces messages. I'll give it a day and see if the issue resurfaces. if it doesn't I'll turn on a couple more
No, not even
Sam's freelancing is a personal business, and you ust report it as a schedule C company and deduct the business expenses directly from there
still itemized deduction, just against the C corp rather than personal
Yeah but it is an itemized deduction you can take IN ADDITION to the Standard Deduction
Along with some weird "You're a business, have 20% off, just cause!" deduction
Thanks. Sounds like a good systematic way of testing
Oh, and btw, today is Day 14.
Didn't get Corona in Paris.
So quarantine over tomorrow morning! Just in time for...Massachusetts Lockdown
I'm going grocery shopping though. Fight me
HOW IRRISPONSIBLE!
all the silver linings!
It's allowed under the current order. I'm simply pointing out that worrying about me bringing back corona from Paris was not the case in the end
I'M NOT THE VECTOR
&lt;4, 5&gt;
I was never worried about you bringing cornoa back from paris. I was worried about you bringing cornoa TO paris
i was also just trolling you
I was mostly trolling you, and like 5% playing it safe by not seeing you for 14 days
And that the government will force screen/ quarantine you on re-entry
Um, but they didn't. That was the problem
GOOOOOOD morning!
Good morning aysh
Good morning!
goooooobbbbyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Goober!
cuddling newborns is a lot of fun
but maybe mine is just a really chill baby
im looking forward to meeting her in....X months :slightly_smiling_face:
what were people's first board games? Do you remember? I'm pretty sure mine was Candyland (maybe its not technically a game? oh well)
The first one I remember playing is Monopoly, but I'm sure I was started on others
shoots and ladders
another classic not-actually-a-game. I forgot about that one. so frustrating
:dk-taunt:
hm, both robin_williams and good_morning_vietnam failed to load. interestingly that is also a robin williams one.
that is odd.
they still exist in wayfair

Voodoo Daka!!!! Voodoo, black arts, evil magic, terrible consequences!
Also how are people enjoying work? Taking care of a baby doesn't seem that bad
Meh. the days are all starting to blend together
What's a weekend vs. a normal day. Feels the same way over here
Weekday: Wake up, sit at computer, go to bed.
Weekend: Wake up, sit at computer, go to bed.
CJ, are you on paternity leave?
I'm concerned about the lack of eating in this schedule
Yes
Yes more sleep
it's not an exhaustive schedule
there is a lot of killing time in the "sit at computer" step
Lol
I feel like it's more fun than killing time at work
can you take emergency caregiver PTO instead?
Why would I want to do that?
extra time to care for baby?
Very strict about that being a hard no. I'd have to prove the baby is in distress
ah ok
someone on my team took 2 days pff because her wifi was down
Please include eating time
Most Americans will get a one-time payment of $1,200. And families get an extra $500 per child. If you make above $75k, you won't get the full $1,200, and those making above $99k don't qualify. The gov will decide how much to give you based on your gross income from your latest tax returns
hmmmmmmm
i wonder what joint filing looks like
man that sucks for people in entertainment. You might make nothing now but get fucked scrub
i wonder how many people with equity would be mad
Currently thinking about moving in August. Thread for asking opinions on where I should live :start_a_thread:
Silence Chaos Seed
Here are a couple of regions that look promising:
&gt; Back Bay
&gt; South End
&gt; North End
North End is great.
&gt; Assembly
&gt; Wellington
&gt; JP
&gt; Beacon Hill apartments on the market right now look run down, so ehh
Honestly, Wellington seems pretty appealing and available (there's a bunch of complexes that seem to always have availability)
If I could find the right place, I'd rather be closer, but having my rock gym on my way to/from work could be good motivation
Similarly, I'd be in walking distance of Night Shift/Short Path
beacon hill looks lovely to walk through, I have no idea what their apartments look like.

North End had some real duds when I was looking around here, but I've very happy with where I ended up. and there is a rock gym by North Station

<@UHQD9J1SL> lives around Wellington.
It's $150,000 for joint filing
Aysh, what kind of place do you live in?
How do you like the Wellington area?
ahhh nice
I live in Wellington and I really like it, Its incredibly convenient. Orange line can get crowded but seems a lot more reliable than other lines. All your essentials will be covered withing a 1 mile radius
Do you have a car?
Do you feel like you need a car?
I did have one till october and turned it in since I didnt use it at all
there is a long skybridge from Wellington station to the actual neighborhood that gets really cold in the winter, fyi.
the skybride is like, .4 miles on one side and 300 ft on the other. it can get cold but it wont be snowy/ slippery
Wellington being one stop from assembly seems nice
the commute to work is longer though. not sure how much commute times matters to you.
wellington seems like it'll be a 25 minute commute
does that seem accurate <@UHQD9J1SL>
there are running trails byy the mystic river, there's a park nearby. commute will be ~20 minutes in the train itself.
youll need to go elsewhere to keep trying  bars/ clubs / restraunts . options are limited
lol I barely go out in Back Bay
I tend to go elsewhere already
Back Bay has a shitty food/bar scene
where is the best bar scene in boston?
separate thread please
<@UETS9HTSS> where do you consider the bar scene in Boston to be good/best? :start_a_thread:
I honestly don't tend to think of it as a whole for a neighborhood except when they're a void.
What are you looking for in a bar scene?
That'll determine my answer
idk, I was just interesting when you said Back Bay isn't very good, I was wondering where you liked?
Most of the red line is pretty solid
David/Central/Quincy/Porter is good for restaurants
I was going to guess Davis
places like Back Bar would be on my list for a good bar
brick and mortar
art science cafe
downtown boston is a mix of stuff except for the north end/chinatown
Im in station landing apartments, they have $1k/ 12 month lease off for wayfair employees .
I have TJ, Wegmans, Aldi within a one mile radius.
Target and Costo 1.5 miles.
Marshalls, TJMaxx, Kohls, and the entirety of assembly 1 mile radius.
Starbucks/ cold stone/ CVS and walgreens are 1 minute away
Mystic river offers a nice place to take walks / run
Apartment has a mini gym and lounge to watch TV / play games in (usually, theyre closed now)
Commute can be between 30-40 minutes (including the walk from apartment to station, station to actual desk)
Instacart and amazon fresh, uber eats, doordash etc all work here
There is a zipcar behind the apartment if you need one for weekends or something
Ive taken ubers at 4 am to go to the airport so its pretty close to the city
Somerville has nice places to eat and bakeries I believe
north end is very specific, as is chinatown
oh. Urgent care .5 mile away. Came in very hand at one point
shore leave (chinatown?)
blossom bar (brookline)
longfellow bar (harvard)
baldwin bar (woburn)
stoddards (park street)
40 minutes is slightly more than I was hoping
I was hoping to cap out at 30
I can walk to work in around 30 (through the park even)
South End has a good restaurant scene but it is impossible to get good public transit there
Well maybe not impossible so much as convoluted
yeah, you need to walk or take a bus
but there's definitely interesting stuff down there
Sam and I looked at North End, but it was kind of prohibitive due to lack of a proper grocery store. You can get stuff from all the specialized italian markets, but you'll be paying for quality constantly, which can be expensive
North Station now has that Star market
that used to be true, but has know changed
That's good to hear
there is also a whole foods not to far past it in the West End
I still found finding apartments there difficult.
but that Star Market in TD Gardens is a true game changer
<@UDC03KCGK> totally feeling you there.
40 minutes would be like if you JUST missed a train and if someone is standing in the door at every stop and not letting the doors claose
Shore Leave is South End, along with Toro, Masa, Wink And Nod
Park Street you also have Yvonne's
If you want to get pedantic, Back Bay technically includes the Kenmore sq area, where you have Island Creek, Hawthorne, and Eastern Standard all right there. Plus I found Lolita's to be solid
But then outside of that, the rest of Back Bay is more dive bar and Irish pub crowded
Also downtown you have Mariel.
TL;DR Doug:
Downtown
South End
Kenmore Sq.

Everywhere else you can find a good bar or two, but I wouldn't classify it as a good bar scene as an area
Oh, closest to where you live Doug is a very small bar called Sound Advice, above the Arc Light Theatre there at North Station. Worth checking out since you live right there
in the TD garden complex?
Assembly is really nice, you'll just pay a premium for all the housing there.
I think Wellington might be your best lead since you can get really nice luxury apartments in the Wellington/Malden area, but unlike Malden, there's actually stuff to do there
Kind of. It's at the end of it. You go into the theatre, go up to the 3rd floor by elevator, and then it is immediately on your right. It's truly a tiny bar. But also brand new, and the menu was consulted on by Death and Co who are one of the top bars in the entire country (out of New York, their cocktail books are what most cocktail bars in the city assign as study materials)
when things re-open you'll have to guide me there. now I'm worried about getting lost in there
Can do
I'd like to join for such an excursion
That would be fun. I highly enjoy going out to cocktail bars with friends.
ill tag along :slightly_smiling_face:
This one seems fairly promising
<https://www.gables.com/communities/massachusetts/medford/re150/>
I doubt it's very close to the station. Do they offer shuttles to the station then? I've seen it and the community itself is great looking (from the outside). What's your budget?
yep, they do
I'm currently paying $1750
I'd like to maintain or ideally reduce that
Without roommates?
with roommate(s)
currently looking at a 2 bed/2 bath
so max of $3500/month for that
Ah station landing and modera would also fit that . And Avalon assembly
No wait I take that back. It would be just over
for all of them?
I'm seeing options for 3480/3550 in station landing
:hmm: I think I'd have to pass on that; re150 looks like it'll be 3-3.2k
I turned the emote spam down a bit
I'm glad
it was pretty prevalent
it was 1% of messages. we just post a lot.
now half a percent
Holy crap it's friday. Morning
Morning! What have you been up to Daka? We haven't heard from you in any of the online gaming get togethers
Would think that would be up your alley
Morning
hows life daka?
I was shocked to find out today was friday
That's either working too hard or hardly working
Something about sitting at my desk all day working, then not moving to sit at my desk and play games is just not appealing to me. I've been burning my brain out after "work" with basically nothing but twitch and youtube, and xbox with friends from chicago
Nah it's a problem with my play environmenet and work environment being exactly the same thing
Move the laptop for work to the living room. Then go to the bed room for games
That would mean giving up having 2 monitors for work, which I am not willing ot do
Move the monitors too
You're gonna be there for another month
That would involve losing 2 monitors for using my PC, which I am also not willing to do
Sounds like I know what you're ordering
Monitors are too expensive. IF way fair was paying sure, but it's not worth it
You can buy a couple cheap panels for like $100 each
exactly. too expensive
...so about that $365 in ones transaction we talked about to save you having to waste any time at the bank
Your friend has had no one to help him out with bus fare for the last month
In a stunning turn of events, our interm CEO decided to keep almost everyone wfh, so home I stay
They're also creating plans just incase this lasts a few months...so much fun...
Hooray!
Do you still get paid or you having to do the unemployment thing too?
How many monitors do you own?
As I can do the majority of my job from home, I get paid. It just means once we're back in office, I get to do weeks of backwork
3 I am willing to use
Ok. So if you move one to the living room, you have a laptop screen and a monitor. That's 2 screens for work, and 2 for playing games. You don't need 3 monitors to play LoL, Diablo, and certainly not for Unrailed
Also does Overcooked play online?
Overcooked 2 might
Uff da. Less fun. But you have money and not going to go into a biochemical warzone. So silver linings?
Yeah, I consider myself lucky
I have a lot of friends who lost their jobs because of covid
Yeah, Overcooked 1 definitely doesn't
Boo
But if someone has Overcooked 2 and can confirm it has online play, that would be something I can probably easily justify buying
Yup, it certainly sucks. So far most of my coworkers seem to be doing better than expected despite the mass layoffs
I love this bot, thank you <@UDL020K8D>
Yea tons of back work is worth not being around people right now
I have it but the switch is dead... I'll try to charge it at some point
Lol
I only have so many outlets under my desk, and I guess the switch charger didn't make the cut
Well then you need more/better splitters
Yeah, you my friend need to buy some surge protector strips
OH I have them, but I'm hesitant to use 2 strips off of a single outlet
Fair point. Also means you have ridiculously small surge protectors then
I'm currently using one that has 8 plugs
what you need is the ones that rotate so that big plugs aren't an issue
Fancy emojis
My company is doing pay cut so we don’t have to do layoffs
thanks
That's good. Reminder my job was in the restaurant industry, where everything shut off. Mass layoffs were kind of industry wide.
BUT WE SET RECORDS! ....of people collecting unemployment
hi. is everyone ok? why have you all abandoned everyone else? :disappointed:
i snorted
haha
spongebob-mock
Darn it didn't work
i made a meme about one of my sister teams. but my manager manages that team. i have no one to share it with.
what a stroke of brilliance
So it's a mean meme?
spongebob-mock
Reactivated the bot
Also it's like super nice out
I have it off currently. testing bots to figure out why threads were getting deleted
I turned it on, since it has no deletion capability
Share it with us?
Also playing with baby
how's the baby doing? :slightly_smiling_face: hows  the mommy?
wait, did you change the meme to be spongebob, or did I accidentally guess correctly
so <@UDC4QL95G> how have you been spending your quarrantine?
Some Xbox, lots of youtube, that sorta thing
what games on xbox?
Descenders, Ori and the Will of the Whisp, Dead Cells
Some Halo Master Chief Collection
i said it after you tried the spongebob mock
#nonwork-politics
&gt; the democratic nominee should pledge their supreme court nominees won't come from an ivy law school. Everyone currently went to either Harvard or Yale. Stanford used to have some representation but no longer.
I get that diverse backgrounds are desirable for diversity sake
but why does a meritocracy fail in this scenario?
or is it because this is a purely political appointment?
When you have 200 options all within episode of each other for line 1 or 2 spots, it can make sense to consider other factors. The marginal difference is t worth it at that point. 
i dont understand what Doug said, but that statement (that Brenden posted) stood out to me as reeking of jealousy
ok, so image you can rate how good someone would be on the court, from 1-100. clearly you want to hire an 80 over a 20 (meritocracy). But there are so few spots open on the court, and its such a prestigious job that you can take your pick between 99.3, 99.4, 99.7, etc.

at that point, choosing between highly competent people, the marginal differences between them are not really as worth looking at. Instead you can look elsewhere to make the decision, like trying to increase diversity, etc.
(trying to explain my previous post)
There is separately a real benefit to having the populace believe the government is well representing them. People railing against costal elites contribute to the diminishing lack of trust in government, leading to large-scale collective action failures like we're currently witnessing.
is ivy leage the right attribute to pick on for the diversity pick?
I might actually bring this up in that channel
Pledging to increase the diversity as suggested wouldnt do anything to actually increase diversity along the 5 protected classes. I dont think school-elitism is an equivalent
I've read some legal scholars suggesting that is it important. I can't really speak to it myself, but people I've trusted say yes.
This also does not have to fight against diversity in the traditional protected-classes sense. you can strive for both.
'a nice populist message that might work'

This is why people get called diversity hires even if they deserve the jobs!
Well, the reason schooling would matter is that every University has a different teaching style and philosophy. So while those schools are prestigious, you are getting a biased view of ethics by going from the same schools
Even for a position as judge where you should be unbiased. Clearly that's not the case though
Good Morning!
Good morning! :upside_down_face:
Good morning!
good morning
Good morning! Anybody doing anything for the weekend?
Staying inside, avoiding all the peoples
pretty much the same, what are you doing drew
Done a lot of chores, exercised, and going to watch reruns of a famous tennis match
lol
;p;
i cuddle with a baby
Played some video games earlier. Kind of lightly napping now. 
Watch some tiger king over Netflix party yesterday. That show is the most batshit crazy thing ever. 
It is the best show, so many unexpected turns
I’m only like half way through. Already more twists than I ever could have predicted. 
I'm gonna start it tomorrow!
You’re in for quite the ride. 
Has anyone been given or seen some old American puzzle called "One Tough Puzzle"? 
It's like a 9 piece jigsaw puzzle, but some bs about 300,000 possible combinations but only 1 solution. 
I solved it...but I didn't really feel like I did an actual logical solve to it. More of got lucky is how I felt. 
Found answers online, but no explanations on HOW to solve, so much as, this is the solution, be done. 
And what I can find of explanations are people who went "I solved it with a computer algorithm!"
Is there more to this thing that I'm not just seeing? Or more of a "More of a fuck around till you get it puzzle."
That tends to be true of jigsaws in general
Jigsaws are pretty much fuck you, your bored. Or the first genetic algorithms
Alright, well, good to know there shouldn't be much to expect from it.
Morning All
I got a question in slack today and as I was thinking of an answer, my PM swoops in an says I'm on PTO for a couple days and will answer later. which really confused me. turns out that while the azores trip was cancelled, I forgot to cancel the PTO in workday. :stuck_out_tongue: I was probably going to ask for tomorrow off for my birthday anyway, so I'm just going to roll with this.
your birthday is postponed doug
Ah, good to know. 
Does anyone else here use Gmail?
Yeah
For personal not bad. Still despise it for work
yeah I do as well, though mostly that involves reading subject line notifications on my phone
I use for both work and personal
though I'm on g suite for both
Can everyone test whether they can click on their avatar in the upper right corner and get the sign out options?
On either Gmail or <http://google.com|google.com> homepage
Yes I do
Weird. I can't switch profiles or sign out. On two separate computers
And different browsers

oh hi there AJ!!!
she looks like CJ?
I mean, is it surprising? CJ is her dad
more CJ less Mei?
Really I think she looks more mei
To me, she just looks like a baby
thats definitely accurate
I was more just saying, her possibly looking like CJ wouldn't be surprising
It's those pinchable cheeks!!!!
she's a cutieeeeeeeee
Brenden- whatre your quarantine comfort snacks&gt;
Bhuja crunchy seasoned peas
chips/salsa/guac
are they like wasabi peas?
I'm having to do an anti-malware scan for the first time since like high school
check your chrome extensions
bad chrome extensions are an easy vulnerabilities
I had some old extensions in there and got rid of those just now. Hasn't fixed it yet but could have been the vulnerability
What do people here who have PCs use for anti virus and malware/spyware?
Windows Defender
You know, I'm honestly kind of surprised you don't
Why? Antivirus software is basically just bloatware
It's not too hard to avoid sketchy downloads :lol:
:this:
antivirus is mostly awful
if I downloaded something that it says is bad, I'm probably going to override it anyway
and it doesn't scan the places I'd actually get hit
like chrome extensions
And any really dangerous malware is going to know how to avoid all of the mainstream virus scanners
Anti-virus is like anti phishing, it generally comes down to the user letting bad things it
hence why people call things like norton and macafee malware
_macafee_ :gross_blob:
If I had to pick one to download right now, I'd probably go with malwarebytes, but i'm not sure if that is still any good.
yeah, same
I haven't needed to do so in so long I'm not sure if it's still relevant
Well, I'm running out of options
unistall and reinstall chrome
At a certain point it is a network issue, and I'm not at all sure what to do there. I checked to make sure there wasn't an unfamiliar device on the network but that's as far as I got
wait, so what specifically is your issue?
I can jump into discord if you wanna screen share
Or a slack call :lol:
I'm trying reinstalling Chrome, and then I'll check back
If It happened on multiple different browsers and different computers, My guess it is user error
Alright, I'm on discord
My industry is not doing well either. Heard a lot of consulting firms have to lay people off too.
I want one too lol
Happy not yet your birthday Doug!
Happy (not your) birthday!
Yeah, happy Tuesday Doug!
Why is this channel LESS active than when people were going to work instead of wfh?
Like, it isn't that this channel depends on life experiences to thrive. We can make a 200 post thread over the topic of Dave's opinions on fantasy books.
less pressure to look like you're working?
idk
Like, I'm ready to plow through Bioshock and go "Look I know the discussion about this game ended like 10 years ago, but I just beat it without significant spoilers for the first time (10 days from now) ever and dammit I want to talk about it!"
i never played
so I can't contribute
But now you can play it and talk with me about it!
And you'll have someone who just played it for the first time too!
the first bioshock? Are you planning to play infinite as well? its pretty worth it
I plan to. It gets pretty cheap during steam sales. Whenever the next one ends up happening
I've just heard I can completely pass on Bioshock 2
I've been playing Doom eternal recently. Actually pretty dissapointed in it, the 2016 Doom was soooo much better.
never played bioshock 2
Mind you, for those who didn't know, this list currently includes:
Witcher 3
Bioshock
The Last of Us
Uncharted 3
God of War 3
Deadspace
Deadspace 2
Metroid Prime 2
Metroid Prime 3
Shadow of War
Civilization 6
StarCraft 2 (campaigns for all 3 and then some online matches against <@UDDE5960N>)
The new God of WAr is much better than the orig trilogy
Oh and a replay of Prince Of Persia Sands of Time because I think Sam would enjoy watching that in the same way she enjoys the Uncharted franchise
Don't have a PS4 though
I'll get to it when I buy one for like $100
oh, I thought Last of Us was ps4 only
It's PS3 originally
Then was ported
oh, right
The story on Sands of Time is great. I've not looked back to consider if the graphics hold up at all
I would love to play metroid prime 2/3
I'd play civ6
witcher 3
god of war 3
last of us
feel pretty meh about the rest
i dont get it either. its true of all the nonwork channels in wayfair slack too
Metroid 2 is a little odd but still worth playing. 3 is great. 
oh wait, is 2 echoes?
Yes
if so I already played that
haven't played 1
2 is the light/dark one. 
1 is very good. Hence they made 2 more
solid game though; would replay
Metroid 1 might be the best of the three. 1 and 3 are close. 
need to find an emulator
what I really want is an emulator for the PS3 SSX
SSX?
that's one of my favorite games of all time
yes
love that series
(snowboarding)
I really don't care about graphics. Hence the Diablo II replays
I care about graphics to an extent
but it's not my priority
Good graphics are nice, and appreciated, but by far unnecessary to a good time for me
This is why I really don't care about say Journey. Beautiful....exploring sim? It's missing the gameplay aspect for me. And possibly story...though I haven't got through it ever to understand if it even has a story
Yeah, I was a big fan of SSX Tricky
the ps3 version lacks true multiplayer (online asynchronous is okay, but not ideal)
but is based upon real world mountains
and has added items like wingsuits
I loved Journey. 
I see it less as a exploring sim and more of a faith simulator. 
And the first two witcher games are on there because I am just almost incapable of playing a game without having played the earlier entries. 
The deadspace games are on there because of my brother
Uncharted and Sands of Time because Sam (plus I like both)
StarCraft 2 because I've loved StarCraft since the first time I spent 4 hours playing it at a friend's house back in 2000
I want C&amp;C Generals remastered
That's weird...
If you like Deadspace, you should look into Prey. It will legit make you afraid of coffee mugs. It’s great. 
Maybe because slack is an entertaining outlet when stuck at work, but when you need that outlet at home, you just go to something you would do at home
I heard alien: isolation is a great horror game
people say that the alien's AI is scary good
you feel hunted
Heard the same thing. Problem is:
I started Deadspace when I was in the phase of playing everything on hard difficulty
In the absolute dark
Alone
I can't go back. However I have very few of those moments to play in my life where I don't risk either waking up Sam. Or giving her nightmares.
And playing on an easier difficulty takes away so much. Because part of the environment is the total lack of ammo. The constant "must react fast, but also make every shot count"
Have you played Horizon Zero Dawn?
I think is ps4 only as well. 
yeah it is
I’ve played it. It’s great 
Fun gameplay, and awesome graphics
it's based on content, you think about it, with me one of the vocal contributors busy cuddling my baby I produce less content.  That means less for others to feed off of
generally when we're a work we need to do something to look busy, slack is an easy way.  When we're at home we literally just do other stuff
Games I want to play at some point:
Persona 5
Sekiro
Outer Worlds
Bloodborne
Nier Automata
Me and a buddy co-oped dead space
I’m starting a replay of Prey right now. The intro is one of the all time greats. Such a creepy way to start a game. 
He loved watching me scream DIE MOTHER FUCKER DIE!!!!!!
I also had to beat the first level on the hardest difficultly so he could get to the bench
I always felt like I should try to beat the dark souls games at some point
But I'm too lazy
I hate dark souls. But sekiro was awesome. 
I played the hell out of dark souls 1. IMO you have beaten the game when you get to the double boss. The rest of the game is just a grind
Play sekiro 
Drew did you ever play fallout New Vegas?
<@UETS9HTSS> game with sense of progression that's pretty cheap, mindustry
Oh, that looks cool. 
`cross-platform multiplayer and large-scale PvP unit battles.`
that's the intriguing part to me
If Civ 6 is on there, I'm going to recommend Rimworld instead.  6 Doesn't seem as good as 5
looks a lot like factorio
It's open source if you really don't want to play
I got it for like 3 bucks during a steam sale
it's a tower defense game though
The multiplayer is a little wonky because they don't have match making
which I don't think factorio is
Factorio but with a larger emphasize on attacking or defending
I'd have to agree about civ 6
don't know rimworld though
Factorio always kinda missed it with me because the purpose was always build a bigger factory which seems... kinda like my job
Factorio you do get swarms of enemies that come after you as you pollute the planet, and you can fight them off with towers, but it has way more emphasis on the factory part
Rimworld and Civ6 are entirely different categories of games
But are they?
Yes
You can totally classify Rimworld as 4x
4x?
Alright no exploration
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X>
"eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate"
also no eXterminate
You can exterminate, raiders or even other towns
those are infinite and procedurally generated
which is not true at all for civ games, where the entire world is created on startup
Also civ is turn based
Fineeeeee
thats like saying cod and fallout are the same kinda game because you shoot people with guns
I still say it tends to scratch the same itch for me
Ehhhhhh, more like COD and BL for me
I am not a fan of Civ 6. Huge fan of Rimworld
But I can get some people wouldn't get the same satisfaction
Compare Xcom to COD then
That's not even the same play style!
NETHER IS RIMWORLD AND CIV
Would you compare xcom to Rimworld
turn based vs real time survival
XCOM IS CLOSER TO CIV
turn base vs. real time is a minor difference to me
Why would you think that?
:sideeye:
that is like... the number 2 difference
RTS vs turn based strategy are very different
A game being turn based is as big of a difference as third person vs first person
or 2d vs 3d
would not compare C&amp;C to civ
Sc2 vs civ are wholly different games as well
Real-time vs turn based is huge. 
Also don't care about 1st vs 3rd
Civ 6 I already bought and since the only civ game I can compare it to is Civ Revolution, I'm sure I'll be fine with it not being as good as Civ 5
And thanks for the reminder: XCOM is also on that list
Just don't have a PS4
Isn't uncharted ps4?
I'll get one eventually, but adding those games to my list doesn't make sense until I actually procure one.
Uncharted 4 is PS4. Specifically listed Uncharted 3
These are all games I ALREADY OWN btw
OH lol i didn't realize that
Ohhhh if you haven't played SPAZ I would recommend that
Well, I lied a little. Don't own the first 2 Witcher games, but I do own the 3rd, and now that I've watched the Netflix show, I feel compelled to get the first 2 and play them first.
Also estimate of hours to complete the first 2 are...not unreasonable
I basically just play what comes up on Xbox Game Pass.
Currently playing Ori and the Will of the Whisps
It blows my mind that you own all of these games and haven't completed them, and want to
I loved the first ori game. Haven’t gotten to the second one yet. 
my monitors are out for delivery as of 4am and I'm sitting here like:
Random question, is there a way to turn off notifications for certain threads, don't want to be off chaos seed, just don't want notifications sometimes
Yes, you can unsubscribe from threads
or opt out temporarily
How do I do that on mobile?
oh yeah also that. /chaos will update chaos seed in real time
I want the chaos seed notifications, just don't always care about the threads I'm pinged on
then unfollow threads
open thread --&gt; 3 dot on parent message
Cool, thanks!
Just trying to figure out productivity at home
Morning 
Probably being distracted by being home already 
check your mail!
just backed the frosthaven kickstarter
What mail?
Think of how many times I am at game night or at work. Then factor in how many times I've had to switch or search for new jobs. Then factor in I want to spend time with Sam.
Comes out pretty simply a lack of time when it gets down to it.
That and spending a lot of free time watching the latest movies (back when going to the movie theatre was a thing) and youtube
No i get life is busy, games are how I know I could be addict because I will move things to make it happen when I get hooked on one.
packages
This, so much this.
I'm the same way. I'm not a substance addict. I am definitely an addict though to media
`thinking-but-i-cant-touch-my-fac` lol
I'm a big fan of that one
Once all this "no face touching" thing started coming out i tried to pay attention to how often I touched my face
Turns out 99% of the time my hands are not actively typing, I'm usually resting my head on my other hand. So I just gave up
so I was assigned a spike this sprint
and my recommendation/research is to just not do this
I just started bioshock 2 two days ago!
feels weird
I played bioshock for the first time in the fall without it getting spoiled too
A spike?
when your team doesn't have enough info to estimate a ticket
you open up a spike to do research so that your team can estimate
typically for new technologies or implementations of something in ways you haven't seen or done before
I've heard great things about sekiro
Nice. 
I gave up on dark souls when I realized it was just a rhythm game. And a deeply unfair one at that. 
Sekiro has a better story than the rest of them, but as a back seat gamer it’s still mostly watching someone die fighting the same boss for hours (or days) at a time
Do you game yourself Phoebe?
Yeah, I wouldn’t watch someone else play it. 
Not trying to gate keep or anything like that. More of just curious what your relationship to games are in that you've expressed being a back seat gamer to Dark Souls.
I feel like watching someone learn will always be boring
Some, I don’t really play anything online cause I don’t have the hand eye coordination but I like bioshock, portal, civ, and a handful of others. 
I don’t think that’s true for very narrative heavy games. 
I actually really enjoy watching people play games that have a story element because I can still give advice and recommendations without having to be good at the combat myself
I would agree but a dark souls or super meat boy are more about learning and being challenged than master narrative
That was a really fun watch. Subscribed
I realized how dumb my question was after I had already read this thread where you've clearly said how you've played bioshock and are playing Bioshock 2 now.
I agree with that.
Yeah, hence Sam likes watching Uncharted a lot, and I think she'll enjoy the Last of Us.
If you haven't played Until Dawn, you should look into it. It's one of those games that you can play together where there's so many decisions and what not, that you can both play as one character together really easily.
Have you guys played Hollow Knight?
Yeah, I liked that one. Hard but felt fair. 
Highly suggest the game. Difficult metroidvania with dark-souls like storytelling, and difficulty with regards to boss fights.
Then good feeling movement for come fun platforming
I did play until dawn and really enjoyed it! That was one of the few where I was behind the controller. I would highly recommend watching the last of us, it was a great
Exactly which is why I usually knit through those :thinksmart: 
2 more months before I can drink alcohol 
<@UETS9HTSS> what do you think of hexblade bard sword or whispers multiclass?
whispers makes a good warlock multiclass if you like to do social stuff
sword bard is weird
I think it's not that powerful
but has interesting flavor
I prefer lore or glamour
it would give access to dueling fighting style and using my weapon as a focus (not that people really pay attention to that)
I was thinking more for psyic blades gain another 2d6 dmg for critting
so basically you'd have 1d8 weapon, 4d8 force (eldritch smite) and 2d6 psychic (psychic blades) X2
i would give up summoning a specter lvl 4 spell slots, an innovation and an ASi
i was wondering if rogue wouldn't be bad too
Hey, maybe I'll be able to bartend professionally again by then!
In case people hadn't seen: non essential businesses mandated to stay closed till May 4th
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/31/nation/coronavirus-boston-massachusetts-march-31/|https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/31/nation/coronavirus-boston-massachusetts-march-31/>
So Wayfair is going to at least have to extend their deadline by a week
My work thinks this could last until june/july
And by this I mean first wave/finding a new normalcy
That's sounds about right to me
People are silly thinking this would burn out quickly
Oh, this will last at least a year, our best hope is to decrease the cases as quickly as possible, and contain new cases even quicker
Hahahahaha can't contain what you can't test
Yeah, well people are working on that
Hopefully they get there soon. We need to test way more people for any hope of containment
I thought at least 1 company had FDA approved tets
I figure at this rate we'll all just get it before they finish the vaccine
Approved is one thing, manufacturing is another
Unfortunately things take time
Agreed, that's why I don't have faith that will get containment on this
That's why I said hope
Yeah, I'm not saying this will be over by May 4th. Just providing the updates as I have them
Good Morning Y'all!
New month, same me!
Normally today is Bad Internet Jokes day, but looks like we might be skipping that is year, which I'm actually happy about.
Still not gonna trust any announcements I see today
I guarantee there will still be bad internet jokes today
That's because bad internet jokes are all they have. Can't do too much for practical jokes today
Lol
I think the problem with bad internet jokes today is you can't tell the difference anymore
But they were also inevitable
Deep Fakes are the worst
Hmm, thought you were going to go for the Thanos one
The other crisis is emphasizing is how crappy the infrastructure our isps are, and how they have not been actually investing in their infrastructure like they claimed they would (we knew it was a lie, but now we can point to this and confirm it was a lie)
wait where did deep fakes come from?
I have no problem with our ISP infrastructure as it stands; it would be great if it were better, but it's definitely more than I need
liesssss
Now the fact that they took that money and didn't use it for what they said they would... that's despicable
In older communities, they have bandwidth issues due to shared lines, but I don't currently have that issue
i'm more of the opinion that if we had 10 gig internet you would have access to things that you couldn't live without
Similar to how everyone was happy prior to smart phones, but now everyone has one
I mean... look at Europe
they had to ask netflix to lower streaming quality so the internet over there wouldn't break
we didn't have to do that
Infrastructure changes the world in ways people don't understand
I'm not saying better infrastructure wouldn't be a change for the better
I'm saying that the current infrastructure is adequate for my current needs
yea, and that's their excuse
Which is bullshit
We don't need to invest, people are already _happy_
it's only bullshit because they took money to do the upgrade and then didn't do it
if they never took the money, then leave it to capitalism
I think what needs to happen is that a service needs to come into existence that uses a metric fuck ton of bandwidth
the current infrastructure will be overloaded, and the ISPs will be like: well fuck
guess we need that upgrade
Nah, they don't feel the pain, and who's going to create a service that doesn't work
It's like saying, "To get more railroad track, build a better train"
it'll work until adoption hits a certain point
not comparable
I'm just saying, I'm willing to bet netflix did more to make streaming work than the ISPs did
And that's a bandwidth devourer
they certainly had issues where the ISPs tried to make them pay more because of the bandwidth usage
"priority lanes"
Isn't net neutrality still dead and the ISPs can be doing things like "priority lanes" now?
yes and yes
their still assholes thats still bad
Thats why you still see the occational phone plan popping up with unlimited data from specific websites like hbo or whatever
Ah, ok then
Is anyone else losing their sanity yet? Sam is playing with a background sound generator and making herself a french cafe, with jazz music, street noises, and rain
I'm not sure how much sanity I had to begin with,  but I do feel like I'm losing whatever is left
Yes.
What is this sanity you speak of?
Yeah i'm not sure if I was ever sane.
Lol
That Corona gif is top notch
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/02/train-derails-usns-mercy-coronavirus/>
i hope he died
ive literally never wished that :confused: now i feel bad
no injuries
What an idiot
Wilco
I turned on some of the bots that can replace messages. <@UDC03KCGK> let me know if you see any problems pop up.
Wilson!
Walter!
BTW: the Humble Cornoa Bundle has some pretty nice games
Shit, actually I already have a bunch of these games. Gonna start a thread if anybody wants them.
Undertale

Hollow Knight

Wizard of Legend

Totally Accurate Battle Simulator

The Witness

Superhot

Tilt Brush

Killing floor 2

Worms Revolution

Europa Universalis IV
(All Steam Keys)
I've spent too much time on EU IV
My old roommate did as well
I'll take Hollow Knight
Is EU IV even worth it without the DLC?
Paradox games get like that sometimes
Was thinking about buying this bundle as well actually
what's EUIV like?
The game is similar to Civ 6 in some ways
Also, I'll take undertale
heard it's funny
I'll give a civ like game a try'
You managed to avoid spoilers?
of undertale
sort of
I know there's a cult like fandom about not killing shit
Wow, I'm still avoiding playing it hoping to one day forget everything about it
Don't think I will though
the game is worth playing even with spoilers
Oh well, the code got redeemed, guess I'll wait!
Good news, it came with a DRM free copy!
want it?
...what?
if no one else wants, I'd take EU IV
You have 3 copies of this game: your own, the one you just gave to Brenden, and a 3rd unused one?
DRM free means it is just an exe file
Eh, I'll check back with you on where I am with my list post quarantine
Killing floor 2 is a pretty decent zombie survivial FPS as well
singleplayer or multiplayer?
wait, I feel like I heard of that one
bad graphics, like original doom
creepy skulls floating towards you
only worth playing multiplayer. It's kinda like nazi zombies
towers in the darkness?
No it has decent graphics
ahh, different game then
<@UDC03KCGK> there is undertale
I'd really only play it if other people had it too
like, in this groupo
so I won't take it
if drew took it and actually wanted to play, I'd consider buying it
OH, I also have a copy of Slay the Spire
and
METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN (amazing game)
slay the spire is a great game
never played any of the metal gear games
I only played the Phantom Pain
I would take Slay the Spire. I never played MGS 4
the Metal Gear series does not go in any sort of order
chronologically, MGS4 is 10th (last) and MGS 5 is 4th and 5th
Interesting. To Brenden's point about Killing Floor, I'm fine to play more multiplayer games while we are all stuck to those waiting to be released outside again
Sam is living the good life. I just make food and CJ steals it while I am asleep.....
I’ve played MSG 1,2, and 3. All good. All worth playing. I do t know much about the later ones. 
Metal Gear 5 scratched the same sorta itch that the Hitman games do
though it is hitman in an open world
Would recommend Wizards of Legend to people who like rogulikes - a lot of fun co-op as well
I was thinking of getting that bundle too, but the only thing I saw there that I didn't have but kinda wanted was The Witness and was like :shrug:
Well, get the code from <@UDC4QL95G>
i slept through a 9-10 meeting today
:oof: I got pinged at 7 by the woc
oof. is your sleep schedule all messed up these days? Mine's kind of up in the air right now
its not that bad, i just decided to sleep in
Did you get in trouble?
Who is woc 
It's the wayfair code police basically. They noticed a query was breaking
I sleep till 11 almost everyday now
Nasty what did you break?
Ah it was just a logging table. Missed a comma when I added a column. Flipped a feature toggle and the kibana logs dissappeared.
DBA's just saw an increase in query failures on BOSQLINT64 and saw my commit message was associated with the query. No real impact
Man babies are cute little terror machines
Awwww,CJ likes being a dad :happ_panda:
It's so cute!
baebeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
That's her I got a poop cooking face
Her head in the 1st pic today look like it been photoshopped into a small body
Hey, what are people's opinion on Tabletop simulator?
I own it and have played it a few times. It's good enough for playing most games
How hard is it to use? On a scale of explaining to your mother
I wouldn't try to explain it to my mother
Hmmm My mom wouldn't get it, but she doesn't understand anything more complicated than Uno. My sister, whose gaming capacity caps out at aound Dominion level would understand fine
hey, I'm planning to run a little light-hearted space-themed RGP one-shot after work with a couple people from work. Well, a pair of just dropped out so would anyone here like to join?
what system?
Lasers and feelings. 
What are we using to communicate?
Google meet. 
Starting like 5:30
<https://youtu.be/M5FGuBatbTg>
Hilarious!...then made me sad :(
so I just got 115k cobblestone stuck in our ME system
wait... why did you put it in the ME system???
we only have 10 1k drives!
and... we need 19 million cobble...
I think it’s 25. 
I thought people said that 20 VP was the limit in Viticulture.
But there is a VP cap, that’s the interesting bit. 
So the rules explicitly say on the front page this is not the case
Hm
Also are people up to trying a board game over cameras? Or would they just prefer table top simulator?
WTF is going on here?
What? I'm reading the rules of Viticulture and then also asking on a tangent if people are interested in playing a board game in a Covid 19 safe way.
Also the rules say "counter-clockwise" and my gut wrenched at the words
Ohhhh I was asking because a) my dnd group have the attention span of kittens and b) my mom is not handling enforced isolation well
so random stuff I wanted to call out because it was annoying me this morning:
preface: don't support trump, dislike many of his decisions
reading news stories, they take a blunder by trump, or a statement and make it into a sensational clickbait article that demonizes him
as much as I don't like the actual thing he did, these articles stretch the truth and apply their own heavily tinted lens
the term 'fake news' has actually begun to resonate with me to some extent, even though I don't support him
I've had to ban multiple sources in my news aggregator for this reason
lol
I think that's my biggest problem right now is trying to cut through the noise on both sides is getting really difficult
Good afternoon monkies
Good Afternoon!
I mean it is almost 5 and I'm sitting down to happy hour with Sam, so I guess more of a good evening situation
Good afternoon! Or good evening?
I was apparently on Discord chat for the last 18 hours
Oops
Woot woot
I look forward to talking to you all more when you go "back to work"
im free
Be the change you want to see drew! What would you like to discuss?
yes
'free'
Free???? Trapped inside a tiny room
Free your mind CJ
I have a baby there is no freedom
Well, free the baby’s mind then. 
Sleeping eating and pooping, her mind is free
Funny about how Mel Gibson is shouted is about having his freedom when he has most definitely been put in jail before
Frankly CJ, you and Mei raising a baby right now is the best thing you could be doing. A time when parents normally isolate themselves from the world...you just don't have a world to feel FOMO about now
Yea there's nothing but disease and death waiting for us out there!
<@UDDE5960N> we need you to join the minecraft server and build me and <@UETS9HTSS> a base. We are currently living on a 250x250 slab of cobblestone with machines and magicial shit scattered around willy-nilly
it's a very resource rich slab of cobblestone though
ive been playing scrabble online like my life depended on it
Aysh, you also mentioned that there is an online version of Hanabi, right? We could try playing some of that.
hanabi.live
Seems pretty neat. Being able to take notes on tiles is nice
You want me to organize stuff????
That seems like a terrible idea
organize? nah, probably not
Fancy
build interesting stuff
more like we need a shell of a base to install the tech/magic stuff into
Also figuring put how to get pass that error seems like effort
what error?
Silence chaos seed
Oh it's way easier now. We are on the latest version of the pack
we also need giant pixel art
ehh, I disagree
also, I figured out something to do in abyssalcraft
need to find an abyssal stronghold
similar to how you find an overworld stronghold
just different pearls
We don't really need to find one, that only gets us access to the RED dimension
hmm
Apparently those Freaky Lesser Shoggoths create the things we need
Sweet
I need monolith stone
where do we find the shoggoths?
found them
will need your help killing though
as my shurikens can't actually hit them
might need to craft a ray gun
I put mine in the ME system
<@UDDE5960N> fix it
WTF IS THAT SHIT?!?!?!
That is like 30 hours of progress :lol:
Just a flat object in the middle of no where
The pack is a skyblock. You have to go to other dimensions if you want actual ground
That is what we started with
well, it's what I started with; dakota joined when I had a full chunk of cobblestone
I should see if the teleport pad takes me back to my original spawn. I had a small wood platform when I abandoned it
Uhhhhh ok....
i thought court of justice
oh like, basketball court
well, the courts of justice are also having troubles figuring out how much they can continue to process. Especially criminal courts, since delaying a trial has consitutional problems
icky, everyone has to do it remotely
Yo, who was talking about Civilization? There's a steam sale going on right now
I have Civ 6. Some people here were talking about Civ 5
Steam sale for just this game or a wider Steam sale?
Franchise sale
I have 6. Would happily play a game. Since it is Turn Based, this game would go on over the weeks right?
I have 5, which is the only one NOT on sale for some odd reason
I don't know if you can do Civ 6 Async
I'll look into it
civ 6 has a "play by cloud" option with an expansion
which means you get a steam notification whenever it's your turn
no idea how well it works
gathering storm introduced the feature
so do we need the DLC or not?
also I can't get a read for how good it is other than it's a steam notice
My internet is working better again by resetting my router and remaking the network names and passwords
sounds like someone was giving out free internet
So generous
<http://boardgamearena.com|boardgamearena.com>
hanabi is also on boardgamearena
anyone want to play hanabi now?
anyone watching the Wisconsin election saga?
No is it good?
<https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21209670/wisconsin-governor-delays-election-tony-evers-republicans-state-supreme-court>
no
But... why? Because they're trying to get voting Democrats sick?
because they think people wont turn out. low turnout makes it more likely for the incumbent GOP State Supreme Court Justice
But this is a primary? Or an actual election?
looks like its both
Damn this is going to kill their own people..... this level of cold blooded is... scary
This is the same state that upon losing the governorship, used a lame duck legislature to hammer through a bill that greatly reduced the governor's powers. 
Basically, I'm never moving to Wisconsin. Their fried cheese is overrated, and they seem to have a lot of bars without having any particularly notable breweries, vineyards, or distilleries. So I can be ok never stepping foot in that state ever again. 
Still horrible though, this is literally insanity on a troubling level
Can confirm, no breweries of note
Wisconsin's main draw is the Wisconsin Dells. They also have decent camping spots
soo thoughts?
banana

<@UDL020K8D> you own civ 6 what are your thoughts
I forgot I did. I just knew I had some civs. I don’t remember what belongs to 5 or 6. 

Civ 4 is best. 
idk; I really enjoyed V
but pitboss/asynchronous play is the important part
Good morning. 
good morning!
good. morning.
i agree with doug, however im not sure how mp would hold up for 4
So it got me thinking the other day, Massachusetts has ballot measures which are ways to circumvent traditional government bodies. Might be worth playing the long game now and start getting things like Vote By Mail and Preferential Voting through that way
Won't fix this today, or even next election, but getting the ball rolling in literally any other state other than Oregon would be progress
Good morn
today is the last day tiy cuddle with ashley for most of the day, very sad
Expanding vote by mail is a good idea, even for normal times. 
That is quite sad. Got to go back to WFH tomorrow?
Oh for sure. Just the whole pandemic got the conversation to front of mind again
yup!
I mean, you can probably do some work one handed while holding Ashley in the other.
Also is the plan to nickname her AJ, or just stick to Ashley?
Ash! Just to fuck with everyone!
I think that's the first I heard of the name actually
also typing one handed is hard
Call her Lee. 
no way thats mei's last name
Anyone watch Recess as a kid? Call her Spinelli
Good show. 
CJ, you don’t want her to be Lee Lee?
shes an O'Keefe first
Too bad you didn't spell her name Ashleigh, then she could be Leigh Lee
I dated a girl named Ying Ying. Her sister was named Ming Ming. I don’t see anything wrong with the repeated sound. 
just no
that's a no no
so what is it? whats the nick name going to be?
Who says she only gets one nickname?
so we're calling her Nick now?
Nah, we're calling her Dave
Lol I like the name lee 
<@UK7V13DS7> what are you calling her? AJ, Ashley, something else?
call her shley
or ashle :laughing:
I don't know why, but it mildly irks me that for all those meme's that are like "which of these quarantine people are you?" everyone is having a terrible time
no one is "just bored" or "meh" about it
Is there someone who is over it?
&gt; Can we call you Al, or maybe just Din? Or how about Laddie?
what do you mean by that?
I call her trouble marker
Maker*
So she's AJ "TM" OK
that's her rapper name
can't use that in public
Or DA (dumbass)
Are you irked that there is no "meh" option, or that somebody claims they not having a terrible time
the former
That's what i though. Agreed. I'm pretty solidly in the "meh" column
I was talking to a friend of mine with a 2 year old the other day, on speaker phone. The kid just learned what it means to hang up the phone and thinks its hilarious. So my friend prefaced the call with a warning that eventually the kid would hang up the phone. it was all pretty funny. of course he eventually did in the middle of one of his dad's sentences.
what do you mean by that?
I mean someone who is done and would like the plague to stop and the world go back so some new normal
No because it's too hard to determine if you've burnt it completely out given the how long it takes to show symptoms
China tried reopening and immediately closed again
My family just starting using this site. Mostly Carcassonne because my family is obsessed with it, but its been pretty useful.
:notsureif: cj is trolling or if he didn't get what you meant
Silence Chaos Seed
I guess I don't get what you mean
Lol
My understanding is that she was asking if in the meme I was talking about there was a character that fit the profile: "someone who is done and would like the plague to stop and the world go back so some new normal"
I want the plague to be done. I understand that won't happen for a while because humanity isn't good at isolation and we don't have a vaccine and we don't have widespread testing to see how is even affected. But I a) wish this wasn't happening in the first place b)  would like it to just go away
So yes, what Brenden said, I want someone in the meme to be over this shit
Is there anyone who's positive about it? Like "Hey, I have more free time and I'm using it to do what I want!"
I don't mind the free time, but all my roommates and I being stuck together has made me realize we are not compatible personalities and I need to get away from them either by this being over so I can be outside or back at work
and that is why I rent the master suite: so that I don't have to deal with my roommates if I don't want to; I can just stay in my room unless I'm cooking.
Ooph, that's rough.
sorry to hear the quarantine isn't working out for you though
It's okay, was never an issue before as we were all coming and going, our apartment was just where we slept. And I'm moving somewhere better hopefully in the fall. Short term problems
mocking-spongebob
I hadn't thought about that possible chain, but that's great that it just works
luckily the mocking only works on a message with no thread, otherwise it would chain forever
hmm, have a bot say it as a parent level comment
I wonder if that works
it might.
It works
is it posible to make the profile pic of the spongebob bot have a transparent background?
you would need to update the emoji
you would need to update the emoji
updating the emoji would fix the profile picture as well
the emoji has a transparent background

But another 200 city residents are now dying at home each day, compared to 20 to 25 such deaths before the pandemic, said Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner’s office. And an untold number of them are unconfirmed.  :cry:
Ah, then no. Apparently that is a slack limitation of using an emoji as a profile pic.
I added a new command. if you try `/events` you should see all the things prometheus has done recently. So if a message gets deleted recently or something weird happens, hopefully this should give some insight. (right now the logs include those in the test channel as well. I'll try to make that more clear as well)
Fancy!
<@UDC03KCGK> this should hopefully let you see what's doing on if your messages get deleted. I turned all the bots back on.

also, `/bot list` will now automatically show if a bot is disabled via code.
Sweet, thanks for doing that!
yeah, lot of bad news today. I think the CDC is predicting this will be "the bad week"
'the'
Think I just read the darkest joke pick up line that I've ever seenAX
Reddit can be brutal sometimes
Yes?
I would also like to know!
Curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought him back!
hey girl; are you a middleschool? cause I'd like to shoot some kids in you
:luffy_vomit:
you requested it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
:open_mouth:
ALSO worst pickup line
well that was the thread topic
"What's the worst pickup-line you've ever heard?" or something
Ok, no one actually heard that or used it though. They just made it up for this post
That's my guess; yes
I mean, it's the internet. People making up stories for fake internet points
There is no doubt in my mind that that pickup line was not only used, it very likely worked on more than one occation
both scenarios are possible ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Seriously, no doubt? I've never seen anyone use even a good pickup line to success
Brenden literally brought the line to this channel to share. That alone shows it is a discussion point
I have no friends who answer "How'd you two meet?" With a story of the guy or girl coming over to them at a social setting and launch into a pickup line that made the other person start talking to them
A discussion point sure, but not one that suddenly leads to romantic interest!
doesn't mean those people don't exist ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
A pickup line is nothing more than something to start a discussion....
My point is pickup lines are only ever good for starting discussion amongst friends about crappy pickup lines and joke around. I've literally seen not a single pickup line ever work to any success
The line itself has no impact on somebody's romantic interst, simply " Ok, you have my attention"
Thats because nobody talks about "what were the first words they said to you?"
my point is that you're using anecdotal evidence; I'm sure sufficiently drunk people have used pickup lines to success
Yeah, in that it got OUR attention to think about pickup lines or people on reddit. Do you have any friends who are like "Yeah, that person had a really great pickup line, so we started chatting then I went back to their place."
yes, I do
I have very low opinions on humanity as a whole
Your friend had success or was successfully picked up by a pickup line?
nope
Most of the time, the first sentence said in person is "Victoria?" Because online dating
if humanity has a few billion people of age to be doing such a thing, it'll happen
also dating apps don't help your cause here
I'll admit, I'm fully ignorant to how dating apps work for getting dates because I never ended up using one
All my girlfriends were people I met in improv or dancing
I have a friend whose strategy on the less serious dating apps like tinder is literally insult the person as bad as they can, or try to find the worst pickup line they can think of that's relevant
Wait, you do improv?
people apparently keep talking to him
Actually, the one from improv was also in the same dance group, so we can just shorten that to "I met from dancing"
Oh, it is a deja vu
yeah :smile:
or its that the lie?
:hyper-think:
and yes, I did Improv in college for ~3 years
Does your friend have any success on tinder with that strategy Brenden?
unfortunately, he has
to be fair, he's ripped
Hmm, certainly muddies the data with that then
also he's no longer single and he definitely met the girl on a dating app
no idea what strategy was used though
Cause as far I'm concerned, that could be people who were just like "I want a piece of that even though he's an awful person" (based entirely on his words used in that exchange, I don't know the guy outside of that)
You should find out what strategy it was to meet his current gf
Good morning 
Good morrow
you know what a great word is that just about never gets used even though we refer to the concept a lot?
overmorrow: the day after tomorrow
saves you three syllables
and rolls off the tongue much nicer
update: wayfair has decided not to grant me access to the office
they're going to order me a chair instead?
:oof:
Wait really???
problem is, I have no idea what it is about my chair that doesn't put pressure on my hernia
so my best bet is ordering the same chair
which is like $800
so I doubt that would get approved
Really? I think it would
Holy hell, I just realized this thread started last night!
yes sir
why is that surprising?
Good chairs are always expensive, and if you claimed medical reasons, there is a good chance they will approve
Shows how time is just a construct: I saw 11:15 and just assumed this morning and that you had just posted it. No one else had said anything today
Slack is screwing with me.
so time is immune to psychic damage?
Is this a real word that is in Webster's or Oxford dictionaries?
and may or may not get enraged by fire damage?
<https://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/Overmorrow>
does that count?
Hang on, "update"? When was the original story!
original may or may not have been over voice chat
original story:
Oh joy, all of my messages in this thread are gone!
had a unilateral (right) inguinal hernia diagnosed back in october
Oh ok. Still that's crazy. Great business chairs cost close to $1000, so I'm not surprised the one you want from the office is that much
was told I could live with it for quite awhile as there was no current danger
but might eventually need surgery, might not
Yea most business chairs cost upward of $500-2,000
ached for a while, then sort of didn't bother me
I was going to say, my understanding is surgery is the only way to make a hernia go away
once I was sitting on this chair all day most days, it started to bother me at all hours
You don't just pt or heal that back into place
makes it difficult to sleep sometimes
they cant just give you your chair?
so I put in a request to go fetch the chair I have in the office (that I bought and brought to work)
You wanted to go to the office and grab the chair back to your house? 
Yeah, hernias are no joke. That's definitely a thing about wfh full time from this quarantine I hadn't thought about
for medical reasons figuring that would be enough
....wait, you bought the chair you use at work?!
yes
Go to my chiropractor 
why would that help a hernia :suspicious:
It helps
with?
Um, Mei, he has a hernia, not a herniated disk in his back
hernia &lt;&gt; herniated disk
I have a literal hole in my organ cavity
and my guts are spilling out into my groin
thankfully it's a small hole
I feel like it would help
so only a little fat is poking out
Chiropractor would be as helpful as rubbing aloe vera on his neck for a bullet to the foot
the only thing that he could do it make something else hurt, or tear the hole wider
I need a surgically implanted mesh to cover the hole
Yea I guess my chinese doctor would only make the pain worse too
How much did your chair cost you
~$800
I spare no expense when I buy stuff that spends a large fraction of my life between myself and the floor
I understand
Things in that category include beds, air mattresses...not sure what else
yes, I wanted to do that
They have any idea what the hernia came from? Climbing? Genetics?
they don't; I do
I spent money on massages, chiropractor and Chinese doctor because it helps my pain 
holding in a goddamn sneeze
I know exactly when it happened
When do you need the surgery 
1 year from now? 5 years? 10 years? who knows
it's more like, when will I make the effort to get it done
unless I do something to make it worse, or something gets stuck out of the hernia and begins to die off, I can postpone this indefinitely
Wait, you couldn't just tell the doctors that is how it happened?
I mean, I did
but it's not like they told me
Probably can't even get him access to the building
Jeez, that's awful that something so innocuous could cause all that
it was a hell of a sneeze, I was in a scenario where I didn't want to draw attention to myself, and held it in more than I ever have in the past
lots of regret
That's crazy
I shall sneeze when I need to sneeze!
I've also been sneezed on a lot in the last 3 weeks I can only imagine this will continue
Omg I been holding my sneeze these few weeks... I’m scared now
I did it because sneezing hurts certain muscles right now
just don't try to fully stop it
I been doing that
careful with that
you can rupture your organ liner
<@UDDE5960N> I need to go check for hernia
nah, you'd know if you had one
well, you'd know that something was wrong
Well I was afraid of it bursting my stitches 
it aches a LOT
Nope I don’t because I’m on drugs
and you can push it back in
Everything aches
it'll be a lump
that shouldn't be there
Yea... I have that 
You can also crack/break a rib by holding in sneezes
But it may not be a hernia 
I cracked a rib by coughing 2 years ago
So scary...... but sneezing hurt right now
Mei you just gave birth, your whole body is lumps that are in places they shouldn't be
That sounds painful, breaking ribs
You're so nice to her
Oh it is, took about 6 months to fully recover
He tells the truth though
Breathing hurt, moving hurt, lifting things hurt
Wouldn't recommend
Unfortunately no, because on the actual merriam webster dictionary it isn't there
I also say giving birth is not recommended too then because all those things hurt me now
I'm more trying to have her stop panicking about a hernia and realize that it's likely just because she's recovering from birth
Yeah, I don't think she has to worry about that. But also shouldn't be holding in sneezes, just sneeze or cough into your elbow
she's doing it to avoid pain
Good enough
I agree with you it should be used and brought back. There's so much utility with a word like that
most languages have a word for it too
We in the US also don't use fortnight enough, since moving up north I've dropped it from my lexicon
I personally like fortnight as well
I feel like I'd get some weird glances if I used it though
My english boss used fortnight all the time we thought it was hilarious
I learned what a fortnight was when I was in England visiting my sister; it is a super useful word that should be used when it is appropriate
If you get an english accent no one will ask anything
But seriously, we keep having to tell people to quarantine for 14 days, instead of just saying a fortnight
Like, there's no reason NOT to use the term
Just start using it, maybe it'll catch on like tomoblem (a problem to be dealt with the next day)
So I'm taking this as lack of interest in getting a Civ Game going right?
If people are going to keep using new invented words and terms all the time like dabbing and flossing, I sure as hell feel vindicated using words that they have to look up if they don't already know like fortnight
they're invented for a new concept though, not for an existing one
it's a bit different
New and invented words is part of language though
I'd play
I'm not saying they shouldn't!
Simply that people will create a word, and then be surprised you didn't keep up with it. So why can't I bring back an existing word and explain "well, look it up" in the same way
We suddenly started throwing PPE around everywhere in this crisis without any of the reporting sources explaining the acronym. You had to figure it out or look it up
So yeah, see you all in a couple fortnights!
fortnight isnt commonly used?
nope
PPE was probably a health term, that existed and only just entered public lexicon
not unless you're talking about fantasy
I would not consider Fortnight fantasy
Yeah, that's exactly what PPE was. Doesn't mean anyone bothered to start explaining it as it got mass use overnight
I'm saying it's still commonly used in fantasy
Ohhhhh got it
cause it sounds ye olde english
exactly
Even though it is just, english
I'm not advocating to start running around using "trousers" or "nob", just use a perfectly good work that is for someone reason seeing a lack of use
I agree with you
Also willing to use overmorrow again, which was the original topic, but that one would require a bit more explaining
<@UDC03KCGK> it hurts to sneeze right now
Well, here's hoping Wayfair will buy you your exact chair again
I've always been sad people don't use widdershins
i love words i need to look up
Yeah, I got that from Brenden's message and your emoji :slightly_smiling_face:
discombobulated
<https://youtu.be/UnSILVWDKL8?t=1020>
I feel like the widdershins problem is that we have a word that explains the exact same thing. A perfect one to one synonym.
I just saw that video yesterday, did they use widdershins in it?!?!
no
Its just a recent thing with archaic words in it
Also I already use discombobulated regularly. Is that uncommon?
I'd say no
I thought the words from the site he was making fun of were made up
well, uncommon, yes, but out of use, no
:discomblobulated:
also, clearly some people in our group get confused by clockwise and anticlockwise, so maybe widdershins and antiwiddershins would clear things up
anti.... clockwise?
but why?
where is anti-clockwise used?
England.
WTF IS ANIT CLOCKWISE!?!?!
Yeah, I don't know how me explicitly saying "Would happily play a game" was misconstrued as a lack of interest in playing
It's called counter clockwise THANK YOU!
Its the british way of saying counterclockwise
I think he meant the lack of activity in the thread
Like the british way of pronouncing "aluminum"
Wow, I just realized that not only are there two different pronunciations, there are two correct spellings of it (though auto correct thinks I'm wrong for typing "aluminium")
I mean the problem is Doug and I have 6. You have 5. Brenden has played 5, but unsure if he currently owns it
I’m so bored and sleep deprived 
and from what we know, play by cloud is a feature in 6, but only if you buy the expansion? So async isn't a base feature?
yep
Just making sure but also I’m bored lol
I'm ok with getting 6, and the expansions
I already had everything but the required expansion :unamused:
it's on sale 50% off
bought the platinum bundle for like $10.25 + tax to get the expansion
for 6?
yeah
DAMN SON
well I had 8/9 items in the bundle
According to a reddit thread, it is patched into the base game the play by cloud
and it was cheaper to buy the bundle than buy the expansion a la carte
I can't imagine people trying to play Civ before asynch play was a thing.
it's not super uncommon for people to play online
or just leave the game open for a few days
"Hey, let's go play a casual game of Civ against each other. It'll only take 16 hours!"
downloading it now
simple solution: go to sleep
Moving Shadow of Mordor to my other drive, then downloading my copy of Civ 6
My laptop has an SSD with 238 gigs on it. Way better for playing games on, but it is small. However I have a 1tb HDD that came with the laptop as well as a secondary storage, so from time to time I'll move stuff over there that I don't use very often, so that I can keep my everyday files and games I'm currently playing on the boot drive
Have to take care of baby
I DON"T WANT TO HEAR THAT FROM YOU!!!!
Apparently when I go to sleep I don’t wake up to the baby crying 
seems to be only about 8GB
I got the platinum pack because the discount is silly
Bye Bernie. Never really understood your appeal, but liked parts of your message
Did he fold?
just did
today
We're fucked
O no
Creepy old Joe, vs. grab em by the pussy Trump
WHICH PEDOFILE WILL AMERICA LOVE MORE?!!?
Is trump the only one running on the republican side
nope
Wait, wasn't there no hope of bernie winning anyway?
there is a republican primary
not mathematically eliminated
but basically yeah, no hope
I thought they canceled the republican primary?
Are you really surprised? Bernie is too far on the edge to have been successful, he can't compete against trump, whereas Biden might
some states did, not all of them
No way, Biden will lose the same way that Hillary did
Ohhhh
I think Weld and Walsh have dropped out, but La Fuente hasn't
By storing emails on an insecure server?
Is there even enough delegates up for grabs to get the convention?
I'd have thought that for Bernie, but I know a lot of people who prefer him over all the other choices (Warren, Sanders, trump, etc)
currently the race is like 400-1-0-0
That's Sam's fear for when we have kids. I sleep like a tank
You wanted Biden?!
I don't even know these days. I just know of all the candidates in the democratic field, I would have been happy to have any of them over Biden...and yet we got Biden
well, there were a couple worse than Biden
Bloomberg, Williamson
Like, I don't think he gets people excited to vote. I think Bernie would have gotten more independents to vote for him. Unfortunately, those same people didn't show up to vote for him in the democratic primaries (the independents couldn't, and the kids who kept screaming Bernie's names from the hilltops who were democrats didn't either)
Am I happy with the candidates we have? No. Am I surprised? Also no
Bloomberg would have been terrible too. Didn't hear good things about Klobuchar or a couple of the others. But wanted Warren, would have been happy with Sanders, could've taken Yang or even Mayor Pete.
I think super tuesday is what went wrong, all the moderated united 2 days before
Yea but at least Sam gets more leave then you do!
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnRivUNrobA>
^ Bernie livestreaming now
Yep, that was what thwarted him ultimately
I wanted yang 
I'm just disappointed that so many people are going "Biden has a better chance to beat Trump!"
Which I think is exactly what a lot of people myself included said about Hillary.
We were wrong
We'll be wrong again
Apparently our baby is not a real person since city hall is not open currently. She has no birth certificate or San
Sure does.
maybe...... Trump has pissed off enough people
All though I think there's too many koolaid drinkers right now
The Youtube chat is terrifying
Well that, and I hardly think it is going to be a fair election. Wisconsin was a great test case for all the ways they can fuck with future elections and know the Supreme Court will let them do it
Not that I thought they would do things within the lines anyway
I feel bad for Sam if you don’t wake up to the baby
That was Wisconsin Supreme Court, not US Supreme Court
Which is not quite as stacked
<@UDC03KCGK> how many kids do you guys want?
Today is very depressing
It was both Supreme Courts
Wisconsim and US
Didn't want Biden in particular, but thought he was honestly better than Bernie. Wanted Pete or Warren
WAIT WHAT?!?!
I only saw the Wisconsin one
<https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/supreme-court-wisconsin/609631/>
I wanted Pete or Warren. But Biden has pretty good policy stances on his website and knows how to deal with people and politic, which Bernie doesn't. 

I very much doubt he's a pedofile - he just has different ideas of personal space. It'll be used against him though because most people (and probably correctly for American culture) see it as inappropriate
Fuck everything
Yea, I am a bit worried about voter suppression. It's kinda crazy - it used to be a pretty big deal, now it's a huge deal
Yeah, the Wisconsin Supreme Court was not what worried me. The actual Supreme Court of the US is the one that got me really down
Pete worried me after the whole Iowa Caucus thing had some really fishy ties back to him
Also, Bernie wasn't only too left wing. He was also unwilling to compromise or coalition build. He kept doubling down on "my way or the highway". He could have used his early momentum to get more people on board, say he wasn't just for the super left. But he didn't, as he hasn't in the past. I doubt he would have gathered more independent support - he couldn't even get Democratic support
Warren, Trump, Sanders, and Trump would each have been the oldest president ever on inauguration day 2021.
I looked a bit into the "fishy" things - it seems like Reddit just had a hard-on for hating pete and very little of it had any weight or truth behind it. I could be wrong, but it seemed like very manufactured hatred
and now we're guaranteed it
sorry, Warren. but she would be close
Haha, take that! Should have gone with that young lady
I never understood why Warren got so much flak, but I brought her up to a couple people who I knew were registered democrats and got some really visceral dislike responses about her
she came to WF a couple years ago. I was really impressed with her in person
Not a good sign the top article that popped up was OAN
<@UUL45BDKR>  really liked her and canvassed for her. I liked her well enough
Pete was just really fake. In high school and college he was a vocal Sanders supporter. Then got into consulting and picked up that consulting way of speaking where you never actually say things.
That talk at Wayfair was exactly why I voted for her. She was super impressive and was able to handle the uncertain situation with an air of grace. Since then, the situation changed, and she dropped the gloves with it.
Look, I'm not one of those redditors that is going to dig in his heels and not show up to vote because Bernie lost. I'll vote Biden and hate having to, but I'll show up.
I'm just not confident in people to drag themselves to the polls to do the same. I'm bracing myself for people to once again be disgusted in the choices, not waste their time, or say "I voted" and vote for a third party candidate who won't have a shot in hell to win under the current voting systems.
That's what people on Reddit said during his debates. I thought he had the best answers and they seemed pretty clear to me what he was saying...
Can't say, my mind was made up on Warren from quite a while ago, so it didn't make sense for me to put more time into the debates than if I just wanted to watch them for fun
I mean, being mass and RI is almost meaningless for pres, as we're deep blue states
This is why I would like Ranked Choice voting: Would have kept me engaged in the political process a helluva lot more, because I would need to know my backups and what not
The Platinum edition shows up for me as $38.61
It was like 48 dollars for everything for me
Which doesn't seem like the silly levels of discount you were describing
It basically gave me the crappy DLC as free
I know, at this point I'm voting to pump those rookie numbers up, whatever measures are on the ballot, and to just sit there and hope that even if Trump wins, the imbalance in Popular vote is so egregious that it lasts as a continued case argument for abandoning the electoral college for some future time period
This is all assuming that Trump wins a second term and the whole country as we know it just fails to exist and there isn't really a constitution to go back to
Maybe we need a new constitution? There are so many things wrong with it due to the time and people who wrote it, and things the founders couldn't forsee.
Amendments only go so far
Soooo Victoria for Rebel leader???
That's what I heard
Yeah, I mean, I don't think this last few years have convinced me our constitution is any good any more
No need for rebel leader, just making conversation
Most likely because she is a woman
That's all it takes for about 50% of americans
Too much of it was working just based on convention or people doing things because of precedent
I mean no law will ever be perfect, mostly because of what we're seeing now which is complete abdication of leadership
The admendemnts have to be approved by a certain number of states. That ends up with the same problem as the senate, as a minority of people in the country can totally block all changes.
No law will be perfect, but I'm pretty convinced a parliamentary system is better than what this is
I'm pretty convinced that burning traitors at the stake is what's needed
That requires defining traitors
I'm just gonna sit back and watch the world burn
This finally got to a logical endpoint: created two parties, that are nearly insurmountable, than creates a dichotomy of thought instead of a range
Might be difficult. There are people saying gear up for living in the equivilent of modern day Russia soon
is living in modern day russia bad?
From what I understand, yeah, it isn't great
I don't believe ANY media these days
Nothing but sensationalist nonsense
Oh boy...not gonna lie Daka, I quite simply don't have the time to take this conversation further
You could be right. Sucks that that is the reason, but it is the world we live in
I'm not sure there was much of a conversation to be had. There is far more disinformation floating around than facts, and it simply isn't worth my time to sift through and locate real sources
Basically, living in russia is only great if you support putin and are in the majority
Otherwise, life is hell and probably short
Any reason why i wouldn't make sure I do both of those things?
like if I gotta pretend I support trump in order for my life to not suck, i'm totally willing to do so
So you're willing to hate black people? and publicly shun them?
I'm willing to stand by while everybody around me does so. Bascially "Dont Stand out" is what I would live by
I'm not about to be the one dude in the crowd trying to be all "hey wait isn't this wrong?"
Cold Daka cold
Is it though? Why is simply letting thing lie bad?
Cause what's stopping it from being YOU
because if everyone thinks that then we're fucked
it works at an individual level if you trust others to do the activism
but at a population level, you're screwed
so basically, this kind of thinking is selfish
you're taking advantage of the others in society
Not saying I'm not guilty of this as well though
sorta disagree with `ou're taking advantage of the others in society`
but I am 100% in agreement on it being selfish
let me explain it a bit further
I am also 100% ok with being very much selfish when it comes to strangers.
because you're not actively being negatively impacted here due to something out of your control (race, religion you were raised with, poverty) you have the priviledge of being passive and letting the world burn around you
Yup agreed
in effect, you're taking advantage of the people who do have those hardships as they now need to do all the advocating
assuming you agree with what they're advocating for
Isn't that saying you are obligatied to fight for things you agree with?
obligated is a bit strong
Oh man, some more Wisconsin news: The results will not be posted until April 13th, due to a federal ruling.
Oh, and the Supreme Court of the US, ruling that Wisconsin could not delay the election and let people vote by mail with absentee ballots...voted from home...by mail
but to an extent, yeah
Even in a bad situation, I am the type of person to simply rough it out though. If i didn't have the privelege of watching the world burn, i'd simply burn
Wait, so you're saying if you weren't in the position you are now, where you can stand back and watch, you'd just sit there and burn? Just no fight in yeah even on a selfish, self-preservation level?
I wouldn't fight to correct society, just my own personal state
Ok, so to CJ's point, you would actively hate black people and shun them if that was what was expected of you to not stand out?
Very likely yes.
Because in some of these places, being passive isn't enough to "not stand out"
Well at least i would give the appearance of doing so
do you have a line you wouldn't cross
let's say we go back in time
would you keep slaves?
That's a hard one. I am pretty sure I wouldn't see keeping slaves as a bad thing if I were raised in a similar up-bringing back in time.
knowing what you know now.
not raised back then
If I got teleported back in time right now, and was expected to keep slaves, then yeah I probably would.
Hence, literally "we go back in time"
We go back in time can mean "lets imagine if we were born bakc in time" and "lets take modern values back in time"
Is it too late to hop onto this? Big civ fan, I currently have V but could get VI
not too late
Right, I'm not saying I don't get your confusion, just that Brenden was being literal there
I think more to the point
Is those things are happening here and now in different parts of the world
What would you do if that became the norm here
I think dakota's opinion is pretty clear by now
Probably continue living my life in a very similar mannar to the way I am living now?
No Daka, I'm saying a man of your stature is expected to have a servant/slave, do you get one to keep up appearances?
Never too late
I don't do anythign to keep up appearances now, why would I need to if slavery were legal?
don't dig too deep into it
we're talking hypotheticals
more like if you were required to do X to not stand out, do you have any lines that you won't cross?
So you're willing to be shunned for being a black person lover?
murder?
lynching?
keeping slaves?
rape?
cannibalism?
self-harm?
If all of that shit becomes legal, then some real crazy shit is going down, and i'm gonna do my best to stay the hell out of it
that's not the point
What's the point? I am missing something.
where's the line where you do stuff to fit in vs. abandon society and run away
clearly active racism is before you cross that line
Brenden is basically saying would you actively participate in a Purge like society?
not a bad analogy
1. All this is under the assumption that there is nowhere to go where things are different. If standing by and doing nothing is no longer an option, but moving is, then i will move
2. the line is flexible depending on the consequences for not following along. If for example, not owning a salve were grounds for arrest for being an anarchist, i'd sure as hell own a slave
No i would not actively participate in a purge like society. I would play home defense
speaking of the purge, did you see a government mistakenly played the purge siren for a curfew at night
But if for example, owning a slave was just the norm, no i would not participate.
I was so sad I missed this
Nobody goes around thinking "oh man, that dude i walked better not be racist". You don't have to actively go around proving you are not racist to stand out. The same will be true for like.. all of the examples you listed.
Yeah, this was all hypothetical
To see where your line was
Still not sure I know where it is, just what's before it
yeah, fair; but it's hard to draw a line without context
if it's kill or be killed, I'm killing
Yup
That's another one without context for me
context?
does that one need context?
either you die, or you kill someone
the only context that might matter is your relation to the person you'd have to kill
like if it's your son/daughter, maybe you die
but a stranger? I'm looking out for myself
yeah that's about where i'd draw the line as well
Someone attacks me, and it is kill or be killed? Kill
Someone has a gun to my head and tells me to kill a helpless stranger on the ground or be killed, I'm not killing the stranger. Probably will be killed in the process, but I'm going to make a vain effort to stop the person with the gun to my head
you've added a third choice: resist
Eh that depends on how sure I am that the dude holding a gun to my head will actually let me live.
If it is 100% Kill this stranger, or die, then bye bye stranger
I'm just saying those are contextual situations
yeah, of course this isn't black and white
I posed a hypothetical black and white question
But if it is 100% shoot my son or die, then bye bye me
Yeah, I'm just saying some of the hypotheticals posed to Dakota before had some clear lines or examples in the world in which to figure out his line.
For mine, I guess you'd have to have me in a room with auto turrets and bullet proof glass around me and told that 2 enter, only 1 may leave.
lol someone :ath::ere:'d #emergencyroom
oof
Like, a situation where there truly is no way to resist, or resisting is 100% completely fruitless
yeah, that's the situation I'm posing
:rip:
Ther is also a 30 minute timer, that if the other dude's heart hasn't stopped, you are getting filled with holes
and you are both chained to a chair, that will auto release when the other guy's heart stops, but he is in a coma
Do you have to add those conditions?
Also that is either Saw 1, or a flashback in Saw 3 to Saw 1 events
never actually seen any of the movies ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I arbitrarily chose 3
Like are the extra conditions for you to do it Dakota, or just upping the scenario for me?
YEah otherwise you could say somethign like "Nah i just sit around until somebody comes in and I shoot them"
he's just upping the scenario
I don't think that's necessary really. The auto turrets did that
No one is coming into the room, they'll just shoot me with the turrets
yeah, but what if you just duck under the barrel
how about the classic train problem
I said turrets not turret
would you pull the lever to kill 1 person instead of 5
Nah
how about 1 person instead of 20?
50?
100?
1000?
Trolley problem you laid how, yes, I kill the 1 person to save 5
I'd never hit the lever, unless somebody i knew was in the larger number
interesting
so you'd wipe out humanity over being passive
well, I guess that's impossible because you know some women
but near extinction
Nah, there is a point where too many people would die, and then my life wouldn't be able to go on as normal
LIke, how are the people selected.
random people you don't know
See there's a line somewhere, I'm just having a hard time figuring out where or what it is
if it is 1 dude, or like... all of Norway then RIP Norway
I'd like to say I'd pull the lever, but I might freeze up
I just don't know how I'd handle the situation
I think I'd definitely act at 1:20
The Trolley Problem is where I turn into a very cold calculated person
it seems like a sizable enough group that I'd be able to make the snap judgement
probably 1:10 as well
but as we hit 5, I get uncertain how I'd react to the snap decision
Trolley problem doesn't get complicated for me until you start putting in boundaries, like people you know, or you yourself are impacted
how about you get that button that deposits 1 million dollars in your bank account if someone random that has been within 100 feet of you in your lifetime dies
Were you back at Northeastern when it happened?
Hmmm actually if you take away my ability to see them, and it were simply like numbers on a computer screen, i'd choose the lower number every time, even if it defaulted to the larger
do you press the button
how many time?
I'm assuming it pops up where you are RIGHT NOW and cannot be moved?
cuz getting out of range of people wouldn't be that difficult
nah, let's say you can keep the button and use it later
but the pool of people remains constant to when you found the button
Are you included in the 100 feet
no
Well for damn sure I know nobody with 100 feet of me right now, so it is pretty tempting
But literally anyone you've ever interacted with is in the pool
You can't outrun it
though i don't think 1m wouldn't be worth it.
I might it it for 10
dakota, within 100 feet of you IN YOUR LIFETIME
not right now
oh missed that
then nah
not for any amount of money
that's surprising to me actually
for some reason I expected you to push it
I think it is consistent. What I've gotten from this is in just about every situation, Daka picks the passive option
Like, if it were he would get the 1 million dollars, unless he pushed the button and saved a random person who had been within 100 feet of him. He would not press the button
The lines I draw are VERY different for strangers.
So far every answer can be predicted by "Does Dakota have to actively DO anything?"
Nah that is totally not right anymore. Id pick the lower number on a computer.
And almost every one of my answers changes if anybody I know is involved
National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact|https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact>) could get it done with a majority of electoral votes. Definitely some questions on legality and whether states will go through with voting for a popular vote winner who didn't carry their state, though.
Sorry call
1. I think the black and white and resists misses the very important fact that you can influence how you end up in that position. Example: Invading army tells you to count the number of times your daughter is raped or she dies. You had the ability to influence this before you got there and you did not.
2. Did you guys ever participate in the automated car ethics quizzes? It was really neat to see what influenced your decision and how it lined up with society
I don't like that quix
why?
It places false value on factors that I didn't even consider when making my choices
it also asks different questions every time
I also didn't even realize that certain aspects were in question, like the walk symbol
yeah :confused: just tried it and agree with Daka
why would someone being an athelete matter to me?
I think it is athletic vs possibly overweight
I went it in with the opinion:
The car should not make decisions on who to kill (always go straight)
The car should always prioritize it's passengers.
Sometimes the car was empty though
The idea of someone being an athlete vs. being overweight is someone who takes care of themselves physical vs. someone who does not
basically: Passengers should treat the car as a moving train. Get out of it's way
i thought the car shouldnt prioritize itself because those in the car signed up for being driven around by a robot?
The entire system of a self driving cars does not work unless EVERY car is 100% predictable
I mean those are all choices you're allowed to make, it's just an interesting game
There was a CGP Grey video on it so I saw it
Why not? How is it different than you driving?
Put anything into a CGP Grey video, and I'll see it quicker than just about any headline or piece of news
Humans are inherintly predictable
I would argue machines are more predictable as their more literal
I don't think that cars should take in metadata about how valuable people are
Machines can be fed fewer variables and can be more predictable.
If a car can choose to kill it's own passengers, the car itself is less predictable.
at most, it should avoid as many as possible, giving extra priority to itself
IMO: riding the car should be safer than crossing a road full of them. IN a world of self driving cars, i would hope they are moving WAY faster and performing manuvers impossible for human drivers
Same. I thought tumbleweeds were boring but I watched his video and discovered that they're fascinating

It was either when I was in school or when I was a co-op and I just didn’t get the message
Quiet day
Always quiet
Thank you everyone for your baby gifts 
Here is a gift for you in return 
aww she's so cute :slightly_smiling_face:
such a peaceful baby :heart:
Only in pictures
Generally because we're busy when she's not peaceful
Wait, was that a dejavu?
Ah it was! thanks `/events`
lol
must be the way the botify bot combines with the dejavu bot. so emote added, but message replaced
she's only peaceful in pics, a terror at night but she does sleep through all noises. Funniest thing is her hitting herself during sleep
I do that too!
Haha
Well if you used the baby straight jacket, she wouldn't be able to do that
/roll 1d20 +1
she escapes
Is that a real thing?
yes it is doug
mei is typing, baby straight jacket is not the same thing as a swaddle. we swaddle her
She escaped her baby lock jack when she was in the hospital multiple times
When she gets older get her a lock picking set
 She'll either become the world's greatest thief or escape artist
Hmmmmm I like this plan!
Looks like censor bot and chaos seed not playing nicely together. 
i broke my phone screen :disappointed:
Oh no. How badly?
usable but needs repair
are screen repair shops essential though?
:oof:
theyre optn actually! im just annoyed because the phone was ~250 and this is the 2nd time ive broke nit (My fault completely)
Do you have a case? I drop my phone all the time and my otterbox case keeps it in good shape. 
i need an otterbox
Oof, is the banned word I? I’ll add it to the ban ban list. 
`I`
is without the s
On list now. But Ban ban list only stops it from being an Ed in the future. You’ll have to work with it today. 
thats fine
At some point i need to get the `/ban` commands up and running again
I is on my ban ban ban list
I find it chaotic that you can't tell if the person meant I/you/he/she/it
The entry on top? I added it after this comment. 
by that, I meant I don't want it banned from being banned
Oh, I see. 
Miscounted joe many times you said ban. 
update: they ordered me a copy of my chair in the office and it's being shipped to my apartment
well, almost a copy; I made a couple of adjustments to the options
nice
well that's an interesting combo
seems kinda broken
fancy
why?
I like it
The nice spam is exactly how the bot is supposed to work. The reactions are a bonus
Nice 
I would like one too please
I am bored and want to   make steamed dumplings , does anyone have reciepes they like (Veg preferred but i could also just substiture the meats)
I think it has to be lower case
nice
<@UDDE5960N> go order one 
I think I want to change the nice bot to post once per impersonation, so its like everyone said it. Maybe minus the person who started it. instead of just choosing a fixed number of times to nice
mocking-sopongebob
mocking-spongebob
no chair for you
<@UHQD9J1SL> search for the korean manudu recipe since they use a lot of veggies. 
<https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/mandu> ?
Can i sub the 'skins' for smthing homemade?
Ohhh right i forgot it's a set amount
the mock bot checks if the event is from a bot and stops
currently, it could be changed.
You can make your own dumpling wrappers
ok!!!
<https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/mandu-pi|https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/mandu-pi>
no tools required! nice~
<https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/world/oldest-yarn-neanderthals-scn/index.html>
aww you disabled the interaction?
I think we need it to be able to mock bots, since cj is a bot 1/4 of the time
I don't remember doing it. Possible I added that line for some other reason
I'll pull out that check
Silence Chaos Seed
Silence Chaos Seed
we always remember too late
that's the beauty of the bot
basically the point of why it posts after a random number of messages &gt; 3
that's the beauty of the bot
It's a set amount? I thought it was randomly between 3-10?
it was 3-10. how its the number of impersonations, minus you
Cool, so everyone jumps in every time?
It is possible because Mei isn't opted in?
Um, also mocking spongebob didn't work on this post from what I can see
I'm actively monkeying with it right now
Neat, the scrambler worked!
...well, both of them working
ok, that's why I had it check for if its from a bot
thread unfollowed
I remember now
wait, mocking spongebob is only supposed to work on a message in teh main channel with no thread
It was never intended to work in threads
Ok, but it never even mocked your initial message
that is because the thread wasn't empty
current functionality should be not to post if there is any thread already, as Dakota says.
Fire or Box came first, created a meassage on teh thread. When sopongebob came along, the paren't message had a thread and so no spongebob
do you wish people 'happy good friday'?
no
Its a somber type holiday
Is today good friday?
yes
holy shit easter is on sunday
yup
its passover right now too
not sure what passover is
Its when the final plague came to Egypt
and God caused the angel of death to pass over the Jews
and Moses led them out of slavery
i feel like we discussed this before and Dave offered some isight into it
That's a nice succinct explanation of it. For something so important to Christianity history, Passover doesn't get talked a lot about in detail if you aren't Jewish or look into it yourself
He probably did and I forgot
Dave is actually Jewish so will know more. I've ended up with a fair number of Jewish friends, so am speaking from learning from them and just general study
They always showed The Ten Commandments on TV on Easter. Great movie, Charlton Heston as Moses.
For context, in Catholic services, normally there is music to enter, and music to leave (along with the rest of the music throughout the "Mass"). 
For Good Friday? The priest and alter server (at least for my small church growing up) would come in with no music, lie on the floor, and then go on to do the Mass afterwards. 
Then when everything was done, the priest and server, just walk straight out and it is expected everyone leaves church without talking to anyone else.
i remember snippets from that movie. im sure the FX were all the rage back in the day
I want to watch Ben Hur ( the 1959 one), but would also watch the Ten Commandments someday.
I watched 28 Days Later last night for the first time (28 days since getting back from Paris and being quarantined).
Are you gonna wach 28 weeks later 28 weeks since getting ack from paris?
yeah, probably.
No. Watched it before, and even with the context of this movie, don't remember it being particularly good.
Though the scene with the helicopter was pretty damn exciting when I watched it.
Where I was going with this is that Haye's code era movies are something that take some particular moments of random motivation for me to watch, even if they are widely regarded as great. It's why I have such a blank spot in my movie watching for most classic movies.
It was fun zombie movie, nothing special
Haye's Code?
Also if this thing goes on 5 more months, that's a whole different level of circumstances
Sorry, Hays code without the e and apostrophe. 
It was a code of rules and ethics by the MPAA for film between like 1930-to late 60's. 
Basically it's why classic films from that time period have very little blood or gore, or bad guys ALWAYS had their comeuppance. It's also why when you get to 70's, and especially 80's, you have an explosion of much more dark or edgy films, and especially more morally complex ones.
In some ways, films from that era can be better or more masterfully done (my film class teacher had us watch both renditions of Cape Fear and I honestly think the Hays code film is better despite the newer one being a motherfucking Scorcese film) but they do have that veneer that you can practically taste from any film or TV show depicting the 50's.
i  suppose because its like...a funeral for Christ-ish?
Depends on if you classify a crucifixion as a funeral and execution all in one
you oculd wtahc it even if the pandemic is declared over
But again, I already saw it and it isn't one of those movies that grabbed me the first time enough that I want to rewatch it
just found out my team and a partner team are merging
going from 2 devs, to 4-5 devs
the questionable 5th will be a L3 IC
nice!
the tradeoff is I'm getting a new manager that I don't really know much about
he was onboarded the week of the layoffs
so he's fairly new
and I haven't had much interaction with him
he was onboarded the week of the layoffs
ohpmmm
that's a sucky week to come on
yeah, I felt bad
Changing teams during the quarentine sucks. Really hard to onboard with everything when there is no face-to-face
they're a closely related team, so it should be too hard
like so close that we share an ops rotation at this point due to people leaving the company
Good morning!
Good morning
Good morning!
Mornin'
Okay
Okay morning!
Yeah, not actually the greatest. But I figured that would be a bad thing to start the whole channel’s day off on. 
Ummmm???
Am I missing something?
Probably. Do you know where your wallet is? Take a look. You’re missing a $20
Something extra wrong today? Or just the same stuff that's been going wrong for a month?
is this guy on drugs?
or just really bad with a mouse
I know Naveen. Well, maybe there are multiple Naveen’s at WF. I know a Naveen at WF and he’s a pretty good guy. 

I totally get messages for cmacdonald every once in a while. 
yeah, that's fine
it was more the "thanks for saving me." sent to the whole channel
now he's reacted to me with :grin:
Ah, maybe he’s doing it from mobile. On mobile I accidentally send messages to channel half the time. UI so bad. 
Nothing wrong, just said okay
Good times! What game is it?
Big book of madness
Pretty fun game - a light-hearted coop deck builder with decent depth
Also, happ Easter to all!
:rabbit: 
Happy bunny day!
Rabbits are tasty 
I’ve never had rabbit. 
Rabbit is one of the only things where I think the moniker "tastes like chicken" really applies well
I like rabbit, but think it's a pain in the ass unless the chef takes it off the bone for you
Happy easter all
Good Morning!
Morning
It is morning; hello.
Did you one more turn yourself to 4 am again?
nah, won at 8:30pm when I posted to discord last night
didn't start a new one
The sun has risen
Greetings, fellow earthlings
I'll take your word for it. Its cloudy enough that if the sun took a day off and got his cousin to sub in for him today I wouldn't notice.

I find it amusing because it sounds like corona

Solar flares are one thing, this is slightly more dangerous to life on earth
Everything triggers something, which is why this whole safe space shit annoys me
yeah, honestly
Wait, where are people getting triggered?

for questioning why a coronavirus emoji should be inherently removed
OMG  WHO got triggered by this, whats wrong with people!
this is historical triggering

Just got a phone call from the power company. Said thunderstorm coming in today, possibility of power outages. Noted that it may take longer than usual to get power back due to Covid.
... I am not at all prepared for power loss. Should probably go pick up some candles
................oh.
Just make sure your phone is charged. 
I got a couple external chargers around. this wind is kinda nuts though
Icky
so that's nice
my lines are underground
heh, I found the updated amazon sitemap today
what does that do?
gives us all the amazon PDP URLs

Best part of working from home:
having my chair run into repeatedly by my roomba every day at 100, and watching it clean the same 6 square feet of floor 17 times as it tries to figure out how to leave the room
Little dude just runs full bore into wall after wall after wall. I feel like i should have gotten the slightly smarter one that maps the apartment
I'll take that review into consideration at the point I convince Sam to get us a roomba
Your pain is our benefit. Thank you
Aw little silly Roomba
Nah it's totally amusing as long as it hasn't sucked up a power cord or something
and the little celebration beep when it finally makes it's way back to the dock is always funny to hear.
It seems my grandad said hi to the Roomba today , first time he saw it :sweat_smile::sweat_smile::sweat_smile::sweat_smile:
gotta make friends with the robots now.
my respect for cuomo is growing as I watch him speak
<https://www.pscp.tv/w/1YqxoQLDbMlGv>
who is this guy? NY?
yeah
just lost signal from that conference
same
back up?
I'm watching something now. can't tell if its live or circled back to the start of the braodcast
same
Its weird that they are calling these the Northeast states, when they are all South of New England
ny is still considered a part of the northeast
they didn't call it new england
I certainly wouldn't call NY a southern state
true, Pennsylvania is pretty firmed Midatlantic, though
northeast actually includes both new england and mid-atlantic
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States>
its..... the north eastern part of the country ?
yep
unless you don't have New England. Then its the region that is second most north and east
why are you posing untrue hypotheticals?
do you not like being lumped in with NY?
I'm not. The specific partnership I'm watching Cuomo talk about does not include New England. I'm remarking on ABC calling it the NorthEastern states
pretty sure it includes MA, but the governor of MA just isn't on the call
let me verify
<https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/coronavirus-death-toll-in-new-york-state-tops-10000-cuomo-says.html>

Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and New York
where are you reading that?
&gt; Cuomo said he will make an announcement later Monday about plans for reopening the state in conjunction with some other governors.
&gt; He said he and governors from Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island have been talking “for the past couple of days, about coming up with, how do we come up with a reopening plan? And can we work together on a reopening plan?”
and Cuomo said 6 states
interesting
is this different?
<https://www.coneg.org/>
yes
either way, they're still northeastern governors
this is what happens when then feds fall down. a confusing patchwork of regionalism
On the other hand, mine is great
Good Morning!
<@UETS9HTSS> Mass joined Cuomo’s multistate compact last night. Not really sure why it happened after the press conference wand everything, but oh well. 
Wisconsin results came in. Dem beat the incumbent Republican for state Supreme Court. This race was generally seen as why the GOP insisted on not postponing the election. 
I wonder if the rest of new england will?
Also good, fuck GOP
Good, but I really hope we don't see a massive uptick in Covid 19 cases out of Wisconsin as a result. 
Top headline on Washington Post last night was about South Dakota and it becoming a hotspot
There's enough people in south dakota to become a hotspot?!?!?!
South Daka*
Yeah, they still hadn't shut down a major meat processing plant until this week when it became responsible for half of all cases in the state
Fun fact, they're also one of the biggest producers of pork, so that might become scarce soon
even though I don't have a working camera on my laptop, it still feels weird to hop on a work call when I'm not fully dressed out of the shower in the morning
was running late this morning
LOL!
Anyway to make the 3rd person bot and the contraction bot play nicer with each other? I'm just not sure how you easily code the 3rd person bot to change to Brenden "doesn't" or "Brenden is"
<@UDC4QL95G> <@UDL020K8D>
Yup. Smithfield breakfast sausage :(
Just gotta be not lazy and code those things in
Right now the system sees all the replacement requests made and picks one at random. I believe only the third person not actually happened here. The contraction is most like a typo in the original. 
Not sure I follow. "I don't" and "I'm" or "I am" all make sense in Brenden's original post.
I"m saying the contraction bot didn't come into play here. Those are contractions Brenden made himself.
I don't know a good way to fix the third-person bot without maintaining a long list of all possible first person constructions. Maybe there is a python library out there where someone else already did this.
I mean you'd basically have to teach python first vs. third person, which to doug's point, probably already exists we just need to find it
But it's all grammar at this point, not programming
Like you'd basically make a dictionary of First to third person verbs
Doable but tedious
Real comment
real comment but edited by a bot
You can always check /events to see what bots fired, if you need confirmation. I do need to work on making it more readable though. 
Yeah that is a feature i'd classify as "not worth it"
Though I typically lose interest after the POC an any given bot
why is this slack quiet :disappointed:
No internet for me
oh
CJ has been put in time out by nature
Yea its terrible!!!!
Slack is no longer my best time killer while working
I have plenty of other distractions to amuse myself while "on the clock"
Lol!!!!
All of brenden's talk about a chair made me go and buy a new one. finally arrived today
what did you get?
pics or it didn't happen
mine arrives in 4 days
my old one was a piece of crap. This one was a budget chair that I kept seeing people recommend on reddit
looks cool in a temperature way
what did reddit tout as it's strength?
Best chair for the price
what's the price point?
&lt;$300
that's the best chair under $300?
it doesn't look like much, but I generally trust reddit on shit like that
Well it was in a ton of threads, where people were were recommending much more expensive chairs. IT came up almost every time.
mostly "just do yourself a favor and buy an expensive one, but if you hate your self, at least buy XXX"
where XXX is the chair i bought
I swear I've seen that office chair before in random conference rooms at Wayfair
Or at the very least Brigham
Chair is only sold at IKEA. I doubt wayfair would have them in office :lol:
old chair.
looks past its prime
Far past it's prime. IT was also &lt;$100 on wayfair clearance
currently sitting on a &lt; $100 staples piece of junk I've had for nearly a decade
hence my request for a better chair
which one did you get?
Tons of people recommendign `Herman Miller` chairs. and those have around the price range you described
I like the various ways I can sit on mine
I originally found it at a collab at my old company
though it was a bar height chair
plus I like sitting on my foot, so the plus shaped seat lets my toes dangle while I'm doing that
The chair I want doesn't exist and it makes me sad. The closest is the "gamer chairs", but they're horribly uncomfortable, super expensive, and just silly
The chair I want doesn't exist and it makes me sad. The closest is the "gamer chairs", but they're horribly uncomfortable, super expensive, and just silly
I couldn't tell if reddit just likes hating on teh DX racer chairs, or if they are actually bad. Mixed messages on those
What do you want in a chair Dave?
lots of threads where people saying shit like "yeah they throw gamer on it to upcharge" and other saying that it was good
I sat in what I *think* are real ones, and they were awful. 

What I want in a chair I THOUGHT was fairly basic, but I guess not. I want:
Fabric (dislike mesh)
Well padded so it's comfy
High back with a headrest so I can lean back
Ability to learn back and kinda rest in it
Movable and padded arms

So, like a gamer chair, but not awful. I dislike leather bc it looks nicer but is less comfortable. And mesh is just all around negative to me. I don't get hot in chairs, so I don't care bout that
Fabric seems rare in a higher end chair
mine is fabric
just weird shaped as well
&gt;&gt;&gt; The Treasury Department has ordered President Trump’s name be printed on stimulus checks the Internal Revenue Service is rushing to send to tens of millions of Americans, a process that is expected to slow their delivery by several days, senior agency officials said.

:facepalm:
I just have to ask, with the stimulus checks from when Bush/Obama (were there 2? Or just one check?) Did they have either name on them?
My gut is like "Um, that's not your money Donald, Congress did that. You just didn't fuck it up by putting your signature on the bill"
No, previous measures like this did not have the presidents name. 
Yea, it's so weird to me that high end chairs don't do fabric
I mean, is it really that weird? Most people don't associate fabric with quality. Leather and even that mesh does. Totally get that they aren't to your preferences, but when you can only make so many products at profit, the demand makes the choices.

brenden what is yor $800 chair?
Good morning

not where I bought it from, but I think that's the major seller
huh. That chair is oddly appealing
Clearly I thought so too
ooooh - im not considering it because $ but is the seat what makes the difference? or the back too?
combination
do you ever sit in it backwards?
yep, I definitely do
kind of nice having support on the front once in awhile
almost like you're laying down but sitting
the lack of arm rests would take getting used to, but I can definitely see the appeal of the chair
when I'm typing, I don't actually use armrests anyway
the saddle seat makes me sit more upright
though I can still sit on it like a normal chair
I just do that less
Morning
Good morning. Computer told me happy tax day, but my understanding was the date was pushed off for federal and state
also my understanding
Also our checks got direct deposited today
So I don't need to see Trump's ugly name put on it to go cash it
<https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/14/834588506/trump-says-he-will-halt-who-funding-pending-review>
seem weird to anybody else to cut funding before the epidemic is contained?
Even if they were 100% at fault, I feel like the investigations should happen _after_ people have stopped dying.
Its because they correct him when he misspeaks and don't bow to his will
it would still be weird to cut funding afterward
Apparently a lot of people are pissy at WHO because they seem to be catering to China
But yes, trumps being an asshat
A lot of companies cater to China, it's a larger issue that might need to be addressed, but just as many cater to the US, and we'd never want that to stop
Can twitter just ban trump? I would love to see that kinda shitshow
that would be phenomenal :mj_popcorn:
I think they can, but they won't
Twitter has said its taking a lighter hand with world leader,s if if their tweets violated the company's terms and conditions
Twitter has done a lot of double standard things. It's actually a significant part of why I just don't use Twitter anymore
Twitter is a company, whatever gets the clicks/views/revenue man!
I know it's not going to happen, I just would love to see how he handles it. What happens if he cant reach all his followers
well, they've protected themselves pretty well there. Its long documented that the conversative charge that tech is biased against them makes tech far more tolerant of bad behavior on the right.

Very weird article
We are all just figments of Dave's imagination
If literally everybody you meet tells you that they are not real, at what point do you start to believe them.
I choose to believe that the world is not part of my imagination
if it were, I would be a terrible person
See but that is in the absense of other people telling you that they are part of your imagination. If the for the rest of your life, the very first thing to come out the mouths of those you meet was to tell you that they are not real, at some point i think you could be convinced
I would choose to not believe and live in denial
Also I would be annoyed
I don't need to hear "I'm not real" at the start of every damn sentence
LOL!
Nah, they only tell you once
and it is only first time you have any dialog with the person
that would be kind of useful actually
Acknologments and things like "thanks" don't count
knowing that you hadn't talked with that person before
I would find that terrifying
"SHIT SHIT SHIT WHERE DO I KNOW YOU FROM!?!?!?!"
There's something comical about sending the IRS tax forms by paper, that I'm scanning digitally for record keeping, but also sent them the payment electronically
also that you have to send things to the IRS at all. your employer sends in the same information
The reason you have to send the same forms as your employer is to check against fraud
not all places do it like that. In the UK and Japan they calculate for you.
Also, the whole reason I'm doing this is my wife worked as a Freelancer, so I have to file a schedule C and Schedule SE. Most tax software stops being free when you throw those things in.
Yes, but this is the US, the land of red tape
I've heard India can be really difficult in terms of red tape for applying for a visa.
to India?
To India. Full disclosure, I'm just going off of podcasts of people who were going there and probably had to declare for filming. I can't say if it was just them going to visit.
You would know more
Due to the sheer volume on Indians coming to the US even on these 'specialized work that the US does not have capacity to fill with citizens' type work VISAs, its incredibly difficult from Indians to get a VISA to the US.
To visit India, you can get the visa online.

if you wanted to move- Yeah, I dont know.

India has LOT of redtape in general but its worse because of the prevalence of bribery :stuck_out_tongue:
<https://www.passportindex.org/comparebyPassport.php?p1=in&amp;fl=&amp;s=yes> i kinda love this website

I mean, I get it in that fabric isn't a "premier" material, but it's so much more comfortable so you'd think there was SOME brand with it at the high end
Again; mine is fabric
Wait it thought your chair was in the $800 range
sorry; what is the price range of high end?
mine ranges from $800 to $1200
~1500 i'd say
.
good to know
Interesting, India requires a visa for short-term tourism. although it looks like the eVisa is easy to get.
Uh, how are you basing these ranges?
Uh, how are you basing these ranges?
High end chairs are ~1500

Half that price is mid range,

Haf that price is low range.
Like the chair you just bought Daka would be mid range to me. The Ikea crap I'm on would be low end/budget, Brenden's chair would be high end, and anything above that is just luxury
Chair I just bought is low range at best. bearly above trash tier
nah, fuck all that
this is high end:
<https://www.architonic.com/en/product/ares-line-xten/1094040>
your $1500 chair is the trash tier
I can't even see a price on that page
it may or may not be 1.5 million
Alright you win.
this is the mid range:

lol
evil i like it
I’m not a fan of her
same
but more
Ohhhhh?????
Stories?
wait, maybe I'm thinking of someone else?
I was just telling nick the other day about how much her questions bother me
wait, I think I'm confusing her with someone else
one sec
I was thinking of Alexa Azarian
but yeah, Aleksandra does pose weird questions
All. The. Time. And it’s almost either a question that either is very personal or posed to a group that would have no way of answering it
Like _asking nonwork foodies how to use a Dutch oven for stew_
Instead of looking up a recipe
we are apparently her personal Google
lol
nice
flatten_the_party_curve
guess all the corona emoji haters have left the emoji channel
LOL!
She doesn't read emails I take it
Good morning 
Good morning 
Good Morning to you too!
Good Morning
Good Morning
I feel like a slave... all I do is cook and clean and take care of baby...
Welcome to parenthood!
Wait till you go back to work?
I don't imagine working from home feels too much different than cooking and cleaning and taking care of a baby
It’s different for CJ because he doesn’t clean and cook... save me
Make CJ clean and cook. 
She doesn't like the way I do those things
so I'm not allowed
how different is the way you do things?
trying to decide whose side I'm on here
or like why doesn't she like the way you do it?
I'll admit to be a lazy cleaner, but as a foodie she doesn't like the fact my meals are simple generally throw it in the crockpot and call it a day simple!
get a cookbook
and some spices
However in all fairness, she's messy and it makes it hard to clean
My strategy for cleaning is straight to the dumpster!
psshhhhh, just add garlic doug! Garlic makes everything better
so like, she leaves a book out in the wrong spot, and you trash it as your way of cleaning?
does garlic make chocolate better?
garlic is a good start
how about mint ice cream
No, more like she has boxes that she might some day need, or she fills every space with stuff
You know, I don't know but i'll try it
are you calling her a hoarder?
No i'll die if I do that
no, for chocolate you want chipotle. for mint ice cream, you want some sort of anti-mint, because mint sucks
Mint is wonderful!!
She's... a city girl, and I have more minimalist aesthetics
Actually, spicy chocolate is a thing. I don't know about chipotle pepper specifically, but it might actually be pretty tasty
Mint chocolate chunk or chips ice cream is the best
CJ idea of cleaning is if I don’t see it then it’s clean 
Yeah I mean, a crockpot recipie can be better if you simply add more than a paltry amount of one spice.
yeah, I've had it before. I was referencing a readl thing.
<https://www.tazachocolate.com/products/chipotle>
Ah, sorry took it as sarcasm
He’s lazy he doesn’t add spice
MSG = everything better
true
Yeah, I can understand wanting to only cook lazy things (no beef wellingtons for you), but being too lazy to bust out 3-5 spices is indefensible
you know what's awesome in a crockpot? Throwing in a bay leef.
Salt, Pepper, Garlic, Onion Powder is basically all I ever use. Wouldn't even know when to use other spieces
Live with a cuban, can confirm
Paprika is about as versatile as the other 4 you just listed. I don't use Onion powder just about ever
I couldn't even tell you what paprika tastes like
I use onion power in burgers. Not sure why. Just how I was taught to season the meat
It's a way to get onion flavor in burgers without actually chopping up or adding an onion on top
It's not wrong to use it
will try this out tonight, how long do I cook this bay leaf?
Until level 32, when it becomes Meganium
Cook burgers with soy sauce as well as the onion power.  
maybe spice mixes are the answer
Old bay is the spice of the gods
Indisputable fact right there
I only ever use soy sauce in stir fry
Shut down through at least May 15.

Makes sense
Im getting used to this- to working from home and being unhappy.
yeah...
What, if anything, are people using to disinfect their phones and other electronics?
Currently looking at my phone and over ear headphones after going to the grocery store
I bought a "phone bath" before the stay-at-home order started. you put your phone in an it blasts it with UV for 5 minutes
<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZTV56JN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1>
just drop them in your bathtub with a toaster; the virus will die by electrolysis if the toaster is plugged in
Used for the low low price of $218...
They’ve gone up in demand since I bought mine. 
seems a bit overkill. Cant you just grab some alcohol from CVS for like $1, dab it on a cloth, and wipe it down?
You actually have to cut it before you just wipe it down
I don't understand what that means
You can't just put alcohol solution directly on a cloth and wipe with it. It is too strong. So you mix it with a certain proportion of water
the stuff you buy at CVS comes in 2 varieties, 70% and 98%+.
the 70% isopropoyl is just fine
Yes, 70% is rubbing alcohol, which you still have to cut
Not from what I am seeing.
another common suggestion is just clorox wipes

Please help me, there's a joke song that plays as the "Boyfriend review" title comes up, and I can't figure out where the original joke was from, and I'm not figuring out what to type into google
That is from spongebob

Ah, the training episode. Thank you! Thought it was spongebob, but wasn't sure in what context or anything

Did you see the protests in Michigan?
yup. Stupid as hell
damn I'm confused
damn I'm confused
I thought it was Friday all day
here I am thinking I don't have work tomorrow
:trying-to-look-like-youre-thinking:
C&amp;C 4 feels very unpolished compared to C&amp;C 3
C&amp;C 4 was a desperate last stand for what was an amazing franchise :f:
Considering Red Alert 3 was nearly as bad, yeah that sounds about right
Seems the last good games in the franchise were generals and 3
Generals was the last one I played hardcore, I'm kinda sad how the franchise died
It also helped that during that time I had a broken leg
Do you have a copy?
I'd play some, especially if we can dig up some custom AoD maps
Though I've seen people rave about Homeworld: Remastered

God I have no idea where the copy is...

<@UDDE5960N> I need you to top this over the next 5 years: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzZC6Pz8VTQ>
Awkward
Man, the amount of messes that have to be cleaned up for scripted Tik Toks like this. 
Hilarious though
I’m currently playing Avalon as Merlin. I tried to throw suspicion on Oberon after he failed a mission and he responded with, “Why does everyone think I’m bad all of a sudden?” The response from everyone else is playing was “No one thinks your bad, it’s only Marla.”
so if we win all the missions, I will be the clear person to assassinate. I hate everything.
That sucks
I feel your pain i like being Merlin the least
So I decided to chop my hair off this morning
Gave myself a bit of a buzz cut
nice
set for a few months then
I think you underestimate how fast my hair grows
but yeah, should be good for awhile
Good Morning Everyone!
Good Morning Everyone!
Good morning, about 5 years after it started and after countless recommendations, I'm finally listening to Adventure Zone
I hope everyone is having a better morning than Mei, Ashley and I
What's Adventure Zone?
Sorry you're not having a good day. Hopefully it'll get better?
D&amp;D podcast with the podcast brothers that do my brother, my brother, and me
Huh, interesting redacted word
Ashley decided to test her rolling skills while mei was changing a poopy diaper. Hungry/diaper change baby&gt;Dirty/hungry baby&gt;bath/hungry baby&gt;cold/hungry baby&gt;finally happy baby
So they play characters that represent your family?
Yeah, I've heard babies are picky about their temperature...
It's just a family playing a dnd campaign, but the family members started a comedy podcast like 15 years ago, so its pretty funny
got it
Impromptu bath time is not surprised she got cold.  Usually we do a lot of stuff to prep going from wet baby to dry happy baby. Which we didn't do because poo was everywhere
It may be too soon...but there are funny complications on YouTube of babies getting suddenly messy
Pics or it didn't happen
messes are funny if someone else is cleaning them up
messes are funny if someone else is cleaning them up
It’s a good one. 
I wish I wasn’t the one cleaning it up
/roll 1d20 + 3
:punch:
I was strongly considering doing the same
Sam told me no
So guess you'll see me with the longest hair I've had since high school
Get Sam to cut your hair then
I wasn't styling my hair because what's the point
So I cut it off
She refuses
<@UDDE5960N> wouldn’t let me cut his hair
I'm not sure I blame him :hmm:
You seem to share a sense of humor with me to an extent
And I wouldn't let me cut CJ's hair
LOL
that
WTF is a struggle truck?
kinda like the struggle bus
but with rednecks
Hey now, we had busses in podunk Oregon
liberal-again is a great emote
spongebob-mock
bot's broke
what's it from?
Secret Hitler
Is this a test or you genuinely didn't know?
not broken
bot just doesn't trigger off bot actions anymore
genuinely didn't know
to keep things from going infinite
only really played secred voldemort
OH MAN I MISS SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES!!!!
I don't
I genuinely like them. Just hard because a lot of people get roped into them that aren't there for it
and how can it go infinite, if it is only allowed to post on empty threads
yea i don't really miss them either.
It just made me sad cause I realized how long it has been
oh, there is a false in the condition. must have been leftover from testing.
Yeah, they are fun when you get the right group
If i could always be on the good side, I would enjoy them more.
lol
ok, its back on
Who in this channel does genuinely enjoy social deduction? CJ, me, Doug, Phoebe, Caroline, Marla...who else?
Ben. He's technically in the channel
I think Chris does
I think Prady does
Kind of 
me
Eh, I only counted people who are active. So Aysh counts. Ben meanwhile is dead as far as I know since I never see or hear from him despite the pings <@UEA7LHFQS>
Pretty sure he left Wayfair
Ok, that's good for him, and also WHY WE HAVE THIS SLACK
He did leave Wayfair he also said he would be more active
LIES ALL AROUND <@UEA7LHFQS>
wow cut the guy some slack. there is literally a global pandemic happening right now
Oh yeah, well guess what. <@UDTR9SLN4>, please say hi
I'm not sure I've played many social deduction games to know if I like them or not
We can fix that probably with an app and discord voice chat
roll20 lets you deal a deck of cards. That could work. I'm not sure how the game would do over voice chat. Seems like it would make the discussions take a lot longer
oops, left myself on the megamoji test list.
I like them A LOT in the right group. When people try hard tho, it's a good bit less fun
Or if people get upset by losing/are just playing to win. Playing them with my cousins and co-workers were great groups
<https://avalon.fun/login> ???????????
Nice. 
I second Dave’s opinion

Random note but we are postponing our wedding celebration to next year :)
more time to plan :slightly_smiling_face:
Cool. Any interest <@UTX6E7LLU> <@UDDE5960N> <@UDTR9SLN4> <@UTFFJEJ6P>?
OF COURSE!!
YES please :pray:
omg who can say no to avalon!
How well does it work?
Very well
a few of my friends had try a few times before it would let them make a username, but once they did that the game was very smooth
We did the same thing, Mei. We were supposed to get married a month ago and postponed until September, but I’m having more and more doubts….
hi
Am I proving a point? :confusion:
I mean, the game is mostly talking anyway, and we can just do that over zoom or hangouts or whatever. The website just implements dealing out the roles, night phase, voting, etc
Hopefully the doubts are about COVID-19 :slightly_smiling_face:
Hahaha we will see if my venue will still be available next year or not
Lol! Well I got the kid now do I really need CJ? 
It's weird chaos seed pinged me even though the thread was based off a comment of mine...
Yea for me it would be hard to send out invite by the time my invite place start printing again and not sure which boarder will be open up again so it will be hard for friends to get visa and etc. too much stress so I postpone to next year for the celebration
Also, you really shouldn't use zoom, they had over 500k accounts leaked to the dark web last week and my company says they're a major security risk and we're not allowed to use it for work and recommended not to use it personally
I mean at least until the baby gains the ability to wake you up while you are asleep, it's probably good to keep him around
Ooh, I didn’t think of all the international guests you might have. We are just doing electronic invitations anyway
haha, yes
I wanted to do electronic invitations but there are a lot of people who doesn’t have email.... also CJs mom really want a paper invite. It cost so much $$$
I wanted to do electronic invitations but there are a lot of people who doesn’t have email.... also CJs mom really want a paper invite. It cost so much $$$
Did you get your dress already? 
Hahaha True
Yup, cause that's how it is done! See <@UEA7LHFQS>!
That's what my friend who works at Microsoft was cautioning against
I'm sorry your wedding got postponed! 
On the plus side, congrats Marla, didn't realize you were engaged!
Microsoft have their own issues, but from a security standpoint it is better, data standpoint, eh
Lol
Morning folks
Morning folks
Good Morning Dakak
How are you doing?
Its so annoying to get messages in announcements-global and 8 am about some stupid 'standup'
Not too bad. Really need to work on my sleep schedule. My new team is up so early with this new schedule since they live far from the city, but no longer commute
I have the channel muted. 

You can also set a do not disturb schedule so slack won’t notify you before a certain time. 
its annoying even when muted'
i thought its for important stuff, not for ;join us for a virtual happy hour'  bull
Oh, yeah. That is true. For the number of people it seems pings they aren’t the most judicious with it. 
Plus, all that info comes in an email as well. 
they set it up when they had that emergency o water thing in copley and needed a way to announce something to everyone. look what theyre doing with it
Yeah, if there was really something important it’d be a bad way to get the information out now, I m sure a fair number of people ignore that channel now. 
Ok, would people be opposed to discord? Or do we need video to pull this off?
I'm not opposed to discord, I generally prefer it actually over many of its competitors
I feel that. Not in the same way, but I am trying to motivate myself to actually get stuff done and not just sleep in every day. Some days I get up and am super productive, and others I stay up watching shows or playing games and sleep in cause "why not?!"
Thought you weren't going to play because you don't like social deduction games?
someone in WF can send google meet invites to people. They just have to accept in people from outside WF. Its what I've been using for video for DnD
I stay up regardless of whether I need to get up in the morning
It's a problem
My average has been like 2-3am
I'm not quite as bad as that
1 am is my normal
I’m old now I go to sleep at 8-10pm 
Uhhhhh yea I like sleep too much
I'm kinda with Drew, I like keeping my social things not dependent on who I work for.
Its not dependent. When someone has access to it, they can use it for the group. When no one does, you switch over to something else. Meet is just a service I've been finding to be reliable.
I have a personal gsuite account
if you want to use that
Every morning i regret not sleeping at 10, and every night at 10 i refuse to go to bed. Morning Me and Night me hate each other.
We're throwing a lot of options out there without first establishing if people need video in the first place
Because if we don't need video, we can just use discord and that solves that, especially since this slack already has a discord for people to join and use
If we need video, then bringing up the other options makes sense
Dakota, you might want to see a doctor or something; I find that I'm the same person from day to day, regardless of the time of day
Ur weird
My team has not moved our schedule up any, even without the commutes. So I'm pretty solidly on going to bed at 2am, waking up around 8-9. not having to be functional until 10
no u
This is quickly going to turn into a "Good night!" the same way we had a "Good Morning"
if you insist
I'll be sure to tag you in them
ok Drew, every once in a while you'll get some pings at 4am
just be sure you check if he's on do not disturb mode and DM him if he is with a link to the message
video not really necessary- we can reconsider if it doenst work i guess?
I'm asleep by midnight. 4am is when I wake up if I had a bad night of sleep, like my computer waking itself up from hibernate to perform an update
I'm talking more a "It's 10pm, go to sleep Daka!"
nah, I like my interpretation better
its hard to sleep when the president tweets about executive orders stopping immigration at midnight :confused:
its hard to sleep when the president tweets about executive orders stopping immigration at midnight :confused:
iiogtmmrian :thoinkies:
immigration?
lol immigration yes :smile:
aysh, are you having a stroke?
i smell burnt toast
:siren:
are you making toast?
The president was literally Tweeting to Liberate several states a couple days go. The man is insane
insane people with power can do a lot of damage :disappointed:
but yes i agree
also yes i AM making toast
is it burnt?
Wait, i though trump was trying to re-open the economy, why ban immigration if the country is opening back up???
He's like the Red Queen:
&gt; Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
just in this case add contradictory to impossible
It's because he doesn't like immigrants (unless he marries them) and prolly wants 'muricans to stimulate the economy as 'murica don't need outside help
The stated goal is to protect american jobs as the economy re-opens. Of course that's nonsense that doesn't understand how the economy actually works, but its a strong enough soundbite.
It's to please his base I guess
Trumps just full on crazy pants, there's no logic just :like:
I disagree. I think there is a lot of logic. but that’s not any better, for the logic is cruel.
I hope today is a better day than tomorrow for everyone :slightly_smiling_face:
I hope today is a better day than tomorrow for everyone :slightly_smiling_face:
? What’s wrong with tomorrow?
:worriedpoop:
Yea now i'm scared about tomorrow
ITS ONLY WEDNESDAY AYSH!
:same:
i totally meant to say 'yesterday' but my pre-coffee brain predicted the future
Haha :)
Pre-coffee brain all about making you sound dumb
~Billy Pilgrim~ Aysh Raajasekar has come unstuck in time. 
I dunno, if you extend "tomorrow" to just " a day in the near future" I can easily predict today being better than that day
I dunno, if you extend "tomorrow" to just " a day in the near future" I can easily predict today being better than that day
but this isn’t something she’s predicting. Its something she hopes for.
accidental prometheus
Wouldn't the phrase "I hope today is the best day ever" imply the same thing?
yeah. its pretty dark. Never wish that for someone.
Seriously, we didn't add "i s" to the ban ban list?
That shouldn’t be an accident. The spam bot will trigger for anyone. Its more the replacement bots that are restricted to the chaos users.
I’ll check
why would you want to?
it's not used all that often
I hear people wish that all the time without thinking about the implications
no i meant i send an accidental gloomy greeting
why would you want to?
But, if today is the best day ever, that doesn't mean tomorrow cannot be better
oh, right. you become summon the silent. true true. :slightly_smiling_face:
uhh, doesn't it?
ever implies future, right?
We use the ban ban list to get rid of common words. That "i s" a very common word
Today is better than tomorrow lol 
that isn't my understanding of the purpose of the ban ban list
...what's your understanding?
“is” was not on the list. I added it
words we don't want to see banned
I suppose you could read it either way.
`I hope today is the best day you have ever had`
`I hope today is the best day you will ever have`
but my opinion on what that covers doesn't match yours
Yeah, such as "as" "and" "or"
We need to take genie stories more seriously. Always word your wishes very carefully.
what makes "i s" any different?
I actually don't mind is being ban banned
was curious what your reasoning was
but there are common words that I do want the ability to be banned
I understand that's how you feel. The why was the part I am curious about
like pronouns
I think most pronouns are on the list
I personally think pronouns should be bannable
I/he/she/they/we being banned causes chaos
Then what puts a word onto the ban ban list for you?
a word that it being banned doesn't cause chaos, just annoyance
like this/that
you can easily read around it
"i s" squarely falls into that category
whereas he/she/they/we/I make the sentence ambiguous as to who the subject is
so do most pronouns
I think from how much this word gets banned today, shows how it deserves to be on the ban ban list
I don't think volume is a good indicator
To me the chaos of the banned word was the game of figuring out what the hell it was each day
Fair, but the point being that I am too easily able to read around it and figure it out
for "is" i agree
as I've said already
You can totally read it two ways. That's kind of the point of genie stories
/roll 1d20 +1
Indeed, I just think this applies to pronouns just as easily
Story time!
Listening!
But if he tells the story to us, does that mean we’re the zombies?
`It is safe for all of you to assume that we will not be returning to the office the first week of May and that a return will likely be phased gradually over a period of time.`
I’m going to be stuck in this apartment by myself for months.
A projection I saw today doesn't think mass will start opening things again until early June
Sam saw the same thing a few days ago. I tend to agree it won't be till then. It's already till about Mid May anyway, so what's another couple of weeks tacked on in response to how long the peak is
uuuggghhh
Interested in some Civ Doug?
Its not a lack of things to do. I literally have something every weeknight this week. Last week too.
Totally get that. Have you been able to go outside for walks or to grab food?
I’ve been able to get out for some walks. Although there are still a fair number of people around jogging, so I try to go out when its dark so there are fewer people around.
Makes sense. Avoiding people is still a challenge
Soooooo I'm confused about why you're sad being locked in your apt alone? It's not the lack of human interaction you have that. Is it the fact you are locked, and you can't roam free?
Because video chatting with people is not the same as seeing them in person? Because I don’t have even casual touch? I have interaction, but it’s not the most human. 
Now I just have an image of Doug being out of this and just shaking hands or hugging everyone he can
Ok, I was just curious. I don't think touch is something I consider super important. (But who knows if I was locked inside forever without it)
That sounds.... crazy
I don't think it is crazy, or at least something that isn't readily understandable if you are starved of even the most basic of human physical interaction
I think touch is very important
maybe not over the short term
but over the long term, definitely
Curious though, if you're normally someone who doesn't appreciate physical touch from others, what physical interactions do you have normally that are now missing? I've never known Doug or Daka to be much of huggers. There would be handshakes and...
A little can go a long way. Handshakes, patting a shoulder. They’ve done studies on this. Too little contact leads to worse health. 
And just because I wasn’t hugging you doesn’t mean I don’t hug anyone. :p
The crazy part was drew's idea, not the Doug missing touch part
I would say I'm generally reserved when it comes to touch
but I still think it's important
Doug, I'm gonna come give you a *BIG HUG* when I see you next
That's all fair. Was pure curiosity as I'm who I think of on the other extreme that has a lot of physical interaction normally from hugs to handshakes, shoulder pats and what not. So was wondering what someone on the other side misses when they normally don't engage in it in the first place
Just get him a shirt that says free hugs
We all know Daka got his physical interaction in by dragging drunk people home
lol
Man Daka being on lock down means sooo much less Daka
Yeah, and I forgot to tell him to go to bed already last night
I guess when I'm talking about this, I don't mean handshakes
Hugs are the shit
I don't think I could ever be a bachelor my whole life
True, and that's the part of the conversation I'm curious about: what do you do for physical interaction as someone who is generally reserved when it comes to touch, when outside of a relationship?
Slack activity has gone down on all the nonwork channels within wayfair as well.
As someone who generally doesn't like physical contact (hugs, handshakes, shoulder pats, etc) except for close friends and family, I have noticed that I am missing it a bit
I don't, which is a problem
Everybody just slacking off doing things around the house now instead of slacking of on slack
A problem regardless of pandemic circumstances?
yeah
I don't seek out that kind of interaction outside of relationships
but it's important to my mental health once you go beyond the short term
Right, so does that mean you are constantly getting into relationships, or do you eventually hug someone when it's been a while between them?
Silence Chaos Seed
the former, or seeing my mood decline
I tend to go in cycles
depends on how much time I have free in my life
I was in discord calls all afternoon yesterday, i wouldn't have noticed till this morning
Not the first time you've brought it up
Being in a relationship is so much work
It can be, but it can also be worth it
Daka go to bed sooner
At one point, I was in a long distance relationship, and I actually enjoyed it a lot
Sorry, i'm still morning Daka. I fully agree to go to bed early.
What does afternoon have to do with 10pm?
I've generally found that I need more alone time to unwind than most people I date expect
CJ was my long distance relationship 
Discord calls all afternoon!?!?!?
Afternoon -&gt; 12:30AM
How much does that generally turn out to be?
Talking hours or days?
I agree with Doug it's crucial to our well being, I just find it interesting that people are craving this, when other things like say sleep will get ignored
hours, not days
but when my typical time to unwind is before bed
that tends to not mesh well
Yeah, can see how that would get in the way
Sleep? I don't really think sleep is much of an issue at the moment. Not really much else to do
More so saying that lots of people chronically go without enough sleep
:raisedhand:
Hmmm I see that as more of a concious decision to sleep less
Yea it can be hard for introverts to get the necessary amount of separation and cuddles
Sleep has been my problem. More that I've been letting myself go to bed at all sorts of different hours, and that may be enough hours, but does not equal enough of a rhythm
Mei drives me crazy because she's a night owl
it's a weird balance
I get it, and I'm sure you can all find people crazy enough to be out in person right now
There are moral issues around going out right now
So that goes back to, your making a conscious decision to forgo physical interaction
true
But you could still do it
...you of all people bringing up the morality of this is highly interesting
drew you beat me to it
I was typing something similar
wait what???
historically, daka hasn't cared much about the moral aspect
I mean I'm not much to talk about it because there's a little one that will cuddle me to death for the last month
lol
if he felt he needed the interaction, he would go out and get it
Doug is on Chaos seed now?
or that's my impression
I get the timing
Nah. Morals only become hazy in extreme situations. I don't qualify this as extreme
I'm just more interested about what
Like is it minecraft?
the amount of time you use "your" instead of "you're" is both aggravating on the tiniest level, and something I know I just have to live with
I will not continue the conversation about finding where you draw the line
Awwwwwww
lol, I was more talking about `he felt he needed the interaction,` not the pandemic
that's his `extreme situation`
Therefore pandemics are not extreme according to daka
NEED TYPE FAST HERE!
:finger_up:
CJ cuddle with the baby for 6 hours on purpose 
:finger_down_objection_withdrawn:
Yeah, the more this conversation goes on, the more inconsistent and interesting it becomes
Only a problem if you were craving some of those hours with the baby
Jealous
Mei is more than happy to get rid of Ashley
Feeling like I need human intreaction is not enough to start going against morals.
So you're also on the I miss people boat?
Yessir
He reacted to Doug's post, thought that was already confirmed
Hence I kept bringing him up in examples
I mean if there was a way for you to come visit can cuddle I'd be ok with it
I have seen 'cuddle parties' on meetup in the past- just platonic cuddling, apparently
I missed the react
My least favorite part about this is the duality of dating apps right now
Soon :smile:
I understand, CJ likes to hang out with his friends till 2am so I start sleeping at his places places lol
Yea... I'd be down for it if the people weren't creepy
They're the channel by which to get interaction, but you'd actually be hurting your chances by initiating now
WTF?
They're a solid channel by which to get interaction, but you'd actually be hurting your chances by initiating now
unfortunately, I have a huge mistrust of online dating.
Huh, so doesn't that make CJ the night owl?
Why? What apps have you tried?
None. I have a blanket mistrust
is this a word I'm just learning?
mutsirst?
Hurting your chances?
a single word was scrambled (new bot from Drew)
mistrust
yeah, most people on these apps aren't looking for a pen pal
in fact, when conversations go on for a long time without meeting in person, people lose interest in my experience
Yeah, and this is an indefinite not meeting up
you haven't been watching the megemoji test channel have you :lol:
Well that was new
oh I like that bot
Is that greek?
no idea
Nah, just chillin on discord with some friends back in chicago
The best luck I had on the apps were the ones that had a time limit, eg. Coffee meets bagel, after you match you have a week to meet up/exchange numbers, the app will prevent in app communication unless you pay
I've enjoyed hinge the most
And the thought of making a profile just feels so awkward.
it's only awkward if you make it awkward
browse a shit-ton of profiles on the dumb apps like tinder
and decide what it is that annoys you about those profiles
learn what it is you look for in a profile
try to put yourself into other people's shoes
what would make them interested in you
what makes you stand out in a sea of people
Yes, the new bot is Greek. In theory it can do more languages. I’m still deciding how to make it not too disruptive. 
it might be good to use a language with characters that we can read/pronounce
so it's like a: learn some new words in x language
Okcupid was ok a long time ago
Yes he a social night butterfly
That, or somehow fetch the phonetic  pronunciation along with the translated word
I liked it more with characters we don’t use. makes it pop more.
I could throw that at the end. That might disrupt sentence flow the least.
It's where the most important but hardest to follow things live
I like phonetic pronunciation
&gt; maybe put it in one of these after a newline

Yeah, and this is an αόριστος not meeting up
&gt; αόριστος: [[indefinite]] (phonetic pronunciation)

Brenden's third person bot gets me every time
one of my better creations. never had any luck with online dating it was more like screaming into the void
Good luck with your wedding in September! I’m rooting for you <@UDTR9SLN4> 
Sam has named the Greek bot to "Calliope"
Thanks!
&gt; maybe put it in one of these after a newline

Yeah, and this is an αόριστος not meeting up
&gt; αόριστος: [[indefinite]] (phonetic pronunciation)

Or "Callie" for short
I hang out with people, and sometimes that goes late on the weekend. Mei gets all her energy at night so she wants to clean at 10pm instead of get ready for sleep
<@UK7V13DS7> Yeah, I have a dress. I have everything actually. The wedding was supposed to be March 22nd. We canceled with 1 week to go
if anyone has need for 250 wedding programs that say “Marla &amp; Jason, March 22, 2020,” hit me up
Or even better, borrow a date stamp and stamp your new date over the printed one, save money, remember the struggles you both had to go through to get to new date, make the programs even more of a keepsake
I would just cross out the date and change to new date with a sharpie whenever you are bored. 
haha. Do we really think people will be comfortable gathering in september?
Unless something changes, I'm going to a wedding in October
So can't imagine an issue with September
:fingers_crossed_intensifies:
Do you have your dress <@UK7V13DS7>
ok, there will sometimes be pronunciations. Google doesn’t always provide them.
I would much prefer to have video
I just assume everyone keeps it muted since getting a series of test messages isn’t so interesting.
We planning on still getting married formally in august, but we're pushing back the big celebration till next year
And yes, she has 3 of them! (That I'm aware of)
so video it is!
the language in these WFH update emails makes me feel like 'you arent a caregiver, so you can come in'
Yea, fuck you guys not reproducing
even the performance related mails have that vibe
Cool, so we have options for that. Doug has an option for that, and since he would be one of the people playing (I assume), we should use that option
The performance related email opened up a whole world of panic
How many people for the smaller formal wedding?
Sweet, Callie is a fun bot
why so?
Sam can’t just rename my bot.
Yeah, that can be a pain. I'm apparently a person who is a morning person and a night person, but most definitely a "fuck off it is 3pm" person.
Sam is most definitely the opposite of that
Did you look up "Calliope?"
I know who Calliope is
I mean, you can name it what you want. Whether it gets called that or not is another story
See <@UDC4QL95G>
but my name is a joke. Even when it pops up in Russian you can say “its all Greek to me”
I'm very curious as to these fuck you emails
I just skim over anything mentioned caregivers since it doesn’t apply to me, so I’ve missed this vibe
I honestly didn't get that vibe
Because they leave so much open to your manager so if you're worried about your manager your scared
`We will accommodate all parents and caregivers of young children who need to work from home through this end-of-June time period. We are also taking government and health agency guidance into careful consideration as we think through the return of our teams to the office. It is safe for all of you to assume that we will not be returning to the office the first week of May and that a return will likely be phased gradually over a period of time.`
looks like there was a timeout in the delete process. Not really anything I can fix.
They're reassuring caregivers that they'll be accomodated, while also not committing to a timeline at this time
At least I set it to fail on the side of double posting instead of just deleting the message entirely.
It's why I actually guessed it was Greek at first
`For many employees we expect that there will be no meaningful change in expectations, but for those who have had significant disruptions in your ability to get work done, there should be alignment on what's most important to deliver and updated timeframes for delivery.`
That's a scary part of an email
Right but Aysh is more taking it as, we care about Care Givers, not you non-care giver people
that's not specific to caregivers
no worries it's a big message
Like would I be part of it, despite not being a caregiver, because I have Asthma?
if you're impacted while WFH they're trying to make accomodations
To be fair, those came from 2 different emails
I basically told my boss that I'd be taking longer lunches because I actually have to cook now
But those are the pieces that people are referring too
Got to know your joke phrases
So I make Mei go to sleep with me
my bosses fairly often have to mute themselves mid question to deal with a kid interrupting/questioning
So I make Mei go to sleep with me
Oh man, I don't want to know their current process
I totally apprecaite their efforts. Ive been following up on conversations in the eng managers channel and questioning how warehouse/ call centre employees are being accommodated for and I am generally impressed by this
Or cutting physical checks, things like that are tough at home

Lot of physical doc work in that department
PDFs too
PDFs too
I've got some team members who have had to shift their hours to later in the night when their kids are settling down.
As little as 3 as many as 5

I think that particularly affects other groups whose work doesn’t translate as neatly to wfh as ours. I’ve got a friend in accounts receivable who’s been having a hard time working as effectively

CJ you're the worst
I'm ok with this
My manager’s kids are constantly running around screaming in the background. We’ve all just decided we think its more funny than annoying.
but the performance strategy mails all bear titles about 'guidance for managing caregivers' or something along those lines which make it seem like they dont apply to non-caregivers (And Doug is one example of how that is easy to assume) while in reality there are non-caregivers who are affected by the situation.
Ah, so a very small ceremony indeed
For the record, we're included in that count
I know people who have anxiety issues that have been exacerbated by this,
People who are worried and constantly speaking with older but far-away family members.
I personally told my manager that I could not be productive  because of the immigration related stuff that was happening yesterday

performance is affected whether youre a caregiver or not, and wording it this was makes it seem like that doesnt matter
I went russian personally
I’m not sure I hope it be better by then.
I think that particularly affects other groups whose work doesn’t translate as neatly to wfh as ours. I’ve got a friend in accounts receivable who’s been having a hard time working as effectively
and Ive tried to raise this a couple of times but the ones who are more senior and making these decisions are predominantly caregivers so I think the nuance is lost on them
Then wouldn't it have to be min 5, 2 ppl getting hitched, 2 witnesses, 1 person doing the ceremony?
Oh man, I don't want to know their current process
Lot of physical doc work in that department
Yes CJ is the worst. Whenever we have to hang out with people late. I just sleep there. 
Wait, to be clear, you make Mei go to sleep before she wants to?
Yes he does... 
Even the most recent communication reads as if we are only doing remote work because kids are at home, not because there is social distancing and worker safety in play
She says this like she's not the first person asleep
That’s definitely not how I interpret either of those emails
Man, I don't think I've ever seen Aysh get this fired up before
I feel like you're reading too far into this
I feel like they're trying not to say anything, but had to about caregivers
haha no im not fired up :smile:
given what was announced
They did lead the last email about when we might come back into the office with talking about schools and childcare. That isn’t the primary reason to stay out of the office
Yes, but it may differ from the general guidance, so there's value in discussing it
if people are advised they can return before schools re-open, then they'd be in a pickle
this is to reassure them for the future general guidance
All school is canceled for the rest of this year. Poor parents
schools were just cancelled for the rest of the school year right?
public schools
daycare is also closed
All child care
The first two paragraphs of the performance email are
```Everyone is in agreement that we are navigating uncharted territory. Our first priority is supporting all Wayfairians during this time. We empathize with the unexpected challenges that we are all experiencing as we try to manage a drastic change to our daily routines, increased isolation from friends and loved ones, experience with anxiety over the health of loved ones and, for some, additional caregiving responsibilities.



The Performance Strategy team remains committed to ensuring that all employees receive high-quality, actionable feedback that facilitates their career growth and sustains our high bar, enabling us to deliver the exceptional experience our customers expect and deserve. At the same time, we are equally committed to maintaining equity in the review process, and to taking an individualized approach in situations where you and our colleagues are disproportionately impacted.```
We had to pay deposit to enroll her in daycare... 
how much does it cost to have your kid raised by wolves for a year?
1 child
Managers all received a directive to reach out to Talent relations if someone is unable to be productive during this time.
Throughout that guidance and in the title the word 'caregiver' is used (Title is *Best Practices: Managing Caregivers During the Remote Work Period)* but the content is supposed to apply to everyone
You make me go to sleep when I don’t want to otherwise I sleep wherever 
it created a little bit of unrest in the eng-managers channel, we were told we will receive guidance from the CTO that clarifies this- but it just never appened
*happened
Why does she have to sleep when you do?
Couldn't you just get a face mask and ear plugs?
..... because we both have to get up the next day, and someone forgets what time it is
let her live with the consequences of her decisions ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
if she's tired in the morning, that's negative reinforcement to staying up lat
For the record it also created unrest in the Wayfair parents channel
So it made non of the loud people happy
slack edit message functionality is broken and very frustrated
frustrating*
how so?
people didn't think it went far enough by being vague
and what would have been preferred?
In trying times just like you're talking about people would prefer to be told what they should expect, not it's up to your manager
Yeah, manager by manager is like doing a state by state response to a pandemic: fucking terrible
yeah true
Yeah, the more bots that happen, the less you are able to edit your own messages
What state are you getting marry in? In Massachusetts, I believe you don’t need witnesses 
Huh, I never heard of states not requiring witnesses...
no, outside of bot messages
Mine is being watch by a tiger right now aka my mom
I can't edit my own damn messages
Oh , I had that happen a few days back. After a few seconds my messages would turn grey and i couldn't edit them
grey?
no, the up arrow key shortcut just scrolls me way up to a random message in the channel
yeah, like the text would turn gray instead of black.
ctrl up does the same thing
oh that too
manually going to edit the message via mouse has the same functionality
very stupid
That's what mei says, I'll believe it when I see the paperwork
is it happening in the app or the browser? (I don’t have a fix or anything, just curious where its happening)
there are some scary marriage laws still in effect down south
Too many child marriages. ugh.
Not marriage related, but a law still on the books in SC says you're not allowed to have back pockets on blue jeans
oof, that’s cruel
that’s the best place for pockets
I mean, generally any pocket I have is worthless, but agreed back pockets are normally bigger/better
I think it has something to do with weapons
I don't think I've ever actually used my back pockets
I've never figured out a use for them
other than occasionally for my hands when standing in a certain position
They're my primary phone holder pockets, and I've only destroyed a phone once this way
i feel like it would be unconfortable to sit down with something like a phone in my back pocket
Oh, when I sit, the phone comes out and gets put on a table or lap
It's more when I'm walking around it's in the pocket
it's probably also much easier to steal something from someone's back pocket than the front one
Ugh, taxes suck:
Long story oversimplified:
-Got fired and with it, our health insurance
-In Mass, you need health insurance or pay a penalty
-Sam was self employed for just about all of that time, so we couldn't go on her non-existent plan
-By the time I got to a place of stability with my job stuff, I had missed the deadline to apply for the Massachusetts Health Insurance Marketplace stuff
-So we owed a larger penalty, because we could "afford" health insurance, that we could not procure, because they only have certain windows in which you can apply

and that penalty is basically 25% of what your health insurance premiums would have been for that time uninsured
Probably, but I've never been in that situation
doesnt the penalty not apply if you were covered for such a long period of time of that year?
also, didnt event 1 happen in 2020 so wouldnt count towards your 2019 tax filing?
I don't think he's talking about his bartending job
gotcha
I think he meant the healthcare job he was in for awhile
Brenden, you don’t keep a wallet in your back pocket?
Yup, the health care job from 2019 before all of the rest of 2019 happened with job stuff
left front pocket
The 2020 stuff is fine because after going through all this crap last year, we just got health insurance through the aforementioned marketplace so I would not be dependent on my employer
left is for wallet + keys
right is for phone
Mine is flipped, but the same items together
Left front - phone, right front, keys and earbuds. Right back, wallet. 
Front nothing (maybe a chapstick could fit...), back alternating phone, purse everything else
If it didn't get weird looks, I would totally use a purse
Yeah exactly
thats tough :confused:
thats tough :confused:
v tochku!
That sucks
Yeah, a $1200 swing in taxes is painful
Yeah, a $1200 swing in taxes is painful
Oktoberfest has been cancelled. It's in September
hm, disconcerting.
there might not be full social distancing for that long, but its clear that some measures will have to be in place for a decent while. Who knows when people will be packing stadiums or going to large festivals again. probably not until there is a vaccine.
Go to bed <@UDC4QL95G>!
Go to bed <@UDC4QL95G>!
Morning Daka will thank you
Don’t listen to morning you. Its night out.
Nah too eaely
Isnt' this when morning Daka wanted to be asleep by?
Yup
Morning daka can suck it up
Good night people mei is already fast asleep
Morning Daka is going to be cursing your name
that’s weird. The events log says it deleted the old messages. no errors.
GOOD MORNING <@UDC4QL95G>
Good morning 
Good morning 
Morning
Man that Night Daka is a real piece of work
it is morning!
and so it begins
<@UDC4QL95G> what time did you sleep?
oh, that’s a weird bug. I’m going to turn off that bot for now.
LOL!
<@UDC4QL95G> presumably Mei meant to ping you.
I slept around 1:00
Went to bed before I did.
Does Morning Dada hate Night Daka?
you slept earlier than i did Daka :smile:
That’s late
Its occurring to me that the T is the only way I have to get around right now. and if I’m ever in a spot where the T isn’t running, or I don’t think its safe to get on, then I could be stuck in the possibility of an emergency. Does anyone have an electric scooter or a folding bike or something like that which they like? I don’t even know if I’d use it that much, I’m just trying to think ahead of things a little. I’m generally not a prepper, but am now kind of seeing how some aspects of my lifestyle were a little precarious.
I don’t but I’m in the same boat so I sympathize 
I would go on the limb and say the t isnt really safe right now, there are many cases of riders and employees getting the virus
consider uber.
true. Uber is definitely an option. I guess I’m trying to think if there is an option that doesn’t rely on other people. or cell signal.
youve always been relctant to use uber, but it can be a true lifesaver
I bought a certified refurbished Glion Dolly near the start of social distancing
true. but what if I think I’m infected? Can I get into an uber to visit a doctor?
quite cheap; folds up and you can drag it behind you like a suitcase
does it handle uneven roads well?
if it won’t kill me on the first bump that looks like a good option.
shocks aren't great; I tend to avoid roads with lots of potholes
it's rather barebones on the ride smoothness front, but that's partially why it's so cheap
actually, another line of thinking, do you know what their legality is around here? Can you ride on bike lines with them?
I've been doing that
Haven't looked too much into the legality though'
Im bored of my food
I can sympathize with that.
every day is egg and toast
Soooo make something new?
Try something different
SEASON IT UP!
no no its egg and toast with pesto/ gochujang/ garlic/ cherry tomatoes/ indian spices

But its still boring
Yes but I'm saying try different spices
Throw so old bay on the bitch, do paprika and salt
SPICE OF LIFE!
cooking sounds like a valid suggestion
my lazy meal is also a breakfast sandwich
though I made myself some fried rice yesterday
I tend to add everything bagel seasoning to my breakfast sandwich
thats my every day lunch
I made sure to buy the best instant ramen I could, since I knew I was going to eat a lot of it. Still doesn’t solve the problem of getting bored with it.
did you also buy stuff to doctor it?
PB&amp;J or French toast have been my go tos
frozen vegetables/dried seaweed/furikake/dumplings/eggs
I’ve been using spice. have some frozen veggies to throw in there. I should have stocked up on eggs. That’s the big one I forgot.
Mostly by manipulating Mei
I might make a grocery trip today
it's been awhile for me
Mei loves to add spam, it works pretty decently if you can find any
I need to get some spam and nori
Mei should be on her grocery run, need to make sure she gets cercal for me!
I’ve not visited the grocery store yet. I have order out 2 or 3 times.
oh i saw some spicy korean instant  ramen 'challenge' and wanted to buy that
oh yeah, some of those are crazy spicy.
maybe my grocery run will be to C-mart
so I can get a bunch of frozen dumplings and ramen
or perhaps hong kong market
i was going to the walgreens next door for milk/ eggs but theyve closed and only the drive through is open
:hmm:
Dun dun dun!
can you walk through the drive through&gt; :stuck_out_tongue:
can one just  walk into a drive through?
lol can I?
normally no
oh :disappointed:
but with the main store closed? I have no idea.
hmmm homemade dumplings? :thinkies:
so much work to fold
but tasty
oh yeah- Mei suggested some veg korean dumplings. Mandu.
This weekend!
But really- I am SO tired of my food
everyday is: egg and toast, steamed veg, fruit, CANDY
I've def had to walk through a drive through atm before
ATM doesn't know it's a person the walgreens drive through will be manned
Also, I think the solution is to add variety here Aysh, because you eat the SAME THING every day
suggestions PLEASE
im going to make a ginger soy stir fry because HUNGAR
in my head, aysh is now a pirate
Have ceral and milk tomorrow
PB&amp;J
Stir fry some tofu
make some sadness and disappointment
Go on a juice cleanse
I hear it goes great with laying in bed staring at the ceiling
but in general, putting up with boring food is better than going out for ingredients.
it sucks.
I figure I'll go out for ingredients around once every 2 weeks or so
I need the pronunciation <@UDL020K8D>
the library doesn’t always provide them
it will appear when it can
well there's your problem; don't get your ingredients from the library
go to the grocery store silly
Finally living in the suburbs has some wins!
Much less dangerous to go shopping when everyone else is a potential vector
Get Peapod deliveries next month!
going to be honest, my grocery store isn't that popular now that no one is going to the offices near it
im ordering from alsi since thats closest for me, but their dont have much variety. ill maybe take a long walk this weekend
I’m going to try instacart when I finally run out of my ramen. We’ll see how it goes.
doug- are you surviving on ramen?
Get a backpack together go on an adventure!
GET POTATOES!!!
no solely, but largely.
There's so much you can do with them
:facepalm:  ok thats worse/ please use instacart
<@UK7V13DS7> you need to be in this chat
I still have some canned beans and fruits. I’ll be able to get through another week
hey, ramen is tasty
and I don't have any
and I miss it
and I made sure to get good ramen
yeah, my local grocer doesn't sell good ramen
so I have to go further
maybe I'll take a scooter ride today to go to an asian grocer
I bought a ton off amazon before we all shut in
ramen is VERY high in sodium
I'm just noticing now that the color schemes of our avatars are very similar doug
Yes, yes they are
lol
true. but I have asthma and a persistent cough. I really don’t want to go out shopping.
DELIVERY!
Also, can't help you all if you aren't doing regular grocery runs or grocery deliveries.
However, if any of you are looking for easy meals, and you don't cook much, happy to provide those
yeah, I’ve done that a couple times. Still trying not to do that often
I am curious what your go-to recipes are
grocery delivery. not food delivery.
back when I still had chicken in the house, I was experimenting with a pot pie like thing in my cast iron pan
ah, yes, I should do that.
Co-worker was doing that, apparently they activate at midnight
So just be fast on the trigger finger
i made some hot pot (from a tom yum paste) last week. was nice. but im out
So there's some mexican style dish on our weekly menu because that's my favorite type of food
-Tacos
-Fajitas
-Quesadillas
-Nachos

We also homemake pizza because it is easy.
Pork roasts or Gnocchi are literally our easiest dinners to make
After that, everything else we make I would say are more complicated
But the things I've listed so far are the highest ratio of Very Tasty/effort ratio
I mean I would argue if you have a slow cooker, that has the highest taste to effort ratio
Literally cut stuff up and dump it in!
Tacos really aren't much more than that
But if you want a slow cooker Lechon recipie (cuban pork), let me know
I need to learn to make pizza dough
I have a Mei, she's in charge of cooking because she gets sick of food before I will
Can give you the basic pizza dough we use.
Well I'll find out if the grocery store has flout/yeast left
Trader Joe's doesn't carry yeast year round, at least not the stores I've been to
Who said trader joe's?
Flour has been easier to get there though because they restock just about every night
oh, good to know
Still have to go first thing in the morning, but it isn't like Star Market who gets deliveries much less frequently
People hoarding groceries at the beginning made much more sense than now where it is still really difficult to get toilet paper and flour. Like, what the hell people?!
Just need to have a strategy, hoard toilet paper all the time, not just during pandemics
I buy like once a year or two
Costco?
no specific place
I follow slickdeals
and they do price-per-ply analysis over there
so when a good deal comes up, I restock
still have 2.5 large packs of toilet paper left
which will probably last me for a year
I should follow slickdeals
That was a bad reorder
Far too readable
speaking of: <@UDDE5960N> if you need daipers `<https://slickdeals.net/f/14002694-size-4-pampers-swaddlers-diapers-300-total-diapers-20-walmart-giftcard-15-prepaid-gc-77-58>`
Does the sun rise in the east?
I'm pretty sure even bikes are in a gray area legally. I'd be surprised if electric scooters were any better.
I wish they sold gas powered scooters like that. Electric scooters just don't last long enough, and they get slower as they lose charge
<@UDC03KCGK> the star market next to my place seems to be fully stocked like... all the time.
Probably a comination of lack of parking lot, and lack of college students in the dorm
<@UDC03KCGK> I'd love your lechon recipe, I have one my boyfriend uses but it's oven based
Last time I went to the Star Market near you dakota there was no toilet paper. Most other things. But that paper goods aisle was deserted
Only on days it sets in the west
Only on days it sets in the west
you don't need to be going faster than like 15 mph on a scooter
shits dangerous
Ah i never go by the toilet paper. I just look around for food
It's not about speed. It's about consistant output, and the ability to continue indefinitely as long as you have gas.
And in a situation where a scooter is my only option, I would rather not rely on the battery being charged and able to get me where I need to go
Does anyone here get the humble monthly bundles? There's a game from a few months back that I want to buy off someone, but don't really wanna go through the r/steamgametrades route
Yeah I do. I don't redeemost of them what game you looking for
Yeah I have humble monthly, though I have skipped a couple months. What game you looking for
I also leave a bunch of games un-redeemed, so there is a good chance I have the game
Fell Seal: Arbiters Mark. Was a few months back
It goes for like, $2-3 on gametrades and &lt;$2 on g2a, but I don't want to make a Reddit account haha
DM'd you the code.
+rep, fast and efficient trader, ty for the smooth trade
I haven’t minded most of them, the last ones were just particularly scary
the one on the right looks like a supervillain laughing during a monologue
left one is fine
How much is the game normally?
Go to bed <@UDC4QL95G>
Hmmm yeah i probably should
Morning Daka will thank you
When is everyone free for this?
It's $20 fill price, 10 on steam, but like, $2-3 on trades bc it was part of a bundle
Civ nights
Good Morning peeps!
Espcially morning <@UDC4QL95G>!
They are both scary
They are both scary
Hi I’m here :) 
I make sushi like Kimbap (korean style) or sashimi. Japanese chicken curry, very easy to make. Cereal or devil eggs for morning hehehe
I stocked up on ramen and eggs
What did you mean to say originally? I think there is a problem with the right to left language. 
Especially
but it got me before spell checker did
I mean what order were the words in?
Good morning everyone 
Did the bot mess that up in your message?
I got hit in the face by the baby
Yea, it actually did them backwards
Yea, it actually did them backwards
Intersting
That x
Cool because the langues is read right to left
Is the baby ok :see_no_evil:
I mean, that is your fault. Ashley is just a baby, she barely has control over her own limbs, yet alone able to accept fault
There is some unicode that is supposed to let you embed right-to-left text within left-to-right text. I think I have it hooked up now. we’ll see.
This feels like its triggering more than 1% of the time.
Yes Ashley is fine
Mei's pride is hurt but that's about it
At this point the baby probably doesn’t know that those failing parts are connected to it. The brain is crazy.
The baby is fine. Feeding a baby is dangerous
She was probably happy and doing happy leg kicks
Or angry, and doing angry get this away from me kicks
So would people be free this weekend? Doesn't have to be at night, could be afternoon
sure
Just her hands going everywhere 
Now I just have a heavy baby sleeping ontop of me
she just wanted to stretch!
sunday :pray:  working sat
I’m good with either day
I’m bored so I’m making kimchi now

how will they shoot is my question
They’re saying all in their homes. Maybe its like the last episode of Tiger King.
Although it’d be weird why April and Andy have different homes. hm, maybe that wouldn’t work.
like I can't comprehend how someone can feel this way
How do you spend hours laying in bed in fear/dread?
oh i know several people who have done that
theyre usually clinically depressed
maybe I just don't get depression
it's probably hard to understand until you experience it
Ever gone on a 10 mile hike and just wanted to lay there and kind of do nothing for hours? Or you think maybe you should get up to get some water or something but that just takes too much effort.
It's that, but you're also sad

It's that, but you're also sad
That is a different sort of depression than was being described above
I'm trying to simplify it for someone who "can't comprehend" how someone can feel that way by trying to simplify my own experience.
You missed this Gem Brenden `productivity very often goes hand in hand with avoiding grief and pain instead of coping with it. A lot of this productivity people are engaging in is simply a way to avoid breaking down. Speaking as someone who is actively doing this`
Ah, It was my understanding that the portion that was hard to comprehend was the `in fear/dread` part, which is not included in your example.
Hmm? I think there is truth in that
This sounds less like depression and more likely anxiety in my experience
specifically: `A lot o'this productivity people're engaging in's simply a way to avoid breaking down.`
Depression is the lack of... caring for a better word.  This is actively panicking about something you don't have control over.
I think anxiety may be a symptom of depression.
Depression has become a blanket term
It's what I have had described to me as "catastrophizing." Comes up a lot in OCD where you take something happening, and suddenly chain react it to everything else. Building mountains out of mole hills essentially. Where not paying rent, means getting evicted, which means having to move home, which means getting a different job, then getting stuck there, then never being able to leave, to being a burden on your parents, to then being homeless, then a bridge and goodbye.
I was going more with the `speaking as someone who's actively doing this` which just sounds pretentious
See now that I can understand! You should have led with that one!
lol
Anxiety and depression are 2 very different things. Mostly having dealt with both types of people. Sometimes results in the same outward behavior but for very different reasons.
My thought that depression is a condition, and anxiety is a symptom.
hm, that shouldn’t have happened. I thought I solved this interaction.
No they're both conditions
a lot of people diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with anxiety
different conditions though
also the lying in bed for hours probably includes scrolling on phone.
well that's dark
depression is an emergency exit only
i am actively in productivity! Woo!

Yeah, I can see that
nope
even after a 20 mile hike I don't feel like that
I might nap
but if I'm not sleeping, I'll be doing something
even if it's playing a game on my phone or reading a book
eat it
You clearly like your toast darker than I do. 
when I burn stuff, I try to eat it anyway as negative reinforcement
doesn't always work out, but I tend not to burn stuff too badly
so it's still edible
fire alarm went off
i had some extra dough so i managed lol
at one point, I almost set a grease fire because I walked away from the stove
remembered and came back just as it started smoking
Been I while since I’ve set off my smoke alarms. My place in Chicago they were so sensitive, you could hardly make soup without setting them off. 
What did you make?
It’s hard making bread 
nah this is flatbread and really easy. i think i learned at 10. but i got distracted by slack
We are a distracting bunch
Emergency exit only?
How about Sunday at 1pm-3pm? Just put an emoji :yes: or :no: so we can get a full response from the group
ok, Chaos seed is fully off the rails

idk. I’m going to try to figure that out now.
I haven't notice d it doing anything wrong
It posted in the channel twice instead of the threads
It has been posting in chaos monkey and not in threads for me
ohhhh
Another weird glitch
That I don't see but you do
I'm not seeing that happen
wait, are you saying it different for different people??????????
looks like a client side issue
yeah. It has happened before
well, you saved me an hour or two of chasing ghosts.
sounds like something we can’t address ourselves.
Can the news cool it with the "OMG Trump told people to drink bleach to cure Coronavirus" headlines.
um, no. The president telling people to drink bleach is a big dead.
Apparently he didn't, he asked if we can use disinfectant on surfaces, is there a way we can use a disinfectant on the insides, but talk to your medical professional before doing anything
Not really
I heard inject yourself with disinfectant
which sounds just balls out crazy
Something of the sorts, it was a crazy question, but the main thing is he asked if it was possible, not that you should
<@UDD45P5A9> you’re right, he didn’t exactly say you should do it. but considering his position, what he did say was incredibly irresponsible and dangerous. not to mention lacking a middle-schoolers level of safety awareness. to the point of being newsworthy.
Also lighting yourself up sounded hilarious
ugh, subjective reality ruining everything.

:open_mouth:
I agree, but this is trump we're talking about and most everything he says is irresponsible, but on the scale of what the press says he said vs what he actually said, what he actually said is slightly better
yeah, turns out there really was never any evidence that is random lupus medication ever did anything against a coronavirus.
Totally. What he did say was still stupid and dangerous, but he did not tell people to inject themselves with lysol
he literally told the doctors to test it.
That and internal UV lights, which seems kinda funny
He has that weird way of talking where he never actually tells anyone to do anything. Its always nudges and suggestions.
yeah, its mob-boss speech
only way to brush off accountability
except in a press briefing from the White House
<https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-bleach-company-warns-disinfectant-wont-cure-coronavirus-dettol-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;utm_source=reddit.com>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu60uj0_-Nw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1538>

here's what he said, from the live broadcast.
I looked up some stuff on the UV side. Its pretty interesting. It works by absolutely shredding DNA. That’s why it sterilizes so well, but in human cells causes cancer. There is some research happening now on tight-band UV which could not penetrate human skin, allowing for UV sanitation in public places without harming people. but its still theoretical at this point. and of course external to the human body.
sorry i missed a 0
wrong window
:slightly_smiling_face:
an elderly couple  took aquarium cleaning pills because that had some hydrocloroquine like derivative. People are stupid. Having a president  say stupid things like this isnt helpful.
we can laugh because we KNOW its a stupid idea
but there are people who think he's an all knowing billionaire businessman god
There have also been stories of Lupus patients unable to refill their prescriptions of hydrocloroquine due to people buying it up.
then again- bother's colleague who was treated with that has recovered
And unfortunately due to science, that could be entirely coincidental
His comics on stats are the best
I still have the poster from when he made the comic about tracking all of the money
Outdated now, but it was such a damn impressive feat
Ok apparently the first white house transcripts had Dr. what's her name saying 'thats a treatment' when Trump asked about injecting with disinfectant or tremendously powerful light
They corrected that later to 'not as a treatment'

Interesting. I'm all for accurate reporting and getting things right so people don't needle away at the bigger picture. 
The problem is the bigger picture is the President wants to speak to us about how to stay safe, and does not understand the very basics that a middle schooler would grasp about how a virus works. 
And he doesn't seem to really trust Fauci to speak for him about what they should do.
This time it was Dr. Birx who was around to try and clarify. Reaction video of her:

DnD group hasn't taken the slot so yes
I've decided that today is a day to curate my brand
Going to finally make an Instagram and populate it a bit historically
Among other things
/roll 2d20 -2
the gazebo hates my story :crying_blob:
'brand'?
ehh, it's a decent word for my public/semi-public online pressence
what would you prefer I call it?
why do you want a brand?
There will be information on me searchable on the internet; I can't control that
Since I can't control that, I may as well affect it as much as I can to be what I want it to be
Plus, getting ready for when it's time to use dating apps again
Some of the apps have Instagram integration, giving you more opportunities to make people interested
Damn it. There's now a younger kid that shares a name with me and he's starting to appear in searches in addition to me
Hahahahaha
I need a play by play of the branding of brenden
currently going through the past few years of pictures I have
done going through pictures through 2016
lol
I need to do that with my pictures too
instagram now populated with the ones I cherry-picked
requested that a site delete whatever data they have on me so it doesn't appear in search results anymore
Seems like there's a delay between when you reactivate an instagram account and when API access becomes available for app integrations with that account
Sounds like this whole brand is entirely in regards to dating, not in regards to work or networking. Was there stuff coming up that was of a foolish younger man?

That's unfortunate that this time does not work for Victoria seeing as she was one of the main reasons we got into to this discussion. <@UDD45P5A9> what time works better for you?
Also still waiting to hear from <@UTFFJEJ6P> and <@UDTR9SLN4>. Currently have 5 which is the bare minimum to play
Honestly between work and side projects, I wouldn't have much free time even without the virus right now
lol
Sunday evening or a weekday would be better for me
a bit of both; need to update my linkedin too
made sure that's what comes up when you google me
not this time; though there is a tiny bit of stuff related to an on-campus job that I'd love to get rid of
as well as some ski-racing stuff from &lt;10 year old me
quite awhile ago, yes
I should update that
I think that was during my second internship
back in college
Google thyselves and share results!
wait, where is that from
that's not on my linkedin anymore
alumni something
weird, they must have scraped it from linkedin a long while back
also weird how some of the image results are my coworkers
You have some pretty good photos. 
more than half of them arent me :smile:
I meant of the ones that are you. :p
Aysh can only find aysh
Aysh can only find aysh
but actually pic 2/3 &gt; 1/4
Interesting. What was the on campus job? Or would that make it show up and thus not suppressed anymore?

Your mistake was assuming I'd come up as "Drew"
Look up Andrew or Andrew W and you get more
I tutored CS related subjects
Nevermind. Nothing like a professional sports player to suppress your data. 
Kind of handy actually
Java, SQL, Android app development, Excel, some basic Assembly, basic web development
Why is it so important to get that scrubbed?
it's not super important
Hell, it's still on my resume
I mean, yeah, I can't imagine why it wouldn't be relevant career wise: know the stuff well enough to teach it. 
Plus if someone who you'd like to date wasn't interested in you because you were a nerd that knew programming...
Well
They are certainly gonna flee at literally everything else you do for fun
google searching has nothing to do with dating for me
that's more for professional stuff
hence why I like my linkedin up top
and not much else
Pretty interested in this:

already reached out the the realtor; this might be my next apartment
FYI that’s in the middle of where most northeastern students live
Thanks for the heads up; I'm not sure I care about that too much :hmm:
Unless there's a reason I should care?
I lived about a 10 minute walk up the hill for 2 years and it’s pretty much parties and screaming college students from Thursday-Sundays
Personally I would never move back to the hill
to be fair, it is on the border of roxbury and the hill

Or we can play today AND schedule a second session.

I love that pic
It's a nice apartment. Bedroom might be a bit cramped depending on which of the 2 you get.
That area is right down the street from where I worked at Brigham. It's on the cusp of where the nice longwood medical area turns into the more sketchy Roxbury side of things.
Great donuts across the street though!

If you feel comfortable walking around that area late at night, I can't see why you wouldn't go for it though. Super easy commute to Wayfair
Good Morning!
Man, trying to drag myself out of bed earlier leaves me real akin to the gif
lol
I'm also trying to get back to only having coffee on the weekends
Booo
Coffee is life
I just hate being dependent on it to start the day.
You're fucked drew
Once you start down the path of coffee addiction there's no coming back
Actually I pull myself back really quickly and easily. I'm not a person who gets overly addicted to substances with the sole exception of sugar
How do you make your coffee?
Espresso machine, or stove top espresso maker.
like a Moka pot?
Yep
is it a fancy machine that grinds it for you?
No, we buy pre ground espresso from the grocery store and put that into the filter holders, tamp it, then brew it (extract it? I'm not the guy you talk to about coffee, just alcoholic drinks)
I enjoy having a grinder. I think it helps keep the flavor fresh. 
hehehehe i figure your palate is sensitive enough to know whats good and whats ot good
*not
We have a grinder actually. Just only use it for the coffee we bought from a coffee shop in Maine because they only sold espresso whole bean.
I've definitely tried a bunch of different espresso types to find one that works best and tastes good. There's a reason so many place in Italy and France use Lavazza
false, I came back
well, it wasn't a coffee addiction so much as a caffeine one
I'm thinking about starting a p90x routine for the next month or two (insanity)
(in my living room)
As long as you have chk neighbors
*chill
BREAK ALL THE THINGS!
<@UTX6E7LLU> I think this has to be my favorite question from your favorite person :sarcasm: `Is there a way to check how much data I use per day?`
yeah, I was mildly irked by that
I haven't had any coffee since the office closed down. I just drink it cuz it's there
so long as I don't do this after 9pm or before 9am, I don't think I'm too worried about my neighbors
ok, I phone the question in regards to a phone is annoying. but you could take the question more generally. how much data do you think you use in a day? I’m sure someone much have made the estimation of how much data we access from our brains in an average day.
I’m seeing estimates that the brain could hold 74 terrabytes, and in daily life you could ingest 34 gigabytes daily.
seems like an oversimplified estimation
if we're converting our sensory input to data storage, what format are they stored in? how efficient is that storage method?
&gt; 1 synapse can store 4.7 bits of information
<https://elifesciences.org/articles/10778>
that's not the point
how many bits does it take to store X information
Information density must be pretty low. We do a lot of passive pre-computation. and you need a lot of environment data for spacial awareness.
but that’s what happens when you have the same machine be a computation engine, a self-driving vehicle, and an encyclopedia.
I've seen a lot of people try insanity. Personally I found the vanilla p90x to be better workouts, at least as somehow who didn't consider themselves in already good shape.
the difference is that I already have insanity on an external hard drive
I actually don't know how to check the data I use per day on my phone until I got a Google Fi plan. Then that shit just pops up on the app first thing
Ah, that'll do it
Either way, I think a workout video course like that can be really effective
I did some insanity during college and still have it on an external storage device too, maybe I should do it again...add it in the nonexistent free time
how much do you all pay for your phone plans?
Fluctuates. Depends on how much data we use, and the fact that we are still paying off both phones.
anyone here playing Animal Crossing right now? I see the fruits in the emote list. I see on the internet a bunch of people talking about it, but I’m not in it myself.
So as little as $94 for 2 people, as much as $144. Again, $37 or so are device payments. 
We're thinking of switching once the pandemic is over because Sam uses a lot more data than I do.
Nope. Played the original GameCube one back in the day, but eventually got bored of it and never been interested in going back. Offered to get it for Sam and she rightfully decided she didn't need another time suck in her life.
```Somerville folks: face masks/coverings are now mandatory, unless you want to risk a $300 fine/corona```
yeah, I somehow have less free time than usual these days.
so 94-144 inclusive of device payments?
A lot of my neighbors are gonna be fined then
are actual masks available for purchase yet? Best I have is a dishrag tied together with a UBS cord (works better than it sounds)
Online sure, I've been using a bandana when I go out
alibaba has a lot
so does walmart
(not N95 masks)
ain
Explain
oh yeah, not N95 or surgical masks
but like better than nothing masks
You got bamboozled by :dejavu:
Where is the dejavu emote from?
No idea. It's been around forever
some anime guy it looks like
oh, added by Jeremy Pope. He’s still at WF. I’ll ask him.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgu3G-gYxME>
reverse image search lead to this
looks like is is just an old meme
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv13gl0a-FA>

^ what Jeremy replied with.
oh, video unavailable. but at least it has deja vu in the name, so the connection is clearer.
Yes.
The $94 was because we only used 1gb of data last month between the 2 of us (cause you know, wifi and being home all the time)
I find people are more desperate to fill that time with any social interaction they can, and since it is harder to organize large scale digital groups, there's a lot more fractured individual calls and groups being formed
Like, I have had several calls with friends and family that I otherwise would not be trying to talk to outside of a trip or party had it not been for Covid-19 and people feeling more eager than ever to reconnect and schedule these things
Sam made a bunch of fabric masks there for a couple weeks. Mailed them off to some family members and kept 2 back for ourselves

oh
oh
:confused:
ithink this was me
lol
:D
now I understand why you were so interested
but yeah, this was a bot, not me
<@UDC4QL95G> what is the command for picking opting in/out of bots?
`/chaos`
This is exactly why this bot exists
does that actually connect to all the bots?
silence chaos seed
It use to
I know it connects to chaos seed. I didn’t think it actually connected to any other bots.
most bots don’t have that db connections written
<@UDC4QL95G> is the chaos command current set for us to try and aim the bots at mongo instead of the . py constants?
I wasn't planning on giving users the option to opt out of specific bots, but you could do that
more of a blanked "Am I allowed to have an impersonation"
but right now none of the bots are looking at the “Am I allowed to have an impersonation” thing.
(except chaos seed)
basically opt in/out of having your messages be deleted
correct, I never hooked up the user profiles in mongo to impersonations
if the impersonation thing is in a good place, I can start to switch over how impersonations are looked up.
The user object does store all user information though, including profile pictures, and i was planning on building a button with a another view to allow a user to set the name of thier impersonation
There is also '`chaos admin`
oh, its not even just holding a bool yes/no? interesting.
yeah, the opt in/out are stored on the user level in mongo
I’ll try to take a rack at this sometime this week.

The deja vu bot was something I'm really glad was able to be implemented
:f-it-ship-it:
Question about deja vu bot: when I get scrambled, does the original message or the scrambled message get committed to the log for deja vu to pick up on?
I also just realized one of my random Good Morning typed out messages could theoretically get deja vu'd and ping a bunch of people.
Pretty sure it doesn't commit what bots post so only the orignal message. (assuming it commits before running the delete program)
:perfect:
it would be a hell of a thing to see one of those large good morning posts become a deja vu
honestly, I'd probably exclude messages over a certain character limit
what's a Juiblex?
oh. that's an ugly mofo

I don't notice him
did anyone here watch Onward ?
<@UDC03KCGK> <@UDC4QL95G>

It currently saves pre-bot messages. It does not filter out pings, so in theory deja vu could ping everyone if it grabs one of Drew’s messages.

We could change it to strip out pings, or a character limit or something. we should just come up with what we want it to do and it should be easy enough to plug in.
I don't know that I even want it to change. This was purely a hypothetical about how it works

I think the pings from one of those coming back is amusing

inbreeding is a massive problem in the arab world
Though I suppose calling it a problem would depend on who you spoke to
There are statistically higher rates of certain genetic defects/disorders
This is why it's illegal to do most places
Yeah, it just isn't likely to turn out healthy kids. On top of the morality thing, but I don't know how to form the argument against it other than "It's weird, according to my Western Culture upbringing."
the only argument I have against it is the tendency to produce unhealthy kids
any sort of moral argument is basically saying "my culture is superior to yours"
Exactly
What is this from? It looked like real video footage until the cgi came in
no idea
there wasn't a source where I found it
To be fair, it was super common in Western culture, especially among the elites to avoid polluting the blood line. You know till their children we're all verifiably messed up
#Merope Gaunt
I know a 'person' who
a) only cleans their home once in  3 weeks with hired help
b) was soft-diagnosed with covid-19 (No actual test since they werent dying)
c) still got the hired help to come clean their place
:big_oof: 
<https://secretvienna.org/royal-inbreeding-and-the-habsburg-jaw/>
That seems like a really bad idea. 
Awkward also asshole
they told the help  they 'probably' had it and they are 'probably' recovered  and the help said 'someone in my home has a cold and im probably immune' so this person thinks its justified
Ow. So bad. Turns out you and spread it for a couple weeks after getting it. And it also looks like you can catch it after recovering, so naturally immunity is not as much of a thing as we’d hoped. 
Yup!
Great, so it is just the worst
(Not that you wouldn’t know this, your acquaintance should)
Ummmm, no naturally immunity this quick is terrifying
rigggggggggggght
If you want good news, look at New Zealand. They look to have it basically entirely until control now. And Italy is able to start loosening restrictions now. 
yeah but they SHOULDNT
I don’t think they are undoing social distancing. Italy was such extreme lockdown
im just skeptical because schengen has such open borders
ah, yeah, that is a major concern.
I had to look it up, looks like a much of Schengen countries closed their borders. Although I can’t speak to how effective those closures are. Maybe people just skirt the checkpoints.

Did you make any dumpling? 
Not yet, this weekend! 
I ordered samyang spicy noodles and I'm excited for that to arrive
That'll keep me entertained for two days
I’m made chicken soup and steak so far
mistakes were made
tried to do day 1 of insanity and realized just how out of shape I am
got 2/3 of the way through
one of you should make milk steak and let me know how bad it is
milksteak with jellybeans?
yessir
LOL!!!!
I can’t have dairy 
That looks terrible
its a joke from a tv show. not a real dish
Ooo thank god
I can’t never do insanity, I’m still injured and way out of shape
I mean, you said you had it on your computer already so yeah, go with what you have. 
But it is a way less beginner friendly program then base p90x
Though to be fair, even with that, it's normal to not be able to do all of the video and need to take lots of breaks
back in the day, I was able to do it

<https://giphy.com/gifs/wife-mess-toddler-8jt53DWrQbJMA|https://giphy.com/gifs/wife-mess-toddler-8jt53DWrQbJMA>
what happened?
So I got a new tool to run, and getting caught up on that. An L4 is leaving, so now I"m 50/50 on a new team, and we found out today that another L1 is leaving so my team has to lean in there too
It's minorly concerning
do you know them well enough to ask why theyre leaving?
It's B2B. It's not exactly a department I think of when I think high retention departments
Seems the L4 is leaving because he got moved to a new area with a poor hand off. (Working with Service, who we have next to no relationship with). The other one is back filling because marketing is understand.  Also don't forget this is the team that had the super confrontational All hands.
So the new Director seems to not be going over well with some people (he just seems like a normal corporate Director/VP to me)
:thisisfine2:
Funny because I do think it's fine, I've done well in worse
Ohh Aysh, I don't like meetings because nothing actually gets done in meetings

I agree
<https://vitals.lifehacker.com/why-time-no-longer-has-meaning-according-to-science-1842459302>
I disagree that it feels like longer than it has been
hm, right now bots have no idea about posting frequency. basically each post is totally independent. We could increment data in Mongo everytime we get an event in. <@UDC4QL95G> do you think this would work? At some point we’ll start running into CPU errors. Our Glitch server doesn’t really have a ton of power.
Just that I no longer have to care about what day of the week it is
Individual days feel longer, but weeks feel shorter
because there isnt anything happening to break up the motnotony
I fall asleep in meetings 
I don’t remember what day it is anymore. I don’t even get to check my calendar 
I could be mistaken, but I think we already hit mongo to load the user that posts the event. I think the CPU issue was more due to infinite spawning threads than it was actual performance restrictions
I could be mistaken, but I think we already hit mongo to load the user that posts the event. I think the CPU issue was more due to infinite spawning threads than it was actual performance restrictions
I would do it as the last thing the event does though, just to make sure bot responses are still fast as possible
Yeah, I don't find the Vitals article to be my experience at all. If anything a normal day feels shorter, and what was once two weeks was suddenly 6. I am constantly forgetting which day of the week it is and finding it difficult to keep track of that with the exception that there are lots of things I can only get done during normal business hours

I had a coworker who had a theory about this. Cause when you were a kid, days/weeks seemed longer. He thought it's cause every day as a kid is much more of a percentage of your life than as an adult

I also subscribe to the percentage of life theory

My mom called me this morning with a 'be careful, people are losing jobs everywhere' as if I can do something about it.
Very annoyed.
work harder aysh!
thats what she said, youre a full parent now Cj :cry:
well you could always go with the old classic of sleep yor way to the top
...............id rather not
ha suggested something your mother didnt I still got it!
If Ashley is crying all CJ have to do is hold her. She just cries when I hold her... I think we got the wrong kid

We totally got the right kids, she's awesome
I mean, we don't technically know they her mother DIDN'T suggest that too
If CJ holds her significantly more than you, is it possible she is more bound to CJ's touch than your's? Like a reverse "I want my mommy."
See I disagree, I think it has less to do with percentage of life, and more to do with novelty (which are correlated, but not the same)
I WILL FIND SOMETHING AND ALL OF YOU WILL REGET IT!

Comp intl tricks on reddit, WATCH OUT!
<@UDDE5960N> on its turn the tarrasque (this is no joke, straight from the book) makes 5 attacks: two with its claws, one with its horns, one with its tail, and then bites trying to swallow you.

assuming all hit, that’s 148 damage. You’re blinded and restrained and will take an additional 56 acid damage every round.
lol
All because I tried to throw him with my mind
saw this :smile:
honestly, amazon has defnitely suggested a product i bought on wayfair that was names differently so theyre scraping images
when WF did that dumb thing where they named products with employee names you could see the other websites copying the name pretty obviously.
That's a significant reason as to why there is a photo department, right?
So you at least have proprietary images that your site has that others don't for products
yeah but i suppose amazon engineers have brains
Also we sell so many things. Photo department can’t take custom photos of all of them. 
Wayfair spends a lot of money to do photo renderings, unique copy, etc to hide the origins of the products from people and other companies. Though the comp Intel team does scrap competitor websites and attempt to block other companies from scraping wayfair. Its typical business practice, I think it's funny how reddit is somewhat up in arms about it
There are a lot of normal things we should be up in arms about. 
because rich/ big coporations/ anyone that charges you = BAD
Reddit isn't up in arms, just some really annoyed Comp intel guys is telling the serfs how to be smarter
Or a serf found something they thought no one knew about
Also valid
Yeah, I’m on CompIntel and it’s literally my job to find matches to our competitors
Someone else is running an experiment on my team to see how long it takes Amazon to rematch our products when we change the SKU/obfuscate the imagery 
OH MAN THAT SOUNDS FUN!
Do you compare notes with how long it takes you guys to do the same thing?
sounds like teaching robots how to conduct espionage against each other. The Matrix is going to start with furniture sales.
Bold of you to assume it hasn't already started
Not yet anyway, it’s the first time we’ve run this kind of test. Well it’s algorithms but also a lot is manpower
What a way for the world to end, Amazon and Wayfair bots becoming sentient
"It wasn't the governments that did it, they didn't have a good public feedback for the bots.  No it was the multinational corporations, that built skynet constantly trying to out do each other on price.  Imagine that, human civilization undone by bots trying to price match"
fun fact: comp intel does not attempt to block other competitors from scraping wayfair
fun fact: comp intel does not attempt to block other competitors from scraping wayfair
Source: I work on CompIntel
There's a specific other team that attempts to manage bot traffic on wayfair sites
I can confirm we're a long way away from Wayfair bots being sentient
Huh, when I applied to comp Intel. About 4 years ago, I was told wayfair was doing that...
Wayfair does that, just not CompIntel
We have to deal with other companies trying to block us though
Wait, so do you and Brenden work on the same team now?
lol, this is nothing new
Phoebe predates me on CompIntel
hell, the was on the precursor of my original team
What team did you work on before you switched to engineering?
CompIntel
just not the engineering side
???
Yeah brenden and I joined FT on the same day
I actually didn't realize that :hmm:
So are you both engineering side? How big is this team?
Bad bot
No, phoebe isn't on the engineering side
How many people make up Comp Intel?
70?
idk
something like that
probably more if we count STX or whatever they're called
let me do an org browser count
So let me get this straight: they are trying to copy your listings and compare prices with the exact same photos and products. However, you are trying to scrape their sites, to compare the exact same thing.
So doesn't hiding it, actually make your own job harder?
59 people; from engineering/business/product
2 more in the EU
7 more if you include the data science matching team
STX is 5
Wow, ok then. I thought it was always this tiny team that you and a few other people were on
so I'll call the final number 66
excluding DS
Nah, we make Wayfair lots of money
just indirectly
By keeping products from being copied in price? Or by pricing products closer to other competitors?
Mainly by providing pricing of competitors as an input to Wayfair's pricing model
but in quite a few other ways
Wayfair bots are about as smart as prometheus is
Nah cause we also have all the original product data in our databases to leverage
I"M SO CONFUSED ABOUT HOW I"M ON THIS THREAD!!!

:thursday: 
so tired
no idea why; but I slept terribly last night
ive found i cannot sleep on my rihgt nay more without very sharp pain
i do not understand why
Oof
Ouchies
yeah- is this something you see chiropractors for?
Depends on where it's located
Depends? If it's your side it could be a rib issue which a chiropractor could help with, but ribs are also finicky and can't always do anything to fix the issue, just got to wait it out
its......... on my  upper arm and hip because it feels like im putting my body weight on them. as if ive forgotten fo to lay down? but i sleep the same way on my  left and it doesnt hurt.
its distributed, not as if something's broken
have you tried turning them off and on again?
i have actually, tried some rolling, an accidental somersault, memory foam topper
...accidental somersault?
do you sleep in a god damn yoga poze?
my physician families really resent when someone calls a chiropractor a 'doctor'
au contraire, i sleep like im dead and dont move
accidental somersault says otherwise
ALL GENIUSES WERE THOUGHT TO BE WEIRD
ok admittedly that wasnt when i was  trying to sleep. i usually do this forearm wall stand and ...uh.... did it without the wall on monday and did a flip
Huh
I would see a internal doctor first to make sure it’s not issues internally then a chiropractor 
I'm now convinced that aysh can defy gravity
don't worry, I have you covered; see above
:smile:
ummmm you guys worry me
it feels very external
wait till ashley starts doing flips in her crib
That would be weird
I couldn’t sleep on my right side either when I was pregnant
Do you want to see my chinese doctor?
she's going to start rolling in 2-3 months anyway
........im very certain i am not pregnant :disappointed:
I went to my doctor weekly for 3 weeks and they didn’t know that I was pregnant
She's already started
She's just bad at ti
it
She inches up her bassinet like a caterpillar 
Babies are notorious escape artists.
Is the singer bot new, or did i just forget it exists
She'll figure out how to get out the crib soon enough.
its old
Doubtful, she has to figure out how to sit up first
wow its like, singing as me
you think she cares for your sequence of events rules?
one step at a time, that's how any good prison break works
:slightly_smiling_face:
you have some _Wicked_ mood?
no Brenden was saying i can defy gravity
oh yeah, that's why I grabbed the song. :slightly_smiling_face: It would have showed up right after Brenden said it, but there was a bug in the bot I had to fix first.
Um, I don't think this is a matter of the doctor bungling it up and not noticing she's pregnant, Mei
The fact that you whipped this up just to show us on this slack made my day
I'm still laughing
I've never thought to try this with my forearms. I've just always seen people do this on their hands and I've never had the upper body strength in my arms to do that.
Til we have a flag emoji simply by using a country abbreviation
Wait, so this song was coming up naturally? Or you can get the bot to trigger specific songs on command?
I mean, who says she has to roll before she can somersault.
No one's giving her a tech tree she has to follow. She'll figure this basic motor skills thing out in whatever order she wants
AGree
100%
Fiyah
on point
5/7
perfect
I mean.... basic motor skills build on themselves.... so there's a tech tree right ther
but where is climbing trees on the tech tree?
you start at the bottom
well, its all easier if gravity is optional for you. :stuck_out_tongue:
H mart has online delivery of some stuff and i am BEYOND excited
I heard that delivery is so so 
I heard that delivery is so so 
Just saying it could happen. I have a awesome chiropractor in the Copley area if you want after this pandemic 
meaning? its late?
Do you have other recommendations? for delivery?
Yea I heard that they deliver late so it’s hard to get fresh stuff but other stuff is ok i thin
I sent my brother last time I was craving korean bbq lol
yeah i just want chili paste/ seaweed etc not fresh
Gotacha 
do you have seaweed recommendation?
Do you like individual ones or the big sheet ones? It depends on your taste of what flavors or how salty you like it
Do you like individual ones or the big sheet ones? It depends on your taste of what flavors or how salty you like it
seaweed is gross
Seaweed is yummy
Everybody else seems to love it, but I just can't stand the stuff
I feel that way about hummus. 
I have this ability to trick my brain and palette to, with enough exposure, like things I didn't initially like (eg hummus, seaweed, seltzer water, sushi)
Conversation in the other thread made me think of this. separate thread for conversation here.
This was an icebreaker question a friend of mine was telling me they had with a group of people a little while ago:

What is something that you don’t like that you are “supposed” to (it feels like everyone else likes it)?
like hummus would be one of mine.
like hummus would be one of mine.
<@UDC4QL95G> what kind of seaweed have you had? I like all kind of seaweed like the Japanese seaweed salad and fried seaweed hehehe
<@UDD45P5A9> you don’t like sushi? Is it because of the raw fish? 
Seltzer water
oh, me too. I really dislike sparkling water
soda/seltzer
dogs. I am really not a dog person.
Mei, I want to use it to chop and sprinkle on rice or add as big  to pieces soups. So i want the sheets.
I dont know what laver seaweed is, if you know what that tastes like?

Fauci says a vaccine by January is possible. For comparison, the mumps vaccine, generally considered the fastest vaccine to be created (from invention to deployment) took about 4 years.

<https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus-vaccine-january-doable-dr-anthony-fauci-says-t180358>
interesting
so lockdown till jan
interesting
sounds like there will be some room to open society up some over the summer, but the fall will require locking down again
<@UK7V13DS7> I like rolls now, but took some time, I haven't ventured to raw sushi yet, it's a bit the raw fish aspect, and a little not knowing what to start with
Lockdown till Jan if everything goes right
Lockdown till Jan if everything goes right
<@UDD45P5A9> SOUNDS LIKE SUSHI NIGHT TO ME!
I miss sushi. Haven’t had it in a while. It’s one thing I’m really not going to make at home. 
Yeah...but plague? So may have to wait a bit...
I mean sure
I mean sure
Or you could risk the plague and come to our house, Mei makes really good sushi
I don't have a car, so I'd have to risk public transit which is germ laden on a good day...
Nah. I'll wait
probably for the best
Dogs, Pie
lol
I'm also sure, per work, I'm not allowed to leave the state without authorization
WTF YOU DON'T LIKE DOGS!!?!?!?
I only like dogs with specific personalities/dispsitions
I'm in the same state as you, just really close to the line
I cannot stand barking
I thought you were in ri
Nope Attleboro MA
We're the first town in MA from RI (in a particular direction)
honestly, this is masterfully done: `<https://v.redd.it/pidabci54zv41>`
Ahh, well that would mean I wouldn't get in trouble for work...but still no car.
I quite like well trained dogs. I have never had a dog that was trained at all, so as a result, I have a general mis-trust of dogs
We'll do sushi once things are allowed to open up
<https://v.redd.it/pidabci54zv41>
first link was broken
Yeah. I’m allergic to them so wasn’t around them growing up. I just tend to not like having them around at all. 
agreed regarding pie
poorly trained dogs also piss me off
but that doesn't fit the question
as most people don't like poorly trained dogs
since they're a menace to society
here's my real controversial one: the beach
I’ll join on that one. 
Damn. I wonder how many times they had to redo the whole sequence to get it all in one clip
It fits because I don't like dogs in general, as in my eyes, a well trained dog is an exception
you've clearly had bad experiences with dogs
Yessir
most dogs I've met are fairly well trained
`fairly well trained` probably wouldn't fit the bill tbh
what acts by dogs annoy you?
Barking, Begging, aggression, pulling the leash, dogs that are afraid of literally everything
fairly well trained eliminates just about all of those
might still see some begging, and a bit of pulling on the leash, depending on how large the dog is
smaller dogs tend to pull more
I like cats. They are chill. Dogs aren't in my experience. And old dogs are just... meh. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I find cats to be sociopathic fluff balls of apathy
Depends a lot on the cat, but in the case of cats, I don't really care much if they are super friendly or not, but a cat that is feral or unpettable is a no go
sounds like you don't want a pet, you want a roommate
to me, the friendliness is a large part of the draw of having a pet
hence why I like dogs
Cats got a bad rep. My cats always ran to the door to meet people and get pet whenever people came in.
I have a scar on my face to this day from one of my two early childhood cats
oof. Yeah don't have any of those.
the other of the two was considerably more friendly
I'm also down for sushi night
Though I would be willing to brave public transit, I don't think it is in the spirit of all of this for me to come over
The Office (tv show)
all streaming services should allow changing play speeds
I always watched my online lectures at 2x speed. It was SO nice to trun a 90 min class into 45 minutes
ha at the 'knead' bit
PAELLA!
I probably wouldn’t use it for streaming, but it’s an amazing feature for YouTube. Speeding up board game explanations is so useful. 
I'd want it in ral life also- people speak too slow '
It’s amazing that having those lyrics written out totally makes you hear the new words.

That's called the McGurk Effect
Was walking to the grocery store, and saw a dude walking by shake the hand of another dude standing outside the store protesting or something. Couldn't help but cringe a bit... over a handshake... weird times we live in
On that same trip there is a Huge sign literally blocking the door that says "Dont come in if you don't have a mask". And the number of people inside without a mask, who cant have failed too see it, was astonishing.
The star market near me has one way stickers on all the aisles. Most people figured out how to deal with it, but it only takes a few dense people to make the system break down. 
I love all type of soda just not the seltzer water
cats are scary and I'm allergic
I'll admit, I am  one of those dense people. I didn't notice them for too long, and even when I did, I quickly forgot
One direction in a store is hard for me. I always forget something.
Something fun I just did. Searched my old wayfair email on <http://haveibeenpwnd.com|haveibeenpwnd.com>, and boy, more results than I thought
The star market Daka is talking about also has one way signs on the floor that both point opposite directions. So depending on which side of the aisle you went in on, you'd think everyone else walking the other way was an iggnorant moron. Apparently the store employees putting down the one way signs didn't line them up
Omg lol
Omg lol
Good morning y'all!!
Good Morning! Happy Friday!
Good Morning! Happy Friday!
It's May! How the frick is it May?
May Day // International Worker’s Day. 
......................5th month
......................5th month
Why?
because not traveling is less dangerous
because not traveling is less dangerous
True but where did travel come from?
Where does anything come from?
The floor signs alternate every other isle
so you are supposed to zigzag down the store, but who the hell actually wants to go to every isle in the store
Apparently there are worker strikes happening all day today
Specifically at major grocery stores and online shippers
amazon, instacart, whole foods are the ones I heard of
I know Daka, but head down toward the end of the store where dairy and paper goods are and you'll see that at one end of a single aisle, it'll say one way and point down the aisle. You'll get to the end of the aisle and the arrow is pointing right back at you. If you walk down a path at the start of the aisles, it'll alternate correctly. The other side just also alternates and doesn't match up.
We're ALL GONNA DIE!
Trader Joe's
yeah so, yesterday at work someone posted an (overpriced) item saying 'still in stock on amazon' and immediately someone sais 'dont cross the picket fence' . I posted something similar about frikkin dried cheese powder, got a similar response. Someone asked something about  BJ's delivery and i said 'its powered through instacart' and i got the same response.


First, I wasn't indicating everyone should order from Amazon/ instacart and do it today so they go against this strike.
Second, why are these things communicated as rules and not suggestions? As if theyre trying to shame someone into not making their own choices?

AnywAY- i WAS mildly annoyed
yeah, it rubbed me the wrong way as well
they should be informing you, not mandating you do something
America has been so anti-union, I think it’s just assumed they were all going to ignore or undermine the strike. So the people in favor of it start out really defensive. 
no this just came off as a holier than though finger wagging
*thou
lol
Oh, people like being holier than thou. It’s terrible. 
I had something delivered by Amazon this morning 
yea..... It was really funny too because someone pointed out that ordering during the strike is what you should do, because it makes more Customers angrier. Which is the whole point of the strike
oh tha's awful
never even noticed
It's not like you're a scab crossing the picket line to get people's job done
hahaha that makes sense :smile: order stuff, complain its late, take amazon's money for the delay compensation
They don't even know how to support strikes
Although, if those companies see their orders fall dramatically during a strike, that gives the strikers more power. 
No, it doesn't
The point of a strike from a workers perspective is, "You can't do this without all of us"
Sure it does. It shows the strike was wider support, public buy in, and real affect on the bottom line. 
Lower order volume makes it easier for scabs to keep things runnign
For a strike, you want to drive volume UP! and have things FAIL
People not buying things is a failure. 
......
We’re not giving the companies our money. 
Because the point is to shame
Like, what they are saying is "who are you to not support workers?"
Problem with online orders, is when things FAIL, you still gave the company your mone
yeah, which is annoying. they dont get to tell me how to think
It’s saying without treating workers well, society won’t allow Amazon to exist. 
and it is a lot of effort to get it back, most people will simply just chalk it up to the virus, and move on
Boycotts and Strikes cause companies to do things via different processes
Combining them makes them BOTH less effective
You don't boycott a company for a day, that's a sustained effort
Which decreases demand, and it's the public way of saying I don't like business practice
The issue is that a strike doesn't work for online purchases
Right, if the strikes last longer we should avoid shipping for longer. 
because if you strike for a day, nobody is gonna notice shit
SURE IT DOES!
Shit doesn't go out
but so much of the process is automated, and shit will still be going out
I disagree
because there's still someone in the loop for opening the door and showing the truck it's location
For making sure the automated process are going to the proper process
lol if i order today, thatll only happen tomorrow
Also lets be clear both, strikes and boycotts need to LAST
so if the strike in on May 1, PST 9AM-5PM, when should i stop ordering to make sure that its effective :smile:
Yeah, but the strike is not going to be 100% effective
a single day strike is not as effective as a week long strike
There will still be worker
Yes, Daka, they're called scabs
And the point is, MORE VOLUME causes more failures for the scabs which results in more complaints from customers
which makes the company more likely to fold to demands because of the worst customer experience
This is why boycotting and strikes don't work together
I'm also thinking that this is going to be a pretty weak strike
The people working the jobs that are striking are already likely living paycheck to paycheck. I'm betting a lot of them can't really afford to strike
I agree strikes and boycotts need to be sustained efforts, not just blips on the radar.
However, you're the first person I've ever seen suggest purchase more from a company with striking workers
I agree with aysh, order and complain
yeah that sounds like a good way to scam people.
"Hey nobody is working for amazon today, go spend your money on things you know will be delayed"
i was just adding to the chaos, but i dont think the strike really makes sense
Yeah, I spent most of my childhood hearing how unions were bad. It's a toxic culture we've created around them
YES DAKA THAT'S THE POINT
AND THEN BITCH ABOUT HOW YOUR SHIT IS DELAYED AND WHY WOULD I EVER SHOP WITH AMAZON AGAIN!!!
Why the hell would I, as the person spending the money, throw the money away...
I think they are trying to make you feel something, not think something
Why did people pay Verizon when Verizon was on strike
BECAUSE YOUR EXPECTING A GOOD!
but i know they are on strike... and i know not to expect the good...
na- youre ultimately going to get it, you just get a 10$ gift card from amazon as a 'gesture of goodwill'
like i said, i wasnt even indicating that i feel or think otherwise
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT AMAZON PROMISED YOU!
YOU THE CUSTOMER HAVE A PROMISE THAT AMAZON DIDN"T KEEP!
why are you yelling?
Because i'm annoyed
uhhh amazon has "Due to covid things are being delayed" plastered everywhere
there is no promise
Yeah, I mean, you think the system works that way, but this feels like someone trying to sell me trickle down economics: you can reach that conclusion and try to back it up on paper, but the reality is very different."
im not saying that i dont event now. Im saying its annoying when people force their beliefs on someone else
Then this is all pointless because Amazon has a successful monopoly and there's nothing you can do
I'm happy with Amazon's monopoly tbh
This is where Daka's amorality is annoying
retail monopoly is one thing. the AWS piece is what;s a lot more scary
If I try to go shopping, and I get blocked at the door by people striking, i'm not gonna turn my anger at the store. I'm gonna be pissed off at the workers.
Even Amazon’s retail monopoly is built on cruelty.
I think it is fair to be forecful with beliefs when someone having other beliefs results in harm to people.
Believe what you want, but the instant your beliefs infringe on my well being or that of someone else, you're gonna hear about it.
Letting someone "have their beliefs" has led to all sorts of trouble: see Charlotesville
again- thats where it should be phrased as a suggestion.
not sure if this is a question in my morality, as I was not aware that amazon's practices, other than working conditions, were bad.
you've just justified all the anti-vax people being annoying
Vegans do this and they're an instant meme
You dont' convince people to join your side by shaming them, you make them more likely to cement their views
Also, it's not an all encompassing monopoly. We've stopped ordering stuff from Amazon. Makes life slightly harder, but it isn't too difficult to find other online retailers for the products we need
guys I think we've fallen back on old habits; this is another thread where everyone disagrees with drew
arent there anti-trust laws in the US that could be used to break it up if it actually becomes a monopoly?
The real problem is there is a MASSIVE workforce that are willing to work under horrible conditions, so why would people not advantage of them.
Most people don't work towards "the greater good"
No, but this whole pandemic is starting to shift people's perspective in terms of what work and what pay they are willing to put up with
I think that is just a vocal minority
Its not really an either or, you have to do both. When people don’t know, you guide them in gently. But at some point line must be drawn. Talking to random coworkers, you shouldn’t start out so hostile. Assume they don’t know and state your positions. If you’re a state government, then yeah, make vaccines mandatory.
Like people hear I'm unemployed, and trust me until those checks get set up it fucking sucks, however, once you do cut through the bullshit, I am WAY better off than people who are deemed essential right now
in theory. They haven’t . been enforced since before Regan.
I think the best way i've heard it, is they're not essential, they're expendable
/roll 1d20+1
That’s why you’ve seen the number of companies in most fields drop, and the ones left getting huge.
America is starting to sound very socialist all of a sudden
do you have a reference to the Regan era enforcement?
*for
I mean Reagan was the one who stopped enforcing them.
That is assuming they were ever anything other than expendible though
Ehhhhhhhh, it's always sounded socialist expect for modern history
Look at FDR and the new deal
ah - ok but when was the last time this happened?
hOw DaRe YoU cAlL tHiS gReAt CoUnTrY cOmMuNiSt
(Dont know all this history)
Yeah, I mean a lot of what today's world looks like is shaped by the 80's
I don’t know about last time, but the most famous example is the breakup of Edison Bell
that must have been a bitch to type out
I learned of this disdain for communism from Seinfeld
yes
yes it was
(AT&amp;T)
I appreciate it

Technically it happened during the Reagan administration, but the wheels really started rolling under Nixon
I never understood distain for various forms of government.
Weirdly, the reason America has Labor Day was that it was trying to disconnect itself from International Worker’s Day. Everyone else striking in May, but American’s think about unions in September.
I've heard that.
<@UETS9HTSS> I'm just having to fill in for <@UDBGH9BMX> who used to take the brunt of 1 man arguments
Behind the Bastards (podcast) just did a great two parter on The Battle of Blair Mountain, a huge coal miners strike. The company pulled out machine guns and even dropped bombs from airplanes on the workers.

worth a listen to today.
Honestly, because most of it is manufactured. I'm not saying straight communism will ever be successful, but it was mostly done as propoganda in the first place
Manufactured is a good word for it. Never took the time to sort through that is and isn't just propaganda.
I just skimmed so I think that this has been brought up, but the problem with boycotting Amazon and all that is that that's all we have right now. Gotta use instacart or Amazon because it's available, AND it's so much cheaper and easier. I don't think we can really blame consumers, especially because they problem (bad work conditions, low pay, etc) is encouraged by the system and is the product of a "pure" capitalist system. 

That's why we need govt intervention. They're the only ones who can really force Amazon to be nicer, to distribute the wealth a bit more evenly, etc. Sure, consumers "could", but that's a sustained campaign with a majority of people buying in to something that will hurt them in a time that's already very difficult for most
(thanks Drew for the ping so I saw this)
There's also the disconnect between people purchasing online and the people working to make that possible. From a consumer standpoint, they click a few buttons, and the package arrives at there door. There is literally no thought about any of the steps between.
From your point of view, yes. From the viewpoint of the type of person in #nonwork-activism, probably not.
Glad it was helpful instead of annoying
Yea for most anti-trust you want to go back to Teddy Roosevelt's time and the "Muck Rakers"
They weren't it's just more obvious now.
How would the activism people feel about using the Wayfair offices to house homeless people temporarily?
(Im not implying anything. I just read something about hotels in NY doing that since their rooms are empty anyway and was curious)
Logistically it probably makes more sense for WF to donate money to a hotel to defray the cost. WF would probably have to bring in staff to keep things secure. Hotels naturally give people some protection since they have separate rooms. They also don’t have computers lying around which could be stolen. WF would also have to buy mattresses or sleeping bags or something.

Hotels letting in the homeless is great. Or there have been a couple places where the government opened up empty houses that had been on the market for a while and said someone should be able to sleep here.
Yea, agree with Doug here - warehouses are not made for people to live in
oh, I was thinking about our office space.
I've always questioned Wayfair donating money though... They have no money and don't make money, so what are they donating?
what happens if companies in general just don’t go back to offices?
what do we as a society do with buildings with empty floors?
Oh, offices. The same thing I said for warehouses also apply to offices
if we don’t go back to using the office, it could be turned into something livable.
Maybe we only end up going into the office for jobs that absolutely require it, and have a bunch of meeting rooms. WF wouldn’t need nearly the space it currently had.
Im not really thinking about the practicalities of it, more about the perception
oh, my bad.
Dave we have LOTS of money
It's all investor and debtor money
yes, but since we're not making a profit, we shouldn't use it towards humanitarian efforts
theyre just shifting op-ex right? they already have charitable contribution programs
by that logic, snacks and pod outings are frivolous and maybe not spending there will help us get closer to profits?
that's oversimplified
you need to spend money like that to retain talent
lol yeah it totally is, that was the point
I'm confused by the way you've framed the question. "How would the activism people feel...?"
It feels rhetorical
drew, was that in the wrong thread?
You really think pod outings and snacks will retain talent? I left for a company that didn't have those, and I don't miss them because what keeps me going at my new company is feeling valued in a multitude of ways
alone, no, but perks help
No, look at the top message of this thread. I quoted it
ahh, I missed that
trying to speculate on whether they would support  it .
I'm regretting going to sleep at 4am
Considering taking a lunch nap
i did the same!  but no naps for me
I’ve done that a couple times before weekends, I’ve managed to avoid doing it when I’m going to have to work in the morning. Just normal 2am those nights. :p
yeah, I'm fine with 2-3am, but 4am just feels so different
Hmmm I  think it depends on where. If for example the proposal was to clear out a floor for homeless to live in, then probably. IF it was to live in the office as it currently stands, No.
Hell, if they like clear all the desks out of the 4th floor of copley to act as a shelter, I got no issues with it
I'd be pissed if they messed with the stuff I have at my desk
but so long as I got it all back in the same condition, I'd be okay with it
The idea of a homeless dude sitting in my chair doens't sit well with me. I'd prefer all my stuff be moved elsewhere if they are going to occupy where my desk is.
I'd also want my stuff put in storage or something
between 2 and 3, if I see a clock, i'll just go to bed. If I see any time past 3, i usually regret it.
was listening to an audiobook and decided to finish it
I feel like the old man going to sleep at 9pm
Also Jesus Christ our department is dropping like flies. I'm aware of 6 people leaving since I joined
3 in the last 2 weeks
speak with them if ypu can
I probably will, but this is cray cray
I'm with Doug though that it isn't really practical and that Wayfair doesn't have the internal infrastructure to do that without partnering with an emergency relief org that is trained in this. Supporting hotels to do it is just a better way to do it.
Leaving voluntarily during this time seems nuts. You can't go on unemployment for leaving voluntarily, and trying to take a new job is difficult if you don't have something lined up. Worst of all, even if you get the job, onboarding remotely will just go badly. It just won't get you off to a good start.
Just switching teams at Wayfair there were a dozen access and equipment issues. Now double that with you are at home and don't have the necessary contacts to get it resolved because you're using your own equipment? 
Good. Fucking. Luck.
Pretty much everywhere considered "essintial" is hiring, so it's not hard to find _something_ to get at least some money coming in. Especially grocery stores

no idea
looks like no
Ah, I installed new version of python, which wiped my libraries
I think it hasn’t run since the 27th
if you run it now, will it only pick up todays emotes? Or will it go back to the last time it was run?
I'll configure it to pick up everything since the 27th

Hotels are better to be used as homeless shelters than building since the infrastructure is not there
you look very prepared.
Bank Robbing time
did you undergrad in India?
yes , i did
is it common for colleges there to have dress codes?
OMG kinda, but mine was infamous for it
Boys had to be clean shaven, wear a shirt and tie and formal pants.
Girls had to wear indian clothes with sleeves and the scarf thing had to hide le boobies.

Professors had to do the same PLUS wear this lab coat kinda thing over that
<https://www.wwlp.com/news/health/coronavirus-local-impact/coronavirus-in-massachusetts-governor-baker-update-on-covid-19-response-may-1/>
oof
I probably wouldn’t go to school if it meant wearing a tie. Ties suck.
I had to stay clean shaven in high school for dress code. The vice principal had to warn me about it all the time because I would forget to shave for a week.
MBA had us wear business casual for school
you should say your business is a bakery and come in a flour dusted apron
the average temperature was also about 90 F
Wearing formal pants in 90 degree heat would have killed me. 
I prefer cold weather. I don’t do well with high heat. 
yeah the students weren't happy about it
BUT
we got to wear like jeans and stuff and boys could wear collared tshirts on SATURDAYS
Did you go to class on Saturdays?
YES.
That, that sounds horrible...I don't think I'll be going to school in india any time soon
no no my school was 'special'

All about this. Signed up for a mailing. Will happily volunteer too
Why don't those apostrophes make me feel better?
my school catered to helicopter parents who wouldnt let their kids have sleepovers.

It got pushed to May 18 to reopen non essential businesses. I won’t be shocked if it gets pushed again. 
Ok, good to know.
It just hit me today how this whole thing has gone one for the entire month of April. Like I know it started in mid March, but it didn't hit until today "Oh, I spent an ENTIRE month of the year indoors for 98% of it"
At least April isn't the greatest month to be outside in New England
coldest april ever in boston ,apaprently
Really, I knew it was nasty out
Huh
Interesting 
It been raining a lot
I’m happy my parents never knew about this school
i definitely misspoke <https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/30/metro/boston-sees-lowest-high-temperature-april-record/>

how lovely
Good morning :wave:

Good morning!
Good morning :slightly_smiling_face:
Man, Being in an empty airport in the middle of the day is so disconcerting
Man, Being in an empty airport in the middle of the day is so disconcerting
ALSO THE ASSIGNED ME A MIDDLE SEAT. WTF
what calls for the travels Daka?
Yea
That sounds terrifying right now
Where are you going?
If the plane isn't full, just move ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Still hilarious
Honestly, is flying on a near empty plane any more terrifying than going to the grocery store?
There's a lot of stories of packed planes actually...interesting to see if Daka's plane is empty or full
though only packed planes would make the news
so it's probably still rare
Looking around the plane, plenty of empty seats. Looks like they just wanted to get me infected
Dad had a heart attack and is was the ICU. He's ok now.
plane has maybe one person per 3 seats.
Dude on the plane next to me, no mas,. Coughing of course, sees my face covering and is like "you know that does nothing right".
It does nothing for yourself. You do it for other people, coughing guy. 
He's also been traveling a lot since flights are so cheap. I'm screwed
This is why we need a government to step in. 
A couple of the airlines are requiring masks now. 
ask the attendant to let you move
:this:
Good bot
Seriously, move
Like this is a totally normal thing to do on near empty flights. Go find an empty row
Uff! Take care!
Omg good luck!! 
You should be able to change seat at the kiosk or on your phone app
Glad he's doing ok now!
I mean... Mei and I kicked a person out of our seat on an international flight
well, yeah, it was your seat
If there's an empty seat, nobody cares but the person who might be sitting there
what does that have to do with this?
I'm more with the fuck asking, just move yourself
They may ask where you moved from, but typically don't care
unless you give yourself an upgrade
like extra legroom seats or first class
then they care
Oh man, I've yet to see the flight attendant that gives a shit unless you go to an upgraded section or somebody actually has that seat you just took
Oh yeah I moved already.
Yeah I moved already, but we were a couple of the first people on the plane, so we had to wait till the flow of people stopped
Good, thankful to hear you made a move
Alright, real question though <@UDC4QL95G>: what is the trip for?
Thread above. His Dad is in poor health.
Chaos seed has failed me
thread isn’t long enough yet.
Oh man, glad he's ok now!
It hit the minimum
Just waiting for Chaos seed to troll me in 3...2...1...
lol
Is it working today though?
Ok it worked, it trolled me
Testing
lol
I just moved and pretend that I was suppose to sit there. Then no one will ask questions hehehehe I snatch 3 or 4 seats to myself sometimes
well, that is memorable
well, that is memorable
Should i sell stock on thursday?
???
<#C0100JYKBME|stock-thoughts>
no that channel is too smart and intimidates me
ah. fair.
W is back to $130, pretty good.
I mean, also not trying to chase you out of the channel. just a reminder the channel existed. you’re good, don’t listen to me.
It's the same people as this channel!?!?!
I'd say don't sell, most analysts think well make up some of the loss (of the stock market in general)by summer, and should make up all loss in 2 years or so. So I  general it's best to hold on for a bit.
I'm with Doug, your response just confuses me
Wait... when is our earnings call?
earnings is tomorrow
tomorrow
Window opens on Thursday
I NEVER LISTEN TO YOU
? CJ I said the opposite. her response does not confuse me.
he;s with you on 'there's a channel for this'
I've found for wayfair, unless you need the cash for something, it's better to hold onto stock, and if you leave wayfair to cash out at a better price
do you HAVE to cahc out if/ when you leave?
*cash
no, you shouldn’t have to sell stock when you leave.
you just lose whatever hasn’t vested yet.
Kinda? Your portfolio is changed, so it's no longer wayfair managed, and can affect the number of shares you have. I decided to cash out as I didn't want to have multiple portfolios open
And I agree with doug, it's less likely to get lost than in here
Yes, but I don't understand what you not listening to me, has to do with the fact that it's the same people in both channels!
NO SHIT! I had no idea, I hate how little announcement we get
You can also transfer your stocks to a personally maintained portfolio to Victoria's point.
I wasn't allowed to transfer to my own portfolio, I had to sell mine and transfer the cash into my own portfolio, which then got invested into other stocks. Even though both portfolios were Merrill lynch (or Merrill edge for the wayfair one)
Seriously?
Yup
I think you got a shady SOB because <https://www.finra.org/investors/transferring-brokerage-account>
I didn't really care because I would have sold them anyways
That's also valid, but I just want to make sure people know they have the ability, and they should push back against lazy people
I agree, just sharing my experience
to circle back around to the original comment, selling while the stock is rising probably leads to a feel bad. I agree with Victoria, if you don’t need the cash right now, I’d probably hold off.
I would probably say depends on your risk tolerance. Like if Wayfair stock being at 30$ made you really nervous, you should probably liquidate some of your position. (You'll get most of the upside). If you didn't even realize Wayfair stock was that low. You should keep the stock
it made me nervous but more like 'uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i need to keep job god pls'
its like attending a fancy shmancy party where I have to dress up , vs board games pajama party - but with the same people?
So I think the last time I went about trying to learn Python on my own, the book I was using (online) forgot to mention downloading an IDE
So I think the last time I went about trying to learn Python on my own, the book I was using (online) forgot to mention downloading an IDE
Which my online java book did make sure we used
Maybe they want you to learn on a no dev, only prod, no spell check or anything live glitch server. :slightly_smiling_face:
I'm going through a 6 hour Youtube video first. Then taking a look at the book I shelved before and seeing if it is easier to go through once I know to do the exercises and such with an IDE
You never got the video call did you?
We did one for Daka
god I love that bot
say that shit out loud
Personally
I don't think I can without a bad scottish or irish accent
I lean towards Juypter Notebooks
same
it's great
I'd install that. I can help you do it if you want
Any way, point being, that channel was actually set up to be there for people like you Aysh to be able to ask questions about this stuff and for people to talk and speculate
So if it is intimidating, it is failing at that
but we did a video call for Dakota when he first started asking about it, and I don't know if you ever got a chance to circle back with any of us on the intro stuff
Just got confirmation that I get a significant raise in the summer review cycle :pizza-party-transparent:
I agree with Drew, people asked questions and I wanted to make sure you could find it later.  It's not meant to be full of Fancy people, more just people drinking a beer without the bots to confuse stuff
Cause Finance is already confusing enough
My take has generally been that learning languages isn’t really the best way in. I think the trick is learn one language. So if you have some java then make sure you’re comfortable with it. That’s not to lock you into a single language. Its that the things that are common among languages tend to be more important than the things that are different. Once you know “programming” in really whatever language, then to switch over languages you don’t really need that much instruction. “How do a define a class” “How do a call a function” “How do I find the length of a string”, those will end up being the kinds of questions you’ll have, which are all easily googled. and IDE will help a lot there, since it will automatically tell you when you’re using the right syntax so you know when to google things.

I’ve worked professionally with PHP, Python, Java, C# (very little), ES, React. Maybe some other things I’m forgetting right now and haven’t trained in any of them. or really studied beyond copying other people’s code or knowing the right questions to look at online.

So if you want to get into Python, great. but just remember that unlike real human languages, programming languages are not really that different. Just focus on understanding programming in one language and you’ll secretly be getting better at all languages.
Then you should be fine to leave it in like doug said
I agree with doug. I would also argue that programming is one of the few things that watching someone else do it, tends not to make you much better at it.
Yeah we've talked before about this quite a bit. I'm learning Python at this point precisely because the bots are all written in Python, so it gives me a good set of small projects to play around with as I get ideas.
Was learning Java back when I was in my first year at Wayfair because that was advice I got from Bret as a place to start and someone who had gotten into labs.
and didn't get very far with Java.
and I don't think trying to get any more in depth with VBA is the right move since that's such a limited use case of a language
and the video isn't just watch someone program for 6 hours, it's basically framed as a video course with exercises and such.
VBA is nice if you want to make Office dance. But yea it's not something I'd learn outside of a corporate enviroment
Also the amount of hidden bugs in that thing is astounding
Right, so I'm not trying to dig into that one any deeper until it comes up again for a job
actually I think playing with the bots is great training. You can connect glitch to VSCode if you want an IDE.
In general, overcoming problems to make something you actually care about is so much better at teaching than random example. plus, if you break the bots there is an <#C012AAM0FNZ|alerts> channel.  and we don’t really care too much.
come up with a bot idea and I’m sure we can get you to a point where it works. That translate bot surfaced several problems I didn’t know could happen until I tried it.
That's the plan. I've not had a shortage of bot ideas in the past, this just means I'm not depending on Daka or you to make them for me. And I care about the slack, so I end up having ideas for these kinds of things more than just trying to practice by sitting here thinking "I guess I could organize files"
I’m just realizing that sliding my work laptop around is scratching my kitchen table to shit.
I think making a bot work now, requires a little too much back knowledge. Like what the JSON looks like, what have we abstracted
We don't have really good documentation anywhere.....
How’d you find out so early?
I’d saying making a bot is a way of making a learning plan. It turns into a series of questions. How do a get this info? How to a do this to it? How do I return it?
I forget, but is it a wood table?
yeah
Ok, and was it on the pricier side or cheaper side?
probably pricer? It weighs a million billion pounds (I’m still scarred by how hard it was to get assembled and in place, just because of the weight)
my personal laptop doesn’t do it, but these newer mac was this dumb channel on the bottom
That's good then. Means it's solid wood and probably not a laminate. So you can buy some sandpaper, sand down the top lightly, just to remove the varnish, and then put on a new finish. Won't even know it was ever scratched
the lazy option is to rub a walnut on the scratches
(also better to try that before breaking out the sandpaper)
the current abstraction is really designed . around having an IDE. Once you get autocomplete, then it flows so smoothly.
I've never heard of this walnut trick. And I made furniture for 4 years
see if you're okay with how it looks after walnuts
if not, go for sandpaper
I was able to transfer my brockerage account. Just got around to it during quarantine and none of my shares had been touched due to any maintenance fees or crap like that
1. rub walnut vigorously over scratches
2. let sit for a bit
3. buff with microfiber cloth
you made furniture for 4 years?
did you spend like 15 years in your 20s?
I mean there's wood putty too, you could probably use that and very few people would notice
High school shop class. 1st year was half wood, half metal, but by year 2, it was just pick your own projects and go. I made my parent's coffee table, a double door book shelf for my dad, a podium, and a bunch of small boxes mostly because 4 different women in my family all wanted their own custom recipie boxes.
There were a couple andorondack chairs too, but we never refinished them so they ended up just rotting over time. They were built out of cheap pine so not exactly a big loss there.
And wood putty wouldn't really work unless these scratches are deep gouges. I'd be surprised if Doug has done more than scratch up the finish
well, I’m going to thrown down a placemat for now, stop the damage. Good to know there is a real solution when I get around to it.
I wish I had a chance to learn woodworking in high school
I'd have been all over that
It was basically my art class for 4 years.
My art was cello.
I'm using pycharm because that was recommended by the video and I wanted to just easily follow along. Does it have to be VSCode, or can I hook up any IDE to the glitch server?
Also an IDE? What about it do you like?
don’t know.
I don't have a picture of the book cabinet. I'll need to do that along with some of the other stuff there when I get a chance.
I aspire to retire into woodworking as a hobby
I only see VSCode on the glitch website.
I would also love to know if glitch has pycharm support
as I use that at work
But yeah, this is where buying higher end furniture instead of Ikea makes sense: repairs are possible in a way that you have no way of doing with cheaper stuff because they aren't hardwood.
It does have git connection. you should be able to clone the repo to your local, develop on your machine, and push code when you’re ready. I haven’t tried it out myself yet.
that'll work once we enforce source control
It's a lot of fun. I just don't have a car or garage, so I can't really pursue that without moving near Aeronaut brewery
My Art class in HS was CAD which was SOOO MUCH FUN!
yea if you think it's just finish damage, a fine grain sand paper and refinish would be the way to go
Drew you'd be so jealous, one of the guys on my softball team, his husband has a full wood working shop in the basement. it was fancy
My Dad’s an engineer (lie an actual one). CAD was a huge part of his job (before he transitioned more to managing other engineers)
very useful skill to have
Honestly, I'd settle for just having your basement. Could bring over some stuff I have back in Oregon and buy some other equipment over time.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
Talking to my managers
This isn't exactly a surprise for me, but I confirmed it given we were discussing the performance review implications of WFH
When I got hired into my current team, I was told I was put at the low end of the pay band, and there would be a correction during this review cycle
I had some skills to learn when I joined
wow nice
Yea!!!
I’m so not getting a raise this year... -__- kid destroy my performance rate
Beautiful table
You can use our basement :)
Ah I haven’t been able to get anything out of Tyler/Andrew. I was told that my pay band would change when I moved in to product but they never told me what the pay band was or where I fall in it. When I asked if they had checked to confirm even if my salary fell in the band or not, they just gave me some hand-wavy excuse that pay is only modified in the summer
I want to do wood work but I’m afraid of hurting myself
When I entered my current role, I was given an offer kind of like it was a new job
STOP DELETING THE CHAOS SEED I GET SO CONFUSED!!!
I thought you wanted our basement as a space
you would
Lol I literally wasn’t even told what my job would be outside of vaguely ops, I had to figure it out myself. I think I’m gonna ask a question about it in the “demystifying compensation” presentation
Lol I literally wasn’t even told what my job would be outside of vaguely ops, I had to figure it out myself. I think I’m gonna ask a question about it in the “demystifying compensation” presentation
What kind of question? That's a very large audience
What communication we should expect around compensation when switching roles/teams or who the POC should be when we do have questions
So something that is definitely not uncommon  for people at Wayfair to go through.
The easy answer there is your manager (on the new team), but that oddly doesn't seem to be the case here
Yes but Tyler has been pretty transparent about having next to no input on my compensation, he just gets it from _somewhere._ 
HR BP is the next stop, your dept should have a HR rep talk to them
It runs in code blocks. so I can make changes and re-run it as many times as I want without having to re-run the whole thing.
If you set up each cell right, it makes test and learn super easy within a single file
That does sound nice. Might look into it after I get through the video
There is a draw back, which is that if you make lots of changes to lots of Cells you can have X=6 as code, but in the data X=4 and you have no way to know other than to remember that's what you had it set as before
business partner
I've found it is important to talk about salary with people. It's both helped me find out when I was underpaid, and helped coworkers discover that they were underpaid
Yeah I had fairly good perspective of where my comp was while I was on analytics, but I have no idea where is on product. 
Actually Brenden you’ll probably get a kick out of this; 2 weeks after Arie started on CI we had a quarterly party bar crawl and he ended up just asking everyone about their salaries so that’s how I know. But I also know that the starting salary on the analytics side of CI has gone down since I started
He did the same thing at the first quarterly party I attended at the seaport world trade center up top on the mezzanine or whatever it's called
that's how I found out I was making less than him, but had more stock and got a sign on bonus
have you seen #nonwork-compensation?
Yeah I’ve browsed through it but it’s almost entirely engineering.

I found out in our conversation I had the same starting salary as someone on the team who joined with two years of experience (I was told at signing that mine was higher than the typical campus starting salary because of my co-op). I also got a starting bonus and some shares
I'd be curious to swap compensation info for your time on CompIntel if you're comfortable with that
Yeah I’ll pm you
fun fact, I haven't trimmed my beard since I started quarantining myself
fun fact, I haven't trimmed my beard since I started quarantining myself
and don't plan to until this ends
I'm seeing how long I can get it
I tried that. My mustache quickly becomes annoying and nice I starting shaving that I gave up on the beard. 
oh I trim my mustache so it doesn't go over my lip
and shave the edges
but I let the rest get some length
Ah, see the mustache is what tripped me up when I was letting it grow out. That and Sam wasn't as much of a fan of it as it got longer
Mei isn't a fan of any of it. It's too wiry for her
Haha alright I shall direct my questions appropriately! Thank you :blush:
Haha alright I shall direct my questions appropriately! Thank you :blush:
Good Morning!
Good morning! 1 hour long meeting done and another about to start!
Damn son, that's a brutal start to the morning
I'm being a little overdramatic with the gif, it's not that bad and I do have iced coffee, so things could be worse
Still 2 hours of meetings before 10 is not fun
Yeah, the first was was more listen than participate, so not that bad
I used to have meetings from 9am -5pm and I would work from 7am-9am, and 5pm-7pm for one of my old project
so Ive been working all week to make a PIP for someone.
Thee had been doing not so great and I had communicated that to.  Had even worked on a soft development plan for 8 weeks before this.
So yesterday told them we are working on this PIP.
Boom, he took the day off and resigned today.
Not shocking
Unexpected but not shocking
PIP = worst case, 6 weeks of pay and benefits. and getting fired = unemployment. he could have taken that instead.
Less lying about why you left your last job
Than I couldn't hack it
no, 1 day
so principled that someone couldnt say 'yeah, the company was trying to hit a head count and i had just moved teams so they let me go'?
did they give 2 weeks, or just leave?
Ohhh I mean don't get me wrong, that would totally black list the person in my world
People are dumb and ragy aysh
She's going to put me on a PIP well fuck you
Yeah I'm just surprised at the impracticality
Maybe if I were a millionaire I would have done that? Maybe?
are other software companies even hiring right now? I now the job markat was pretty good before the pandemic hit, but then a pandemic hit.
million bucks buys a lot of “fuck you”s
I've heard it isn't terrible
so it goes.
It's just that this isn't flipping me off at all. In fact it's less work for me , more loss for him so I just do not get it. Ah well
dumb people don't get that aysh
so it goes.
but now it's not on his... *PERMANENT RECORD*
leaving without a two week notice should be. if only
_cue monty python music from the rabbit scene_
<https://youtu.be/tgj3nZWtOfA?t=102>
I've heard it isn't terrible
I worked with someone who came in one day and quit because she wasn't respected and didn't feel like the team or managers deserved 2 weeks notice
lol
I knew the night before, the team found out via an email popup on one of the managers computers she was sharing during a standup...
that is a way to instantly lose all my respect
I do not disagree
We are saying these people are morons
I do not disagree
that is a way to instantly lose all my respect
hey said they disagree with the criticism of their work
Yes, and they're burning bridges they don't need to, you never know when you might need the company/a teammate later on
What would blacklist them for you? The no notice bit or being put on a PIP?
no notice
So unemployment is weird. You can't take it for quitting a job, but you can't always take it for being fired either. It's generally there for layoffs and being fired in the first 90 days
Actually a quick Google shows they would have qualified for unemployment because it wasn't willful misconduct
the latter
the former was an accident
Because of the manager sharing their email? Or quitting with no notice?
I don't know that I do understand correctly with that. Was the person who quit sharing a managers computer? Or was the manager sharing her own computer and the pop up came up?
like she was presenting at a meeting
the latter
So, I have a lot of thoughts on this topic given my employment history. 
Why someone quits rather than gets fired usually comes down to the narrative. Getting fired makes for some incredibly awkward interviews in the future, and also leaves you in the unknown about how that gets communicated when new companies go back to your old company for references. I'm not in HR, so I actually don't know if former companies communicate that you were fired? It's shared by a lot of people you're better off quitting than getting fired, whether or not that is actually true, and certainly in the face of financial sense.
Other reasons to quit are mental health related. PIPs are just going to draw out something already very painful to drag yourself through day by day.
Now, quitting without notice? Hadn't seen it till I got to the restaurant industry. Now I only ever see people quitting on the spot or getting fired. Usually a respect thing. In general, quitting on the spot doesn't hurt your boss very much at all. As the guy who is left holding down the bar afterwards...yeah, quitting on the spot really just fucks over your coworker and does not leave them in a situation where they look back fondly on you.
you can be fired after giving your two weeks. If your goal is just don’t be fired, then I guess leaving immediately is the only way to guarantee that.
hmm so Wayfair does not share anything other than employment dates. And they had the option of just taking 6 weeks pay and benefits without working on the PIP.
So in other words it was a severance offer?
"the team found out via an email popup on one of the managers computers she was sharing during a standup"
So if Wayfair really just does share employment dates, then yeah, just taking the severance is the way to go. Again, that isn't common knowledge
yes- we just hadnt given it yet because  i had to get it reviewed by 3 million people + HR
its pretty open info- they could have just asked
Yes, and is she the manager or the person who quit? That was what wasn't clear from the quote
<@UDD45P5A9> can you confirm?
Most companies don't do anything beyond confirm employment because otherwise they become liable

It's a galley
its pretty open info- they could have just asked
Yes, and is she the manager or the person who quit? That was what wasn't clear from the quote
oh nvm, it requires some repairs :sigh:
We were in a standup with a manager sharing her screen in a collab space, an email from a senior manager came through with "X just quit" as the subject. Everyone saw...
Can confirm what Brenden said
Most, but not all. Asking while employed is incredibly difficult to do. "Hey, say you fire me, what will you say?"
Just went through and googled a few things, and most sites advise on quitting over getting fired unless you really need the severance or unemployment. 
Mostly because you frame the narrative during interviews. If it ever comes up you lied during the interview, you can be fired from the new job on the spot because they write verification clauses into your contract.
The Hollow?
D&amp;D PBP server on discord
damn; 600 gp of repairs
I was trying to figure that out, LOL! That's expensive
I was debating on redoing my character in that. I think the shadow monk was a poor decision. We only got like 15xp and 100gp
yes to all the things drew said
My team just started a new project. I reserved a big chunk for me to work on. After a little digger I found out another team is planning to deploy a solution to my problem tomorrow. So my ticket done with zero effort. :slightly_smiling_face:

what flavor of barb?
There's a second one?
Dunno
I mostly just wanna recklessly attack and rage

Zealot: good flavor, rage beyond death
Ancestral guardian: support allies while smashing
Maybe need to go read, I'm still thinking 2 weapon fighting
GWM is stronger, but TWF is flavorful
also your crits hurt more with GWM
Also, cleave
True, I feel like TWF would have higher DPS
definitely not

yep

just level 4 and 8
you'll want to bump your str score as well
as much as it's a terrible class, battlerager seems to fit you
wear spiked armor and hug people to death
LOL!
That's why i was thinking TWF, no ASI I can't remember if you sack accuracy or dmg
But you get rage dmg, and you can use ASI for Str and Con
go mountain dwarf, and trolololol
you do seem to love TWF
yeah that sounds like a perfect excuse for a nap
easy bonus action economy usage, and decent DPS
rage takes a bonus action on turn 1; GWM has a bonus action use upon kills
some barbarian subclasses have BA uses
True, great for little mobs
Like I said have to check
Have a meeting in 30 mins
Perfect amount of time for a power nap
IMO [4d6 + 2STR + 2Rage + 20] &gt; [3d8 + 3STR + 3Rage]
<@UDDE5960N> are you Carric?
<@UDDE5960N> are you Carric?
yes you are
we're now in the same groupo
this'll be interesting
I'm more than double your level
Time to power-level I suppose
better hurry up with that character reshuffle
I'm so disappointed in myself
I'm now the owner of a slack instance whose name is an office reference
Gonna sync over all of wayfair's emojis?
why disappointment?
because I dislike the office
because I dislike the office
the TV show the office?
yes
Or, more accurately, I dislike that people use liking the office (the TV show) as their defining personality trait
I feel like the office has kinda left the limelight
I feel like the office has kinda left the limelight
I don't even know what the hot new show is these days
I had to watch the office episodes for a law class
Black list :)
Never Heard of it
yeah i saw an article about how too many people have 'jim to your pam' as their bio on dating apps

How did you end up as the office person for Wayfair?
How did you end up as the office person for Wayfair?
It's not Blacklist. While an interesting show, it's not exactly the new hotness.
what are you talking about?
I'd also say that blacklist isn't amazing; it's okay
<@UETS9HTSS> this statement, how did it come to be?
the workspace name is a reference from the show: the office
Ahhhh ok

Good Morning!
Good Morning!
The comments are the best part of the whole thing
Morning!
I thought today was Thursday, today is not in fact Thursday
No it's a very very sad Wednesday
Make sure to worship Wodin today, not Thor. 
It is a very sad Wednesday!
Is it a good morning or a very sad Wednesday?
How’d we get off good morning so quickly?
All wednesday's are sad
I mean can't it both be a good morning and a sad Wednesday?
but it's a good morning
Ah, I didn’t mean to delete your message. Meant to delete mine. 
I was wondering why this was deleted...
lol
<@UDC03KCGK> made me not an admin anymore. I don’t want to delete people. 
HAHAHAHAHAHA
TOO MUCH POWER!
I can suggest a few people to delete
:dark-mode:
Wait, seriously? I gave you that power because I didn't want you limited with implementing bots
eh, the test channel seems to work out ok for development for now. Clearly the bigger issue is me trying to edit my messages while still waking up
He deleted CJ!
That's a feature not a bug
Alright, since you asked, you are no longer an admin. However, it comes with a cost.
<@UDBGH9BMX> you've been unleashed.
Hope you all enjoy your chaotic Wednesday!
Anyone doing something fun today?
watching the compensation transparency stream
havent learned anything new though
Still important that those kinds of posts exist. When I was at Brigham, there was a girl who had been there over a year, knew so much and had so much work on her plate, and she was making $15,000 less because she had been fresh out of college. Made sure to share that info. They didn't pay up, so shortly after I was let go, she found a new job that paid her what she was worth
No this is corp speak which is, Comp is Competitive intel and we can't tell you because we can't risk our competitors knowing
Also learned how much I was underpaid before quitting Wayfair. Helped in terms of knowing what I could ask for when looking for new jobs
really??????
Yes...I'm not sure what's so surprising about that?
most people don't know what they're worth
Ugh, that's the worst and anyone with the slightest bit of finance knowledge or the term "arbitrage" knows that is bullshit
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
They pay for knowledge but they can't share that generalize stuff
It was honestly the first and only time I had any leverage to negotiate. The problem with Brigham is they asked what I wanted....then gave me exactly that. So even then, I didn't have leverage to negotiate because it was "Uh, yeah, that number I gave you earlier was, bullshit?"
LOL!
WF has this 'base' pay at level which isnt too far away from the ceiling for that level , so im surprised that you were underpaid. They cant pay you less that that base, right?
I mean look, I respect the hell out of people who stare into the face and negotiate for higher salaries and time off. Especially over the phone as opposed to being in the room able to talk a deal.
I just can't do that without any viable leverage, be it another offer, or a job I wasn't desperate to leave
Drew is referring to the fact our Base is lower than other companies bases
I just knew what I wanted and I got it, so I stopped caring
I negotiated a decent amount when I joined wayfair
Didn't quite get what I asked for, but something comparable
ah ok! so underpaid not within Wayfair but outside. Yeah agreed. And  if theyre looking at 'toast' and 'here' to get market value, im not surprised
Also that I switched departments and was underpaid for that department
see that doesnt seem ok.
They should have adjusted your pay when you switched.
But they didn't
and I only found out what I would've been getting by talking to coworkers who upon joining straight out of college were making $10k more than me
and the person who had just got hired as an L2 (I was still an L1) was making 25k more
Brenden, what was your leverage to negotiate when you joined Wayfair? Comfortable keeping your old job if Wayfair didn't work out? Had other offers? Balls of steel?
Comfortable keeping my old job, I was well loved
your manager really should have questioned that. that SUCKS.
Honestly as a manager, I rarely look at comp
I love power, my company gave me the ability to delete peoples account hehehe
I want more $$ 
Also CJ I was wondering <@UETS9HTSS>'s circumstances. I had talked to you about your CVS situation
every review cycle when  the comp sheet is delivered, I get notified that it is, asked to review and ask questions BEFORE it's available to reports.
I mean, Aysh, that is as simple as "Do you ever have bad employees?"
Same thing applies to the question "Do you ever have bad managers?"
Wait what??? I never get any of that stuff!
Did you? Or was it because it got lost in your email?
Also I would not put it past Wayfair to write this off as an Engineering side vs Business side distinction
ah i dont know about that. i get the emails from 'performance strategy'
Online stores and warehouses are open, but I have to ask: are retail locations also shut down? I can't walk into the mall and go into just about any of those stores right?
I'm just curious on what actually gets deemed non-essential
For the most part if it sells food, it is open
not sure about stores beyond that, like hardware stores and the like.
<https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/uber-to-lay-off-3700-employees-about-14percent-of-workforce.html>
:lol: how has that never happened before
it has
oh i never noticed
Yeah, Uber is not a great company in terms of ethics
And yet, I've also used them a lot more than Lyft
Lol this lost all meaning
they had 2 layoffs just before the EF layoff
*WF
"And yet, I've used them a lot more than Lyft"
AirBnB just announced a ton of layoffs as well
I tried to fnd toilet paper that didnt somehow bubble up the the Koch brothers. Found one, but it wasnt on sale. So much for my ethics.
Dat unemployment rate, it be skyrocketing
We are quite literally in Great Depression levels of unemployment
toilet paper all goes to the Koch Brothers?
I don’t think I’ve forgiven them for putting mustaches on cars.
That makes sense, it gets covered in shit and finds it's home in the sewers
Unemployment now is actually worse than during the great depression
After someone in London managed to use the credit card on my Uber account for a $90 trip I took my card off and almost entirely switched to lyft (only exception is when lyft isn’t available in another city)
Did you get the money back or the charge taken off for fraud?
Yep, and there's not going to be a magical "America is open again!" day that puts everyone back to work.
This is going to be sustained for quite a while
Yeah I did, it was flagged almost immediately by my credit card company
Sad Wednesday!
Oh good, glad you didn't wind up hosed for it
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/oct/03/kochs-conservative-patagonia-toilet-paper-interactive>
huh, Didn’t know that.
Also, do we still call them the Koch Brothers since David died? The Koch Brother? Charles?
oh one died?
August 2019

I looked up the date. I didn’t know that part off-hand
hmmm!

We have a DM as of this weekend
Yea I saw I have to set sometime now
What site do you use for character sheets?
Dicecloud
are you familiar with autochar?
no
post your dicecloud api key
and class/level/race of the character you're making here
ehh, fuck it don't post here
<https://andrew-zhu.com/dnd/dicecloudtools/autochar.html>
that site will create a dicecloud character for you
you'll still need to put in a bit of work, but it'll get the basics set up
similarly, if you need to add spells to dicecloud: <https://andrew-zhu.com/dnd/dicecloudtools/spellbook.html>
how do I follow up with someone to see if they finished a task, or what the timeline will be, when its already a favor to me that they are working on it? so its nice they are doing it, but still important to me to know if it will be done soon
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ummmmmm, do you have an update on that task please? No rush but would be good for me to know when it'll be ready so I can work on the next steps.
Please and thank you.
:sideeye:
Yeah. Whenever I had to do something like this, I'd always preface a message with a thanks for doing thing, are there any roadblocks they're encountering, and whenever they're done to let me know
Ahh the classic “woman in the workplace” response, I know it well
lol :smile:
this kind of thing _really_ irks me
tell us more Brenden :slightly_smiling_face:
But it's how we've been trained!

bot takeover :anarchy:
ill be honest, other than the hi and ummm this is how i would actually speak and now Im judging myself
"I have an idea..." is threatening?
WTF
(It’s a joke)
yep, just realized that
#1 wasn't too far out there
so it didn't click until 2
hahaha its funny because its true
I feel like this might deserve a thread of its own
BUG
<@UDC4QL95G>
this included a shared message that was deleted
I feel like this could be its own thread
I missed it, what exactly was the circumstance of the bug?
see the next message from me in the channel
it includes a shared message
that shared message was on the non-bot message of the parent of this thread
do you have any examples <@UHQD9J1SL>
I'm curious
sorry, I still don’t understand. What is the buggy behavior?
the bot axed half the message
me askign a direct report to schedule his permforance goals meeting
oh, the original post of this thread was part of the previous thread? and the replacement sent it to the main channel?
no
look at the most recent post in chaos monkey
the parent of this thread was like that
the shared message wasn't included in the bot message that replaced the parent message of this thread
nah that's fine
doug please share this message with the channel, but use the word o f in your message
```(no rush)
I would really appreciate any feedback you have with respect to```

still no red flags

im glad then
but im very careful when i speak
I'm very careful with my writing.
I tend to write with a formal tone.
Reading this back, did the environment change? Because I'm not seeing the original message other than when Aysh said it in a thread
I alwys start with 'I think maybe' instead of just sharing an opinion or an idea. I've started correcting myself when I do this
environment change?
I have no idea what you're talking about
you didn't use the word of
o-f
you need to annotate the share
I couldn’t tell what you actually wanted. You wanted me to share a message of you asking me to share a message?
yes
and annotate with the word of
the attached message disappeared
so you’re saying there is a bug with the interaction of censor bot and shared messages. ok, that I understand. It wasn’t one of our tested cases. Now that I understand that I can try to work on it.
also, Prometheus doesn’t censor me
of of of
Oh good, cause between the jokes about how women are viewed as having to come across as non-threatening, and my just general disdain for corporate speak, that email made me want to puke.
oh
then tell me when you're watching chaos monkey
I'll do it
which email???
its ok, I understand the bug now
You should be able to say, as this report's superior "Hey, there's new guidelines, so we should use these for evaluating your performance. I set up a meeting on your calendar for X time because you were free. Let me know if there is a different time that works better for you...then go update your fucking calendar because people should be able to just see open blocks and jump in. That will be on your evaluation!"
mhmm.. okay... sure.. wait.. what?
that escalated quickly
The last part was a joke
Everything up to "better for you" was not
Everything up to "better for you" was not
yeah, I can hear you saying the last part in my head actually
it's kind of weird
but also a very you thing to say
yeah- this is why Im judging myself Drew
Everything up to "better for you" was not
I try to write like I speak
the bot gods disappoint; that was a prime opportunity for a scramble
Except at work, where I try to soften it. For example "do you have an update on that task please? No rush but would be good for me to know when it'll be ready so I can work on the next steps.
Please and thank you." would be only a few words different from how I myself would write a ping for Doug's situation
Like, this dude had a total meltdown in a sprint meeting and i was like 'Maybe you could  be more wary of your tone and cognizant of cutting people off. What do you think'?
Yeah, no, that's the part where it is "I need to be clear: That is not ok and let people finish their sentences"
I don't know; that may set a bad tone for future interactions
That's one where tone needs to sell it.
there are other, less harsh, ways to sell it
I dont know if its a gener / workplace thing or this is just my personality thing
like as the manager, I wouldn't want to phrase it like them vs me
I apparently missed something fun having to actually work for a while
Look, only reason I jumped into this thread is I look at the joke post about Non Threatening Leadership for Women stuff and I think it is bullshit they should have to speak that way at all when a man could and get way less flak and more buy-in. So yeah, Aysh's email is "fine" and "no red flags" in that she hasn't done anything wrong. She just shouldn't have to be that soft of a touch in the first place.
have to be? no
"do you have an update on that task please? No rush but would be good for me to know when it'll be ready so I can work on the next steps.
Please and thank you."
Appropriate for anyone to be a good coworker, man or woman
If you share a message and Prometheus bots it, the shared message disappears
but is it desirable in a man or woman? probably
yes
maybe not to that extent
but more than what you've been throwing out as examples
I would say that quote is never appropriate
where is that from?
"Hey, there's new guidelines, so we should use these for evaluating your performance. I set up a meeting on your calendar for X time because you were free. Let me know if there is a different time that works better for you." could be more professional or slightly SLIGHTLY softer, but not much
Wait, Aysh's quote isn't appropriate? How would you change that?
"please and thank you." comes off not so great
in fact, that would raise my eyebrows
Yeah, I'd probably normally write it as just "Thank you for your help with this!"
as it seems a insincere afterthought
but, I don't really think it is wrong to say "Please and thank you"
My version is just how I would write and my own voice.
I'm so confused about what we're trying to do in this thread
no agenda
just picking eveything apart
I'm not going to make a blanket statement about "Please and thank you.", but at the very least in this scenario it doesn't seem sincere.
help-no-stupid-questions
but-yes-stupid-answers

I'm just asking if this slack instance changed. Because I didn't see the error live, and there were no artifacts of the bug you were describing.
I use self depreciating humor a lot
So is this something that just showed up on your slack viewer, but not on mobile or another person's? We've had that error before
watch chaos monkey and tell me when you're watching; I'll demonstrate
this would be visible to all
Is this our favorite Wayfairian to rag on (at least in the last month)
That's about as far as I go for being nice

that bot is currently disabled while I work on fixing this issue
Trollol
:eyes_rolling:
I maybe just threw gas on that fire
You know for the fun of it
/roll 2d20k1+2
My point is Aysh, and most women I've talked to about this, have had to be WAAAAAAY too soft in emails and such than male counterparts
BE MORE MANLY AYSH!
ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GIMME THOSE TESTOSTERONE PILLS
But that's the problem CJ, she would get unfairly judged for doing the same exact thing you or I would do in an email
That's about as far as I go for being nice
this would be visible to all
Right, so Aysh, you need to trade in your female parts for male parts, and go kick ass
.......
Can I pass?
NO
I think you can just face the consequences and unfair dichotomy of the world and just talk like any man would while telling people off who try to say you are being "threatening"
Maybe now I want the power to delete CJ :stuck_out_tongue:
Interesting*.... strokes facial hair*
Aysh, you should kick them in the balls and be like "THAT'S ME BEING THREATENING BITCH!!!"
Drew- point is that its so ingrained that even though I dont agree, I end up behaving like it
Done. Sorry <@UDBGH9BMX>
Just gotta go full nuclear
I believe it should work now. Our previous version didn’t car about attachments at all. I had to include them throughout the call trace. but will most likely work now.
Oh I get that Aysh, didn't say it was conscious. Just that you shouldn't have to, and you'd probably face unclear circumstances for it
I have to be honest- if someone (male or female) didnt sound 'nice' I would be surprised. Hasnt been my experience (80% of the time)  at WF
DIDJA GET YO ANSA
oh yeah, I sent that message ages ago, before the thread imploded on itself. :smile:
what was the message YOU sent
&gt; Were you able to look at the order creation any since that call with {other person on call yesterday}? I think {my manager} gave you a copy of the payload and the information we need(?) I know {my teammate} is currently working on getting the consumer up.
wow how rude
oof, you’re going to keep me up at night with social anxiety
i kid i kid
but the trapdoor leads to somewhere fn
fun
fun for CJ or fun for the DM?
fun for LYFE

When does the window open?
Morning y'all! It's no longer a sad Wednesday. Instead it's almost Friday!!
There's an all hands that's not on my calendar and I can't seem to find a link to it
I’ll share it with you
thanks
The markets open at 9:30. I’m just assuming from the graphic Wayfair put up that our window is for entire days, so it’s probably 9:30 as well. <@UETS9HTSS> does that sound right?
so i checked, thats correct bu if you schedule something evening the evening before and choose standard trading day (and not some extended hours thing) it will basically sell when the market opens only- so it works out the same
When this all is over, I will go to restaurants SO much more.
lol
You mean you don't like saving all the money eating at home?
I feel like once there is a vaccine I’ll never want to see my apartment again.
Move out entirely to erase all the bad memories?
I'm just sad how many places aren't surviving the stay at home orders, one of my favorite bars already has a lease sign in the window
I re-signed my lease for the year. but yeah, after that, so summer 2021 I could look at somewhere else.
meanwhile I'm sitting over here like: gosh I spend so much less money during quarrantine
I want to travel. I am being 100% honest when I say that I see places Ive traveled to in the past as I fall asleep.
I have recently dreamed of walking through H-mart and just sitting down at a restaurant and reading the menu.
I do miss go-go curry
:drool-blob:
I can say that at least I know most of these. I count three I’ve not heard of.
supposedly he plays a couple of games per night
so likely isn't a one-time thing
I did the same!
```1. Salt```
I did the same!
```1. Salt```
off. Dakota. Dakota. Dakota.
yeah i never learned to cook
Someone was on a 8-bit binge
Though I suppose i do tend to keep some chili oil in the fridge if that counts
Salt!=spice no
I mean, I'll be working there, so yeah...
Oh no which one?
huh? How is salt not a spice?
salt is rocks we put on food.
what is MSG?
And Sugar
MSG is better tasting food rocks
Sugar is plant energy
I didn't actually know you could buy MSG.
You can buy msg separately :)
So much stuff to do
I'm on unemployment and we are adding money to our savings. Shit's wild

Ok, do you manage to go through your cilantro though? Whenever I buy it, it comes in a big bunch or in a bag and I just can't possibly use it all before it goes bad
you should be able to freeze or dry any you’re not using for future use.
The automatic in kendall
Unfortunately had never heard of it, and now can't ever go :disappointed:
I'm actually concerned about a lot of places in kendall as the rent was already high
It was a good basic bar, simple but amazing food menu, good beers
Is it just on my slack where Chaos Seed has been posting to channel instead of in a thread?
It posts almost exclusively to the channel for me
No weird bug that hates only certain people
I’ve been seeing it too
And not reproducible
I find it funny that I never see this bug
That's the thing with bars, you need different bars for different atmospheres and situations. Sam and I have a lot of cocktail bars we would go to, but they had their own niche situations, but we also had a good dive bar and sports bar. Losing your basic bar can be a real hit
Yeah, I like having different bars for different moods
i deleted it, hopefully that deletes it for everyone else
I've never seen this bug
I've excluded  'mixed' spices like Garam masala/ taco seasonin etc. Ill probably have 5-6 more if i do

But also- where does that stop? whta about pesto/ salsa?
I make cilantro pesto btw
Interesting. Sam is not a fan of cilantro, so that probably wouldn't get much use. But I should start freezing it or something to preserve it for fresh salsa in the future
does baking soda count?
as a spice? no
I need more dried herbs
Or chimichurri, or chutney (<https://www.feastingathome.com/cilantro-mint-chutney-recipe/>)
I saw the bug a while back. not recently though
Did we ever figure out what caused it?
Also <@UDC4QL95G> I MISS YOU!!!! Work From home makes you around so much less
What do you cook usually Aysh?
It think it is just a server bug that we can't really do anything about.
Yeah I really need to get back to writing a bot at some point. So many left unfinished.

yeah, and i think that is why it messes with my head so much. It's just a slight difference, so I have a hard time thinking about what time it really is. especially since one dumb widget on my phone is still locked to boston time

GM’d an improvised RPG with coworkers today. Last time we did this they invaded an enemy battlestation dressed as girl scouts selling cookies. This time their plans were much more reasonable, except they were made by the doctor who referred to the rest of the crew as “expendable engineer” and “expendable scientist” etc. Of course that’s the person the party put in charge.

Coconut milk pulao- rice that works great with the curry above but also is yummy on its own
Link to very similar recipe <https://youtu.be/ljJv7ZT_h5U> : 
• Rinse and soak 1 cup of rice (Basmati or Jasmine) for 10 minutes
• Heat 2 tbsp oil. _Optional: Saute 2 tbsp cashew nuts._  
• Saute 1tsp cumin seeds, 2 pods cardamom (crushed), 1 inch cinnamon, 4 cloves, ½ tsp fennel seeds and 1 bay leaf
• Add .75 medium onion, 1 garlic clove and .25 inch ginger ground to a paste (or finely minced). _1 slit thai green chili is optional_. Fry till onion is translucent. Add a pinch of salt- it'll help the onions sweat.
• _(Suggested if you want to add veggies, not required, add 1 carrot, 5 green beans and 2 tbsp peas all chopped to the same size as the peas). Cook till carrot starts turning slightly yellow._
• Add .5 to 1 can of coconut milk (if you're pairing it with something very spicy like the 2nd curry above, more coconut milk is better). Otherwise half should be good. _I like to add some mint leaves at this stage (Ground with the coconut milk if you dont like picking things out of your food)_
• Add the rice and salt.
• Add water till there is water 2cm higher than the surface of the rice (or however much water you usually add to your rice) 
• Cover and cook till water evaporates (Or however you generally cook your rice. You can do this straight in an instapot/ pressure cooker/ rice cooker) 
• Suggested: Sprinkle french’s fried onions on top.

So i was on another flight, and every seat other than the middle ones are full
and just before we take off, some girl decides she wants to sit next to her boyfriend, and just sits down in the middle seat right next to me...
I mean, I imagine the airlines are reducing the number of flights
like... really??
should have swapped seats with her
I did
good
cough on her
Nah, coughing on a "full" flight seems like a bad idea
weirdly, airlines are flying “ghost flights”. so there are a bunch of packed planes and a bunch of empty planes. So the average capactiy per flight is only 10 people per plane, but to most travelers it still looks packed
sir you've been _randomly_ selected to be bumped off this flight and onto the next one; we're sorry for the inconvenience
Yeah my flight out was empty, my flight back in was full
was just reading this today:

Hm, I’ve never tried it with a posted file. I’ll have to see what the event looks like.

My guess is that the picture is considered an attachment to the original message
so with the original message gone, so is the pic
If so, censor bot should actually have worked. I added attachments when Brenden wanted to share a message without the censor messing with him. 
Replacement actions respects the “attachments” portion of the event now.

This comment on the thread moved me:
"We do all our standups sitting down, because they're far, far too long to do standing up.

We're excellent at missing the point."
its worse when they do it to real people.
They look like sci fi dystopia propaganda posters. 
yeah, the man in the pic you posted looks suave as hell.
The guy in the Did you Know looks a rejected model for an Easter Island Head
kanban has a purpose
it's distinctly separate from scrum/agile
<@UDC03KCGK>
And yet it was and usually is presented as a form of agile
"The term _agile_ (sometimes written _Agile_)<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#cite_note-3|[3]> was popularized, in this context, by the _<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto|Manifesto for Agile Software Development>_.<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#cite_note-AgileManifesto-4|[4]> The values and principles espoused in this manifesto were derived from and underpin a broad range of <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process|software development frameworks>, including <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)|Scrum> and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)|Kanban>.<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#cite_note-5|[5]><https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#cite_note-LarmanGuide-6|[6]>" from the top of the Wikipedia page
my understanding is that kanban came first and helped inspire agile
I'm with doug, Wayfair will lead the way to sci fi dystopia
<@UHQD9J1SL> I had no idea where Pariah came from.  Where did you hear it and get annoyed?
If I'm reading the History section on the Wiki correctly, Scrum and other Agile methods developed in the early 90's (Scrum in 1995 apparently) and the manifesto above where we get the term "Agile" was 2001.
Kanban was 2004 in Microsoft, and not popularized until it had its own publication in 2010
I didn't know about the origin till very recently. 
It is the name of a class of people who were not allowed to enter temples and dine with other people and 'untouchable' because of their 'blood' and the British borrowed it to use as a word for an outcast.
I went to college with someone who tried to hide that she was from this caste for fear of being judged.
interesting
What little I know of the caste system makes it sound as fucked up as just about any other culture's systems of segregating people on arbitrary distinctions
Neat, I only know about untouchable from Simpsons Road Rage where if you lost with Apu he would refer to it
Its terrible and still prevalent.
I dont use my 'family name'- no one in my state does- We take our fathers first name as our last names.
A very brilliant man made that rule because last names reveal what caste someone belongs to and he wanted to take away the stigma someone would face the second they said their name
What a mean person
Was that a recent change?
no, at least 3 generations - 4 if you include that I am old enough to have children and for that to not be a surprise to people
Damn son! That's crazy
WF people, you see we’re getting a longer weekend for memorial day?  5-day weekend.
I still haven’t gotten the email but I’ve heard rumblings
```to facilitate this reset, we are providing you all (US WFH salaried OpEx employees) with the opportunity to take off May 21 and 22 (the Thursday and Friday before Memorial Day weekend) with no deduction to PTO days.```
I’m assuming we’re all OpEx? I’ll admit I’m not 100% on who that covers.
I'm not either
That message is not readable in dark mode...I'm guessing wf are going back into the office in june then?
A couple of people on my team have gotten the email but not everyone
Really? Slack doesn't support it's own code blocks in dark mode?
"to facilitate this reset, we are providing you all (US WFH salaried OpEx employees) with the opportunity to take off May 21 and 22 (the Thursday and Friday before Memorial Day weekend) with no deduction to PTO days."
Everyone at Corp is gonna be considered OpEx.  The places that aren't are logistics field, call centers, sales.
That being said I know some teams are trying to figure out coverage plans because things like the WOC always need to be staffed
I changed to normal mode to read it, then switched back to dark mode
are corporations that nice?
I hope this whole thing gets people to rethink work. There is a lot of research that 4 day weeks or 6 hour days is actually good for business. 
Allow me to be paranoid.
I’m happy to have a job but I’m afraid of people knowing when I will be back at work. 
I don't know, my first response was ' what's the point for me, I can't do anything' but my second was 'whats their motive'
Yeah I'm very neutral on this

I would have never met you awesome people, or people on sister teams
I think going into the office is like training, you can turn it off and it'll be a while before you see the loss in productivity
Yeah, i would strongly prefer to go back into the office. If that doesn't happen, i'll likely leave boston entirely.
Yeah, i would strongly prefer to go back into the office. If that doesn't happen, i'll likely leave boston entirely.
I wouldn't mind the option to work a day or two a week from home, but I need to work in an office
The option to work from home is great, only working from home sucks.  And that's what all the crazy people don't get is, we'll normalize working from home, but there will always be a pull to be in the office because that's where all the social interaction takes place. And we're social creatures
Also, training in person and collaboration is always easier in person

TBH I'd be estatic if we go full WFH
That would help me move away from Boston immensely
Don't like boston, where would you go?
Most people hate having the pressure and don't get the sense of enjoyment from learning that you do
Somewhere with cheaper real-estate like Denver
Less about the learning, and more about the problem solving/puzzle for me
Would you go out to the middle of no where Wyoming or Colorado?
Denver is a cool city.
Ok same difference to me
I kind of want to move to Copenhagen, but a 6-hour time difference would be a bit hard to do permanently. Also I don't know if I'd be able to get a visa.
I also really like the problem solving/puzzle aspect
and you still have to pay some US taxes when living overseas
Just saying some people don't and that makes criticals suck
Also generally have to pay local taxes too
For sure
I have an acquaintance who just settled in Copenhagen, and I think she does freelance, so there must be a way to get visas
that's good to know. I've not studied it too hard, just a quick google search
No

I love the cold
Are we talking outside or in your apartmnet. 59 outside doesn't seem to bad
currently 66 in my room
Cold is easier to deal with than hot
I like cold when trying to sleep, I do not like the cold at the computer
it's 75 in my house :crying:
I'm so sorry
I'd be sweating my ass off
I am
Unfortunately Ashley being cold trumps daddy being comfortable
space heater/burrito blanket
i dont turn AC on unless I have to, something about 'enjoy the warmth, you whine so much when its cold' so my central heating is off now
and its cold indoors
but when the sun starts setting, apartment is flooded with light and becomes a greenhouse and its hot
Random, but you live in one of those "luxury apartment complexes right?" I'm thinking of moving into one, and didn't know if you had thoughts on things I should be aware of
Yea.... that works but not when we transition rooms
And yes even in a baby burrito she still gets cold
lol
Aysh you just don't sound happy with the temp
im never happy with anything CJ :smile:
I like this new temperature in our house

It's TERRIBLE!

No Hanabi

So much Hanabi  
Although, seriously, my family has been liking Hanabi so I’ve played too much recently. 
They like games, but do not want to learn more than 1 set of rules a month. 
ewwwwww
ewwwwww
Hanabi is great, but I'd rather talk to you guys than watch you stare at your screens again
There are so many other games out there. 
Including Avalon. 
I always liked the cold.
Then I got a balcony.
Being outside in the cold, even when bundled up, is just not the same as relaxing in the sun and some heat.
Yep, not at all the same; I'd say being outside in the cold is better
Are people talking about playing games today? I feel like I missed something with the last 20 messages
We were talking about ways Aysh might use her 5-day weekend
Thanks, that put 2 and 2 together
I'm with CJ, did not like Hanabi online. Avalon online basically feels like the real thing, with some tech advantages to make it super clear what the proposed team is

`Completely random....has anyone ever had problem w/teeth grinding?` From the girl who uses Wayfair as google
Best part is, posted in non-work Covid
I don't want to be mean because I don't know her, but she's the worst
I mean she definitely doesn't leave a good impression
And I mean clearly I'm ok with Chaos, but this girl.... I just kinda want to know what goes through her head
Like what is the decision criteria, because I can not figure it out
It just seems like she's incapable of googling things
I wonder what her team thinks of her posts
Either she is the sweetest human being ever, and they think it's fine, or they think she's insane
The flip is maybe she's learned to post in random places because it makes it harder for people to figure out she's insane
Like if you only see it once it's not terrible
Yeah...dunno...seems completely mad to me
maybe she just wants friends :disappointed:

I had a coffee table that i wanted to put somewhere. I put it in front of the front-door because I barely open it. Havent moved it in a week.
there’s a park not too far from you. Have you gone out for a walk?
nope
too sunny
It has to be overcast, not birght.
Slightly humid
Warm enough to not need a sweatshirt
Cool enough that regular denim wont feel sultry
Gentle breeze
Where can I find that

not until Autumn
you said AUTUMN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
or possibly like 8pm
?
but then , curfew
North americans say fall
I’ve heard it both ways here.
I figured autumn would be less likely to be misinterpreted here, since I was changing contexts.
good to know. its a much nicer word than fall
I’ll keep that in mind
is there a curfew right now?
isnt there? i dont know
ok, I looked it up. In Boston (which I know isn’t where you live) the mayor is heavily suggesting non-essential workers to stay indoors between 9pm and 6am. He did note that getting delivery after 9pm is totally fine.

so a suggested curfew, doesn’t seem like anything in legal force.
got it
you’re in Medford, right? I’m seeing no curfew there either.
maybe ill head out after 8pm then

im in between medford, somerville and everett. like, the exact junction
hm, each city can have its own rules. so that’s a little complicated
lol yeah- thats why i was glad masks were mandated across the state
I say both
I should have some masks getting delivered from Amazon today.
be good to finally have something real-ish
Because the office isn't in a plane
I always say Autumn, it's just a prettier word, fall just seems so harsh
Only get 2 months of leave :( half pay too

Yup working from home
I’m just going to answer in chinese
No Alexa 
Solid way to end up with a bilingual kid. 
Of course so we can speak in front of CJ and he won’t know what’s happening
Siri
Eventually you’ll get a bilingual CJ. 
So people don't seem as interested in games this weekend or next. Everyone doing ok?
I have to go back to work to train someone that I know may be let go soon....

Oh...... that’s........... uncomfortable 
I'm kinda just really looking forward to turning my brain off for the entire weekend and doing a whole lotta nothing. i'll plan for next week next week.
I'm still interested in games

WFH extended until September 8th for Wayfair
WFH extended until September 8th for Wayfair
Holy Shit September??
Not mandatory WFH, but they won't *require* you to come in until then
Not surprising, still sucks. 
/roll 1d20 + 1
Ah ok that's better
Yea, I can't really see them opening up the whole office till a vaccine is available or most people have had this thing.
It’s unclear that getting it once gives much protection. 
Most of the catching it a 2nd time stuff seems debunked.  The bigger question is how long the immunity is for
```I hope all of you are doing well and taking care of yourselves. We are busy thinking about our office reopenings even though there remains uncertainty as to when we will be able to allow people back on site. As promised, we are committed to sharing information as it becomes available and with that in mind, we have determined that we will not require employees in our Boston, Berlin, and London corporate offices to return prior to September 8, 2020. 


As we think about our return, we do know that some of our offices will be able to open up prior to September, allowing some people to return earlier. We  understand that some of you would like to be back in the office and as we determine that it is safe to return in accordance with government guidelines, we will communicate this on a site by site basis. We have established this September 8 date for these specific locations to remove uncertainty and to enable all of you to adequately plan for the upcoming months whether this involves caregiver needs, apartment leasing decisions, travel plans, etc. We are also working through timelines for WFH employees outside of our Boston, Berlin, and London offices and will be communicating directly with these team members soon.


Of course, there are many new precautions and evolving guidelines to consider - including workspace layouts, commuting, PPE, and more - and we will diligently work through all of these questions and update you on our progress. We appreciate your continued support as we navigate these unprecedented times, and I, for one, am so looking forward to being back in the office with you all when the time comes. ```

yes
give us the insider info on her
is she sane?
does she think we're all her personal search engine?
She is, she's... Interesting. She's Russian, born and raised, moderate accent. I didn't spend too too much time with her bc she was on the business side
And I didn't really get to know that team too well
LOL!
all I took from that was:
&gt; Me: Is she sane?
&gt; Dave: She's Russian.
I think that's the appropriate takeaway
People who don't get/laugh at my jokes I can't connect with. And she was one of them
Yea it sucks... I don’t wanna train someone who I have to say good bye
LOL
So she's basically insane
Got it
Haha, I'll take that as a compliment
Ummm I don’t think that will happen but he gets a few words right now like roasted pork bun 
Lol no Ai in the house
I TRY!! Mei is SUCH A BAD TEACHER THOUGH!
hey, my plans fell through half-way. We could use one more player for a space-themed RPG one-shot I’m running? Like right now-ish?

Decided I don't want my browsing sold to the highest bidder
So now my phone and web browser traffic is routed through a VPN
Not gaming traffic though
Maybe I'll finally get around to setting up a pi hole
Swapped from chrome to Firefox as well last night
Thought I'd miss some things, but the container features seem quite nice
There's literally an extension that containerizes all your Facebook traffic so that all the tracking they do is limited to their own sites
Going to set up personal and work containers next so I don't have to use incognito/private window for work tabs
Maybe I'll get around to doing my taxes finally after that
Damn son
That is some good work
I'm way to lazy
Oh I knew there were a lot of dialects, but my understanding are dialects aren't unique languages (much as a Spanish speaker from Spain would feel out of place talking to a Colombian.)
Main point was about "Chinese" isn't specific enough.
That and I really don't grasp the immediate repercussions of my data being out there. Long as I'm not losing passwords and having money funneled out of my accounts, I'm not sure the effort to protect my data is justified by the potential "loss."
Please correct my ignorance where you can.
My nephew was suggesting Vivaldi, because of the encryption aspect and you literally don't need an account.
You don't need an account for firefox either?
Also generally I've seen recommendations for Firefox for privacy concerns. It's also open-source, so you don't have to be concerned with shit hiding in the source code.
I'm seeing brave and firefox as the top two options; with firefox as the more customizable option
did you see what happened to burr?
Who? What?
He listed Brave as well for maximum privacy, but that Vivaldi had the endless customization part.

Might try to implement a Slack/GroupMe integration today
Trying to get hometown friends to make the move from GroupMe to Slack
WTF is group me?
One of the worst group messaging apps ever designed
The appeal was that it supported people who didn't want to download the app or have dumb phones as it would send all messages from a single number with the message prefixed with the sender's name
It's now owned by Microsoft
Uhhhh ok it sounds terrible
This doesn't really help correct my ignorance. A senator made super large trades with probably insider info. I don't see your point.
It was/is
Is it like a crappy Skype?
It's like crappy WhatsApp
Which is already crappy
So, shit sandwich?
It's more everyone on the hill does it. Barr is chosen because he's defying trump
Everyone does something illegal, probably cause keeps it from you being individually targeted. Without probably cause, you picked because you pissed off the wrong person
Hey I see chaos seed in the main channel on my phone
Hey I see chaos seed in the main channel on my phone
Weather right now is perfect.
So I should take Ashley outside?
Yes, if she likes the same weather as I do
Which is why the law that got passed is dangerous. I just feel like the me getting targeted part is super small by percentage. This is a problem that is going to affect the 1-5% that gets caught up in it (and I think 5 is very high). Not the kind of thing that 20% of people with unsecured data are going to regret it.

It's like when you see dumb hick republicans argue against estate taxes, not realizing it will NEVER ever come up for them, and the people they defend are ones who are pilfering them blind
So yeah, if I go on and become a mega wealthy 1%er or start getting super serious in politics that I'm under the spot light, this stuff becomes super focused. No offense to you or Brenden, but I don't think any of us are suddenly thinking "Better cover my ass so the SEC doesn't start investigating me for talking with former employees!"
No drew, this is where like some dude who's a local cop decides he wants Sam, so he literally throws you in jail for whatever he wants
That's where this road leads
Maybe not this step, maybe not the next one. But it ends with KGB
You're missing my point: the law is bad and follow up laws lead to worse outcomes. Completely agree.
However, what does me masking my data help prevent that from happening?
Ohhhhh, harder to pin YOU down
If we're in a KGB outcome, wouldn't I have to literally mask every account and data ever? Wouldn't that mean I don't have a LinkedIn, or use this Slack, or perform financial transactions on any brokerage? I totally get how I can reduce the amount of my data is out there, but most of the "incriminating" stuff is out there unless I'm using a vpn, and only talking on the most dark web of chats and forums. Where am I missing the picture here?
This isn't me trying to make an argument against the importance of it. I'm trying to understand how one does this with any level of real success without being completely counter culture.
Can <@UETS9HTSS> make all the changes he's just described in the channel, and still maintain a LinkedIn, be a member of this Slack, have a Facebook, and maintain a Youtube or Twitch account with subs and favorites, and still be as secure as he would need to be for KGB level security?
Especially if any of these companies get breached, like his broker or bank, and a bunch of that info is leaked anyway?
Now the government needs to subpoena each individual company to get the info they want, they can't just ask my ISP nicely
Many of these companies have the legal recourse and financial weight to take a stand and say no
ISPs don't give a fuck about the consumer; they're already selling your data
If data gets breached, that's still a single account, not all of my accounts/info
I'm eliminating a single point of failure, and preventing my data from being monetized at an aggregate scope
Compare this to the Equifax breach; what if your ISP got breached
Thank you, these are all very real answers to very real questions I had.
So is the Google piece of it avoiding that point of failure as well since they are so ubiquitous?
I'm not sure I follow you; could you clarify what you mean here?
You mentioned switching from Chrome. Can you elaborate on what that does for you? Is it ISP focused, or Google focused in terms of masking data?
<https://www.fastcompany.com/90174010/bye-chrome-why-im-switching-to-firefox-and-you-should-too>
Google focused
So that's what my earlier confusing question was. Google is another point of failure like an ISP?
Wishing I was building a deck
You can take my place...
Happily, especially if the deck project extends beyond this weekend.
Didn't realize you liked building decks
Another point of monetization
I like construction.
Oh, that's nice! I prefer to hire someone to do it for me :grin:

Oof, slack mobile app must have just updated for me. Looks very different. 
Guess I should get a business going and keep the money amongst friends then
I've gone out of my way to put together other people's furniture for them. #1 most valued service I provide to people moving to new places.
Yeah, it's taking some getting used to. I don't think it is a bad update.
Very different
I like t he change
My problem is I never used Tinder, so when it says swipe right and swipe left, I don't think about the way I move my finger across a screen.
The swiping is a little weird
You ever really thought of doing that? Flipping houses? I effectively did that for my condo and essentially loved for free for 3 years and made 20k

We need to finish it, so framing, design, electrical, drywall, painting.... the list goes on and on
Alright, certainly don't know the finer details of the framing and electrical parts, but I've done drywall and painting before, and certainly up to learning how to do framing and what not properly.
Alright, certainly don't know the finer details of the framing and electrical parts, but I've done drywall and painting before, and certainly up to learning how to do framing and what not properly.
I've always thought of it in terms of take an under market price piece of property that has a lot of damage, but has solid construction, and restore it in order to flip it.
Which requires the capital to pay for at minimum the mortgage on the unlivable property, and cost of materials in order to actually do the work. Plus equipment or outsourcing higher level training parts such as plumbing and electrical.
Framing is easy, 2×4 studs every so far apart!
Main constraints for me are: Sam does not want to live in a house in that condition. Thus needing to pay rent and mortgage. Also we've been a bit picky about where outside the city to live.
Doesn't even have to have a lot of damage, could just need updating
Yeah, I mean cover my transport there and feed me, and I'll show up every Sunday.
True, my own apartment being an example of that. That goes back to where we are willing to live and how often willing to move.
Will let you know when we start, need to come up with the design first and then electric work 
Forclosures *can* be a good place to do it too. At least from my experience haha. Tho I hated the summer i spent cleaning it up

Can you tell me more about your foreclosure experience Dave? What did you end up getting the place for, and what did you sell it for? Or at least how much cheaper was it as a foreclosure than other units in that building?

Is there a good gif alternative
idk, I only use giphy in the slack integration. My guess is that there isn’t going to be anything else with as extensive a library.
`/gifs` is a thing if we were to install it
generally I've preferred giphy though
So what are you going to use as a search engine? I guess between avoiding Facebook, Google, and those extended services, you start quickly racking up quite the number of sites and services to avoid.
You misunderstand; I don't avoid those sites
You misunderstand; I don't avoid those sites
I isolate them

To expand: by containerizing facebook, all its tracking cookies and such don't follow me everywhere I go
Learned that YouTube (Google) will delete any comment containing the mandarin characters for "communist bandit" within 15 seconds of being posted. The translation doesn't literally mean bandit, it's more like a slur like "commie bastard".

Also learned that <https://old.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/|/r/worldpolitics> is a hellhole of memes, warhammer 40k, jojo, and tits, whereas <https://old.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/|/r/anime_titties> is a solid source for world politics news.
Wait... what?
Since when?
Unsure
I accidentally made a duplicate order on wayfair- cancelled in 10 minutes but theyre still shipping both :confused: on hold.
It is Monday.
Seriously, and very early on Monday
Brenden keeps sharing links I cant open from work laptop :
lol
Live press conference from Charlie Baker is at 11am
Live press conference from Charlie Baker is at 11am
hm, I have a meeting then. I’ll have to read about it afterward.
I'll live "tweet" it to a thread if that's helpful
Whose Charlie Baker
if he says anything interesting
<https://lmgtfy.com/?q=charlie+baker>
too much effort
and you guys rag on that girl at Wayfair for doing the same thing
and you probably should have heard of the governor.
I mean, i don't watch tv, listen to the radio, or look at local news, or vote. Not really sure when I would have heard the name.
Any time there was an update on the extension for lockdown in the state of Massachusetts...
i didnt know till the lockdown. I still confuse him with Walsh
I didn't know him until the lockdown either
That's fine, you at least heard of him through the lockdown!
I get like all of my lockdown news through this slack channel
His name has definitely been attached to headlines of several posts in this channel about lockdown news
possibly, but how often does the article headline really stick in your head. We discuss the contents of the article.
I love the lack of masks and social distancing in the live feed
Finally figured out a webcam solution
Am now using my phone's back camera on a tripod as my computer's webcam
MA Gov Charlie Baker livestream highlights thread :thread:
Starting with 4 phases, each phase to last at least 3 weeks
May 25th and June 1st for more parts of the government to open. Today is just construction and manufacturing
uhhh personal webcam?
May 25th office and retail can reopen....except in Boston
at 25% capacity
Places of worship can open today, but with new rules and limited capacity
Everyone required to cover nose and mouth if you cannot maintain distance. So basically stay covered.
like.. for google meet and shit.
what did you think I meant?
Businesses must have these standards in place by May 25th in order to reopen (I guess they gave Construction time or they don't need as much time)
So my area remains closed? :crying_blob:
Wonder how far out that boston restriction lasts
Yeah. Boston separately has required offices to stay closed till at least June 1st
Yesterday + today = perfrect weather. PERECT
Restaurants and Bars they only have a committee for coming up with new health and safety standards. Would not expect them to be part of phase 1, so not going to be open to public opening in the next 3 weeks.
Guidance to businesses being posted in advance for businesses to hit reopen dates.
Parks and youth league and what not will be in phase 2
It was unclear if restaurants and bars are phase 2 or phase 4 (I'm only talking about these because I figure people want to eat out or drink again, not because it affects me)
Website they keep referencing for more info <https://www.mass.gov/info-details/reopening-massachusetts>
Cause for work stuff I just use the laptop camera
you know lazy
Riders of Public Transport must wear masks, no exceptions
one of these days I’m going to exempt urls from bot replacements.
thanks Drew!
did they say anything about mask availability? Its one thing to require them, but are people able to get them?
agreed
Looks like you can still click the link though
yeah, it kept the attachment
I have heard nothing on the stream about mask availability. Face coverings from what I understand are ok if you use what you have.
So offices: wait till may 25, 25% capacity
Churches: Open Today, 40% capacity.

Not really sure what the logic there is
I also found 4 unused single use masks under my sink if someone needs them. Sam and I already have reusable cloth ones
Churches are considered more fundamental. Its harder to keep them closed.
I bought some masks off Amazon, made in Wuhan. :stuck_out_tongue:
They keep hammering keep workers home who can work from home. So not sure what the guidance to places like Wayfair are asked

&gt; Have anyone had to go to dentist recently? Noticed most likely developing cavity and trying to figure out if it's better to wait or go? Any experience here?
-YouKnowWho
I want my team to move to coming into the office one day a sprint for planning, then everything else at home.
eh, that one seems fine to me. The question of what medical services to postpone right now is a really complicated one.
Hmmm, I'm fine with that one
It's more the volume of questions at this point that amazes me
Pediatric care is open today in MA
but they have not mentioned dentists
`o'questions't` I love this bot
Schools officially remaining closed till end of school year
Hair Salons and Barbershops are part of phase 1
May 25th phase 1
I need a haircut, but I'll probably wait a few more weeks to let the onslaught go first
"Bars are defined as establishments that only serve alcohol and do not have kitchen areas that prepare food on-site."
They want to increase testing immensely, hitting 45,000 a day by July
I encourage you all to look up other questions you have or ask them here. I tried my best to filter out stuff that didn't directly effect any of us like stuff related to kids over the age of "baby" or them constantly thanking or recognizing the difficulties involved in all this.
my laptop camera doesn't work
hence the solution
Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous
but man is that translator awesome to watch. All about that suit and shirt combo
Oh yeah, he's great
Also, this is the first time Prometheus has attacked me with emotes
What a well timed emoji explosion
Very much so.
They are reemphasizing that each phase is AT MINIMUM 3 weeks long. They will keep reevaluating
You have been given fire.
Also, lot of people on /r/boston pointing out how dumb the places of worship opening is. However, from what I understand, it is harder to constitutionally keep those places shuttered
Yeah, but the guidance does say outdoors services suggested
HILARIOUS ENDING!
Agreed!
"Is the state going to be sued for this? Lots of other lawsuits already around the country"
Baker: *slaps folder
"We'll see!" *smiles and walks away
Also did you see the translator put on a face mask near the edge of the screen?
I do also wish there was better audio of the q&amp;a portion
I did not. Makes some kind of sense though. He kind of needs facial expressions. Plus, he's the one person on stage that clearly has 6 feet around him
Yeah, they don't repeat reporter questions which is large meeting fail #1
Yeah, they don't repeat reporter questions which is large meeting fail #1
He didn't though, there was a person behind him for the first half of the meeting
Yeah, they don't repeat reporter questions which is large meeting fail #1
I know it's harder, but you can actually speak into a microphone through a face mask, my CEO did it during the last company all hands
I'm with you: it's irresponsible to preach compliance while not being a model for it
However, I take MA government as at least taking this all seriously in a way that 80% of the country is not, most of all the Federal Government
Ohhhhh!!!!
Pediatric care in Attleboro never closed
Agreed, I think they're going to right way to opening things, I just think it may be a bit soon to be opening the whole state. There could be an argument for opening western mass while keeping the greater Boston area closed for another month
Well, clearly Marty Walsh and the Boston City Council have their own say in what gets opened or not
Yeah, but I meant more the whole area, Walsh only controls Boston, not the whole area of surrounding towns. A state level thing for the whole area is what I meant
An old man was standing at a traffic light yesterday waving a flag and with signs that said 'Keep Trump. Impeach Pelosi. Lockdown lie.'
He was yelling at people in cars wearing masks that they were not 'true Americans'
As a neither true, nor fake American who was also wearing a mask, I was very scared to walk by him. Took a longer route to acid him.
What did you use for the HCL, toilet bowl cleaner?
I’ve been feeling this for a while now, but this whole situation is really making it clear. There is something deeply wrong with Americans. Mostly white people. 
This whole situation made me very attuned, in addition to the last 3 years of politics, to how much of "America is the best" was our own forms of lies and propaganda growing up.
............................................. what, Drew?
"Took a longer route to *acid* him"
Not saying he didn't deserve it, just curious on your methods.
oh. avoid. :facepalm:
Autocorrect I'm convinced was written by developers with very sadistic senses of humor
I just wish all this shit hadn't happened during an election year, though the fact that the election year made it so much worse is in itself an indication of a broken system.
honestly, this wasnt autocorrect but my fingers not listening to my brain
Look, I despise Trump and how the Republican party has handled power. However, I will acknowledge their ability to question rules and precedents with a "Make me." attitude to really hammer home how much these systems were not designed well ultimately.
I am less concerned about which party did what. I'm more annoyed by the fact that they are so focused on re-election, that both sides are basically making up naratives and refusing to work together so that one side doesn't look better than the other.
So we have half the country believing that the democrats are locking people in their homes specifically to make trump look bad, and the other half of the country believing republicans are trying to turn the presidency into a dictatorship lead by a big orange monster.
Daka, I'll echo <@UDBGH9BMX> here, this isn't a "Both sides are the same" argument. Between election interference, the shit that happened in Wisconsin, trying to shut down the postal system, voter suppression techinques, small business funds being handed out to large corporations, confiscation of medical supplies by the federal government, deliberate allocation of resources away from hotspots and instead to "loyal" states, and so much more, this isn't a left wing conspiracy about how the presidency is dismantling our republic, it's some truly troubling stuff
See i don't really care which narrative is true, the fact of the matter is that there are 2 narratives, and half the country believes one, half the country believes the other, and they are so focused on putting the other side down that we are going to be locked inside for years at this rate.
I'm not advocating for anything. I'm complaining
I'm not sure what you advocating for. The failure to combat misinformation properly over the last couple decades is why we are in this. Are you saying the democrats, backed by evidence, accredited experts, science, and data, should just quit fighting deliberate misinformation by a side that can most accurately be described as a propaganda engine?
Because that side just leads to letting everyone out way too early, and watching a bunch of people die in order to "not put the other side down."
So honestly, what are you advocating for?
Drew thinking apathy means disagree is my favorite part of this thread
That isn't apathy. It may be exasperation, but it's clearly focused on the country reopening. Not saying it is wrong, but trying to frame both sides as the same and why won't everyone just get along is and has been dangerous. It's why we are in this mess as bad as we are and other countries aren't.
It is very much apathy on which side is correct. I don't care one bit if trump is making a power grab, or if the dems have concocted this entire scheme. If we open up now, people die. If we open up later, people are ruined economically and people die. If trump becomes president, we will become a dictatorship, if biden is elected, we will become socialists. Obama is the most corrupt president we ever had, trump is the most corrupt president we ever had. There is nothing but sensationalizing the extremes of possibility, and it's not worth sorting fact from fiction, since 90% of what you have to dig through to get some bit of truth is complete trash.

Nah, not about the country re-opening. More about extending the impact the virus has had.

This is fundamentally the problem. The thing you’re feeling is quite deliberately engineered. Its a pretty well documented technique. You don’t have to convince anyone of the truth if you can instead convince them there is no truth, or that is it too difficult to find. Its very clear in pattern of Russian bots, stirring up the extremes on both sides, and the Trump campaign, which “floods the zone” with outlandish comments they don’t really care about the truth of. I don’t really mean the point about Trump as a political opinion either. He (and his sons and other surrogates) regularly claim after the fact that their statements aren’t meant as truth. People want you to feel the way you do. I’m not saying you’re wrong to feel it, but it’s worth noting that some forces are purposely creating it.
Interesting. Definitely makes sense. I think from my perspective, view politics as a source of entertainment, and have no intention of ever participating, so digging to find truth has even less of a value to me. The entertainment value as of late is completely gone with how far people are taking things, and so I'm kinda just tired of the whole thing.
everything is better if its a ruse.
oh, thinking of trickster gods, I don’t know if it was clear in our DnD game, the spider god I mentioned was Anansi. I was always a fan of Anansi stories growing up.

<https://www.wilderutopia.com/traditions/myth/ashanti-of-ghana-how-spider-obtained-the-sky-gods-stories/>
what spider god
wait
is this from the last part that i missed?
did prometheus correct my spelling? :open_mouth:
no, a couple session ago. The temple where Deep hit on the tabaxi monk.

yeah, there is a bot where Prometheus will scramble the internal letters of a word.
silence chaos seed
it wasnt because i didnt kno of this god?
I just referred to it as “Temple of the Spider God” in the game. I didn’t really get into it too much. I did note that the monks were doing a lot of story-telling to local children, since Anansi is also a god of stories.
its not like the details matter too much to the game. you just made me think about trickster gods.
So someone put this as a response to this prompt in a dating app:
Prompt: `They key to my heart is`
Response: `Sending me unexplicited dog pics`
And the butchery of that word in the middle there really makes me want to match with this person just to let them know of their mistake
but I have no interest in the person
I SAY GO FOR IT!
lol dont be rude :smile:
She wants unexplicit pics, she's no bestiality lover
And she wants no Dick pics with dogs in em!
she wants an originally explicit photo that has the explicit parts removed. unexplicited
so she wants censored bestiality?
or, eh, typos aren’t the worst thing in the word.
I think it's less typo and more the wrong word, brenden is a little bit of a grammar nazi
oh yeah, its more a malaprop.
well it would be the wrong word, _if it were a word at all_
I think that's a word.....? Is it not a word?
wrong word, but a word
the boundries of what is and is not a word are pretty thin, especially when you use normal prefixes. English is absurdly flexible
I mean we have agreed on a definition, so it is word enough
<@UDDE5960N> that’s what a malaprop is
unexplicit is a word, but it's an adjective, not a verb
so making it past tense doesn't make sense
I TOTALLY MISSED THE FACT IT IS IN THE PAST TENSE!
except adding “-ed” is a common way to change an adjective to a verb.
what are some examples of that doug?
in english basically every concept can be shoved into any part of speech
But in this context, isn't the word actually a combination of
Unexpected and Unsolicited?
No?
Yellowed
Yes
I like this
Dakota coming in from left field
Huh? I mean the context of the typo
(I works with any color, but yellowed is the most common example)
Unexpected/Unsolicited both make perfect sense as the desired word
LOL!
Combining them, you get Unexplicited.
I see that now, but our minds clearly don't work in the same manner
to me, that -ed rule converting adjectives to verbs requires degrees
I agree with <@UDC4QL95G>, and I always saw the unexpected.
I mean it is a common mistake in human speech to accidently combine synonyms when describing something.
But I liked the new word because it's more hilarious
unexpected and unsolicited are considered synonyms?
they shouldn’t be
aren't they basically the same thing?
No..
they're certainly related
```Unsolicited: not asked for; given or done voluntarily.```
Their connotation may be different, but I'd certainly describe them as synonymous
no
I can expect something that was unsolicited
If a nice person offers to help you, their aid is unsolicited, but not unexpected
Something unexpected can be solicited
I can solicit for things and receive it unexpectedly
yup. I ask the dragon for help, its aid is solicited, but certainly unexpected.
Most people use it post fact as a synonym
by asking- isnt she soliciting
oh, very true.
now we have a paradox
:kermit:
That's like saying Awesome and Amazing are not synonyms, because something can be amazing, but does not conjure Awe
Kinda, but she is answering the question
Which is why I said post fact they generally are
Synonyms don't have to have the exact same meaning....
they have to share some meanings
in this case, unexpected and unsolicited share meaning
synonym: a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language, for example _shut_ is a synonym of _close_.
```nearly the same as another word```
where we differ in opinion here is how extreme `nearly` can be
if we go far enough down this road, I could say that apply is a synonym for orange because they're both fruits
within epsilon
ε
I would also argue that just because words are used interchangeably, doesn't make them synonyms
Yeah, I don't look at unsolicited as a synonym for unexpected at all. Other than they both use "un"
post fact!
why is aweful not a superlative form of awesome?
because english
∀ε &gt; 0 ∃δ &gt; 0 s.t. ∀x∈D if 0 &lt; |x-c| &lt; δ, then |f(x) - L|&lt; ε.
Wait.... how are dating apps going right now given the fact that people are deadly
they sort of arent
well, not true
odd story
I haven't been using them much
Ohhhh sad
other then seeing who matched with me
Some of us like to live dangerously CJ
Also let's be real, there are people who are going to ignore the stay at home
Thanks <@UDL020K8D> and <@UDC03KCGK>, y'all said it right
Don't really have anything to add
Appreciate you chiming in!
I walked by 2 people not wearing face masks on my way back from the store, so there are plenty of people willing to disregard
Walking today I think I saw more people with masks not covering their noses than people wearing masks correctly. 
The number of people wearing masks, but not actually covering their mouth/nose is pretty high as well
People wearing masks poorly is the name of the game
Something funny I read once:

Nazis: let's kill all the Jews!
Liberals: howabout we kill no jews, that's crazy
Moderates: okay, let's compromise and kill half the Jews
Nazis: sounds good to me
Liberals: wtf, no, are you crazy????
Nazis: So MuCh FoR cOmPrOmIse
Good morning everyone!! It's finally spring in mass
Good morning everyone!! It's finally spring in mass
Is this because we're finally allowed outside?
Nope, the weather is now consistently nice
You were always allowed outside. Just wear a mask. 
So windows are open!
You also still have to wear a mask, we are now mask people
It’s just part of clothes now. Like a jacket or pants. 
Nah, I don't see masks catching on here, too warm
But it's still illegal to not wear one outside...so for now we are mask people
how about removing dejavu for inactive slackers so its actually confusing?
We could probably do that. 
But... then what will we remember Rick by
Rick has been removed :rip:
Did you just comment out his line in the people constants?
yup
Eliminated
Aufweiderzened
FIRED
Out of a cannon. Into the sun. 
What a terrible fate
anything in particular right now? Or just the general fact?
yeah. both those businesses have to be hit pretty hard right now. Its not good.
the world is scary :disappointed:
more layoff news from uber and paycuts in yelp
yeah. both those businesses have to be hit pretty hard right now. Its not good.
I kinda expected it would be more common to be able to recite the alphabet backwards
Not everyone has a DUI
I only know it because I was bored one afternoon
Same. Bored at my grandma's house, and my uncle paid me like $10 to learn it
uncle had your best intersts in ind
*mind
I've also confirmed on several occations that reciting the alphabet backwards while drunk is no more difficult than when sober
anyone here good with essays and stuff?
sort of; what are you looking for?
I was a fine writer back when I was doing more essays. Do you need proofreading or something?
can i ask you to review 2 different essays to see if they read properly? admissions essay for someone else, but ive been working on them for so long that i cant tell any more
Sure. Although depending on what they are applying for, it can be a little iffy to get so much help with the essay. Then the admission people aren’t really able to judge the applicants abilities well. 
its to B schools, a couple of intimidating ones :smile: but i get what you're saying
I’m certainly not saying not to help or anything, just a thing to keep in mind. 
DMing
yeah, I'd be happy to read it over
thank you  :slightly_smiling_face:
Did we ever talk about roller coasters? Who here likes roller coasters?
Did we ever talk about roller coasters? Who here likes roller coasters?
not I
I love rollercoasters but I've found I can't do a whole day hard core on them anymore
I started getting really bad migraines, but then found out if I pop ibuprofen all day, there are no headaches
Have you tried any/many?
If I do too many that have loops back to back, I get a bit of vertigo
But ibuprofen is an adult's best friend
Honestly - I was afraid I'd not be able to do any more roller coaster trips, then tried it on a whim
You have a favorite coaster or park?
Coaster not really, but I do like the ones where you lie on your stomach/back. Park I grew up with a small one called Carowinds on the SC/NC border
What about yiu?
I love rollercoasters. Was what we did for my bachelor party because I was given the advice of "do something fun you won't be able to do much while married."
Sam's afraid of them.
Oh, nice!  Carrowinds is actually on my bucket list of parks to go to bc it has the #1 steel coaster in the world
And yea, flying coasters are great! There's a fantastic one in California called tatsu
Didn't realize that Drew! You should come on my next coaster trip :grin:
It's great, and right outside of Charlotte, so plenty to make a good trip out of it. They also have a water park, so easy to spend a day or so and not get bored
Yea, problem is that I don't know when I'll be in that area for anything else :sweat:. And it's not like California or DC that it's worth flying to for more than just coasters
Well if you ever find yourself in Tennessee or Georgia, it's a quick flight over
Standing in line kills my attention span
That's why you go with someone and chat :joy:
But the key is to go on weekdays - lines are almost non-existent
no im afraid of heights :smile:
Yeah, can't imagine waiting in line alone, but it can be fun with a group. Weekdays makes a ton of sense
So, I'll have to tell you this in person sometime, but I used to be afraid of coasters. "used to" as in, till I was 24
But then I went on one so my 12 year old cousin didn't show me up, and found out that I loved them
Which made me mad that Wayfair fired me in the winter... But then everything closed so...
If I have audiobooks, I don't mind lines
I can just zone out
The coasters that had corkscrews or loops terrified me until I was peer pressured into riding one, then I fell in love. But I've also turned into an adrenaline junkie, so don't take my advice
Yea this is not a good year for roller coasters
This is not a good year for much
It's a good year for videogames and ecommerce
it's a goodyear for a certain tire company
Always was an adrenaline junkie
this is always super anxiety inducing

now I just have to hope it boots back up correctly and I can remote back into it
otherwise :dumpster-fire:
Why don't you have your work laptop at home?
I prefer remoting in
fewer access issues
and I like my personal laptop
Interesting...I don't think I've ever met someone that felt that way
when I first joined, I had different access with my laptop plugged in at work vs VPN from home
that's what started this habit
:phew_3:
just got back on
woot woot!
So I feel like I am using my PC, but I am really using my laptop
I've never had luck with VPN. I just have my keyboard and monitors hooked up to the same keyboard/monitors my desktop, and swap between work laptop and pc with a few button clicks

Adrenlaine junkies unite...at least 6 feet apart. Maybe by skydiving
Well now you've met 2, because I'm with <@UETS9HTSS> on this one
I don't bring anything with me when I'm on coasters - too afraid of it falling out
I leave my phone in the car and only bring my wallet
Being stuffed in a tin can with recirculating air does not sound like social distancing!
Keys are always the thing that terrify me. Everything else I can kinda do without. Keys though open up a whole new level of pain
`I scheduled a dentist appointment with a new dentist and called them to double check their safety measures and that I will be first one with a doctor and they told me that I will be first one with the doctor but there also would be another person with hygienist at the same time with an OPEN floor concept, no walls. I can't believe it!` That has got to be my favorite, I'm entitled with no sense of reason I have EVER seen
Where is this from?
Non-work covid
Can you guess who posted it?
yeah, I knew before I even asked
I actually don't know. Ms LMGTFY or Rachel?
&gt; LMGTFY
&gt; LMGTFY
I mean, it's not like she's really wrong
Eh, yea. But I doubt my keys are going to break, and I think they have a lower chance of falling out of buttoned pockets
I actually do want to try skydiving
Whoever you are
Hi <@U013EM2E3EK> and <@U0141L5U02G>!
Whoever you are
Hi <@U013EM2E3EK> and <@U0141L5U02G>!
bad timing for the word scrambe
honestly indoor skydiving seems more interesting; you get more free fall time
I think you mean perfect time on the word scramble
They're people from Boylston who we did games lunch, I have to get 2 more people
It's more like the fact that she thinks going first is going to save her, or that somehow a dental office is either doing 1 patient at a time, or as complete revamped their floor plan
yea but the likelihood of me getting my keys back by the time i need them is way lower than the likelihood of me coming the next day to get my phone.
Well, I think you're passing over Dave's buttoned pockets remark. When I go on rollercoaster, I'm usually wearing a jacket or cargo shorts where I can try to secure keys or phones or wallets in more than just your typical front jeans open pockets.

Yea, I never wear jeans to parks. Cargo pants or shorts always. I'm more afraid of breaking the phone than keys. 

But it's worth it. And it makes me so sad bc I'm 15 minutes from Six Flags right now
Yeah, I agree with you that she sounds very entitled or at least completely unable to be realistic about how anything is supposed to work. 
Frankly, I didn't realize dentists were reopening already, and the fact that she can get a dentist appointment at all is a kind of luxury.
I've never thought about how long you get to straight free fall as part of a skydive. How much time does it take? 5 minutes?
To me actual skydiving has a more visceral element. That lack of 100% saefty, or even if you have that, just the relativity of watching things get bigger and come into focus is a huge part of the experience.
Fanny pack or a small backpack purse is the way to go
you freefall for approximately 30 seconds
you freefall for approximately 30 seconds
vs indoor where you can easily get minutes
plus indoors you have a frame of reference so you can see how moving/angling your body affects airflow and how you fall
I really enjoyed learning how to move my body to affect how I fly/fall
and hilarious as ever
urf is back

I wasn't skipping over, I was just more stating why I'm more afraid for my keys than my phone
I’m afraid of my glasses. It’s not like I can leave them in the car either so they make you rent a locker every time you take a ride depending on the park policy, so annoying
I mean it's always brokenly fun
They are getting rid of the open box discount...
They are getting rid of the open box discount...
Guess there's no more reason to shop at wayfair.
Ive skydived once though. it wasnt scary and the person with me helped me calm my nerves.
(tandem)
Dak- how about sending me some of those reward $ then
lol
I'm kinda surprised they're that focused on margins, i would figure for items like that fast turn over would be better
i also found that trying to find open box problematic
they're a doctor's office, so they're essential
not all dental work can wait
I'm aware you have to tandem jump first. That doesn't invalidate anything I was saying. People still get hurt and die during those jumps.
I'm not sure about dying, but you can get hurt doing anything. I've fractured an ankle walking on a flat surface. Anything you do you have to take your personal comfort of injury or death into it
What's Brenden doing over the LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG weekend
Probably not much productive
If I am productive it'll be one of two things
Cleaning up my room or doing my taxes
Otherwise, I'll likely be gaming or messaging people on Hinge
Maybe some workout thrown in there
My experience on the WDN was that returns, pallets they were trying to get picked up and paid for, and things like open box, would stack up in the warehouses and that space was a real issue for these things.
The Open Box discount was huge, and probably abused, but this seems like such a minor part of the balance sheet to be given much focus.
Heavy rains swelled the Tittabawassee River, causing it to breach two dams. City of Midland Michigan is looking at a possible 9 feet of flooding. 10K people under evacuation order.
its like the disclaimer on rat poison asking people to not drink it
if you dont use it right, it wont work
whoa doug
anyone you know there?
not directly. I have Grandparents who live a couple towns over, so they aren’t directly affected, but it still feels like my neck of the woods.
Wow, that's a huge event to happen to those people. Hope everyone makes it out ok.
You're jumping from over 10,000 feet in the air. The parachute doesn't deploy, or the backup, you're in most cases, dead.
I wonder how its going to work. Usually in these cases you end up evacuating a bunch of people to a large location for temporary housing, then you hope for other people to take them in while they get back on their feet. The whole virus thing ends up working against the normal human response to natural events.
Its really weird how many people survive the ’shute not opening. Not a majority or anything, but that the number is markedly greater than 0 is crazy.
I can't remember the actual stats but the odds of both chutes not working is stupidly small. Most cases of injury or death are the second chute not being pulled
Put them up in the now empty hotels?
I don’t know if Michigan has been doing that, but I know California has been having great success with getting homeless people into housing. Some hotels, claiming some empty houses.
Someone on reddit was posting how they have both evac and stay at home orders from officials
Someone on reddit was posting how they have both evac and stay at home orders from officials
Do people forget they have a second chute?
People probably panic
And yeah Doug, I said most cases, but there definitely is a surprisingly higher rate than 0 of survivals
Sometimes it's a panic/incapacitated thing, sometimes they're too low and pulling a second chute won't do anything
A friends husband died from Sky diving, the man was a dive instructor, it's assumed he blacked out during the jump.  He was still alive on the ground, they just couldn't get him to a hospital fast enough :(
```Trump Violates Federal Court Order by Blocking Parody Trump Twitter Account```
now that's a headline
A sad state of affairs
I couldn't handle the "Whataboutism" back in 2008 and 2009 when Obama was actually trying to be bipartisan and include Republicans in discussions. I have no idea how I'll ever take those arguments seriously for the next 20 years

Saw this. Georgia is a real fucked up state politically
Funnily enough, I actually like feeling super safe, which is one of the reasons I like coasters. I feel safe, but get to go really fast and accelerate real fast
Yea, she does come across as entitled, but the general argument isn't wrong
Contacts? That's what my friend does when we go on these trips
I would do a backpack or something, but then you always have to take it off before the ride and hope it's still there after. I'm still jealous of you <@UDD45P5A9> for having carrowinds as your home park... Is Fury 325 as good as everyone says it is?
What's the argument?
To me, this just sounds like complaining
I haven't been to the park since it was built, so don't know. But I've never had a disappointing ride there, so I'd say its probably as good as the rumors
But roller coasters aren't that safe...
Yeah! Haven't you ever played Roller Coaster Tycoon?
Yeah! Haven't you ever played Roller Coaster Tycoon?
I just looked it up, 14 coasters. I really have to do a road trip coaster trip sometime and hit it up
I just looked it up, 14 coasters. I really have to do a road trip coaster trip sometime and hit it up
Yeah! Haven't you ever played Roller Coaster Tycoon?
They're incredibly safe tho. People almost never die or get hurt. The park wants you to stay alive more than even you want to stay alive - think of the PR hit if a healthy person dies due to park error
I just looked it up, 14 coasters. I really have to do a road trip coaster trip sometime and hit it up
They'd lose so much money. That's why every accident is huge news - cause they rarely happen
If you're doing that, like a 5hr car ride from Charlotte is Atlanta where you have another 6 flags
That they really should be seeing one person at a time and not have people together, especially since the virus is airborne
I didn't get the impression that they'd be putting patients together
My impression was that while she is with the doctor, the hygienist will be with another patient
and like most dentists, there aren't full walls/doors into the exam rooms, just archways or openings
This seems very reasonable to me with that interpretation
Yea, I just dislike driving. But we all have to make sacrifices :grin:

It's funny - six flags New England has 12 coasters. 2.5 of which are worth going on
`Any one know the best way to test / try chairs in these times without needing to go to physical stores or paying high fees for a return (if the chair is not great)?`
wow
I had someone on the T ask me that once. 
........................
maybe you look like someone who REALLY knows his chairs
I forget the details. Maybe I had my badge visible, back when I had it on my hip. Someone on the T was talking to me and either saw I worked at Wayfair or asked me and I just told them. They specifically wanted a better way to feel a product before ordering online and I told them I had nothing to do with the store stuff. 
I wonder how much notice we'll get for Phase 1 to end and Phase 2 to start. Checking job sites daily to see when they start posting restaurant jobs and so far nothing has cropped up front of house
Keep us posted on where you're applying so we can try to influence where you work totally not in our own self-interest :hypereyes:
Eh, I'd rather bring that up when I've already got it narrowed down to where I can/have got interviews for. It's cumbersome to keep people in the loop for every application that doesn't even go anywhere.

Blossom Bar &amp; Shore Leave are my top two
but honestly, anywhere where you have the materials you need and there will be room at the bar for me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
the parent level comment was a joke
Blossom Bar I could see myself working at. Shore Leave I'll toss an application to but it would be hard to make that work
I'll also throw out Longfellow Bar

google is dodo.
I created repair for phone using an email ID. When i actually email them, the capitalization of my name goes away. So they are saying it isnt the same account
hmmmmmm
slack employee tech?
Oh damn. Is Wayfair going to send a replacement?
doing that- created a ticket actually and pinged the person assigned
nice!
Longfellow would be good. Hadn't heard of B&amp;B. Bully Boy might be too far out
check bus lines to see if they work out at all
Would you go back to Time Out if they offered?
Bully Boy would likely be a great learning experience
they have an entire shelving unit of homemade bitters that the head bartender/bar manager made
they use foam
and light wood on fire for smoked drinks
There'd be no direct lines. Would just be hell on a commute. Not knocking the quality of the program, just the quality of life hit
yeah, understood
Also depending on hours, public transport closes down
fair point
As for Daka's question, I think I legally have to go back to Time Out as part of how I was collecting unemployment if I don't line up something else before the reopen date.
Ideally I line up a job because some of these restaurants can't get their own staff back post lockdown. But I have no idea on how that is going to shake out
:hand_with_index_and_middle_fingers_crossed:
AHHHHHH i hate projects i can't run!
People are dumb and bad at leadership
yes, it doesn't help that i'm gone for 3 weeks either
Damn, how much Paternity leave do you get?
6weeks
primary gets 12 or 13 i forget
Isn't it 6 weeks standard maternity leave? or is Maternity 12?
first time I found a friendly premade in league
now in a 5-man urf group
normally people are assholes
Normal people are assholes
There is no standard in the US which is part of the problem
Lots of places are giving 3 months to mothers and 6 weeks to fathers as recruitment bonuses
I might join you tomorrow when Ash is with my parents
fair enough
That is bs
That is bs
Ya, right?
Ya, right?
It's so silly

Huh, seems extreme for a suspension to be caused by that
I already had the 3rd Witcher game, but wanted the first 2 because I don't like to jump into game series midway through (unless it doesn't matter like with Call of Duty).
$1.50 for the 1st, $3 for the second.
I think each game takes at least 50 hours...so that's like pennies per hour of gameplay
Jumping into three directly is fine. There isnt really any story continuing over from 1 and 2. 
I dunno, aren't you allowed to import the save file from 2 to 3?
You are, but it really doesn’t matter. 
I feel like it's saying that ME3 doesn't have story carry over from 1 and 2. Which it does if you played them
What I got from online is you CAN jump into 3 directly, but you lose character interactions and certain story elements don't hit the same beats because you don't have the history.
Small as that is, those things are important to me
Plus, I'd rather start with the oldest game, and be pleasantly happy with new features, fixes, enhancements, etc, then to go backwards from 3 and deciding to play 1 or 2 because I loved the lore that much
Don't play 1 tho
Don't play 1 tho
I mean, you can. But I'd pretty much describe it as unplayable
I was in the same boat as you Drew a year or 2 ago
I tried 1, but it just felt so awful to play. Ign has a great catch-up video and I didn't feel like I missed too much.
I played through 1 a long time ago. I think I started 2, but something about it, I just was never able to get past 10 minutes in. 
I played thro 2 to learn more about ciri. Turns out, she's not in it at all. It was... Okay to play. I wouldn't call it awful, but it was not great either. But unless you're pressed for time, I'd say it's worth doing it just to learn about the characters and stuff. But don't do the sidequests cause they're a huge waste of time
<@UDDE5960N> what your favorite sake?
moonstone is good quality flavored sake, pretty cheap because it's made in the US. TYKU sake is good all around. I enjoy the Tozai Plum (the others are a little hit or miss for me.)
the black and gold we've had a brenden's
demon  slayer is at the whole foods in boston, good but pricey
any special reason your asking <@UDL020K8D>?
Is she just in 1 and 3 then?
I’m probably going to order some alcohol delivery tomorrow. Figure I’m going to end up wanting a bottle, figured I’d ask for a recommendation. 
Nice, I'd good with the moonstone personally. Good quality, decent price.
:facepalm: go wi th moonstone, not good
the moonstone isn't good?
Just 3
Just 3
My fav is one I had in Japan called hakkaisan - I think it's a brand name. If you want nother opinion
The moonstone is good, I just typed good, not go in the botted message.

Alright I fixed the mistake, and even when including 2 attacks, 2 hand axes work better depending on what your strength at 2 proficiency. once you hit 3 though it only scores better at 20+acs

Tycky
Well it looks like the prometheus issue is fine. now.
Yeah Doug mentioned something about them putting in a ticket and explaining that it auto shuts off for some crazy random reason. Even when it is their fault.

Switched phone this weekend and didnt have slack on the new one- missed a lot of these messages!
welcome back chaos queen
I have no idea how/why, but my neck is quite sore
when I went to bed last night, I had to lay down flat on my back without a pillow for awhile as it was uncomfortable otherwise
there is a $200 people many people rave about. How desperate are you?
the Prime Minister is from there. It s famous for diamonds and some riots that happened a decade ago between Hindus and Muslims were lots of people died. It is famou for an anual 14 day celebration where people dance from sunset to when they want to die. They dance in circles and its called a 'Garba' and there are several events in Boston too that host this. Its famous for its 'sweets' - which are like teeny confections but VERY sweet
I mean he bought an $800 chair for his hernia...
the pillow also makes you BIYOOTYFUL
I don't think a pillow will solve this issue
Either I strained my neck, or I have a pinched nerve
but you would be byooty Brenden!
/roll 1d20
I hate lizards :disappointed:
lol
How are you doing Aysh?
It was previously established that she doesn’t like lizards, so she’s probably not been replaced by a replicant. 
how do you know it wasn't a replicant that initially established her dislike of lizards?
Ah, maybe everyone who hates lizards is a replicant. 
What's the pillow?
I'm not the biggest fan of my current one
I like the aerated foam ones
<@UDC03KCGK> where are you?
<https://www.sleepandglow.com/>
supposed to be VERY comfortable
sounds like a bunch of trash TBH
like I expect them to mention chemtrails
and anti-oxidants
yeah but 30 day return
30 day returns are a scam, too high effort
```Value for Money

The pillow will serve you for 5 years and costs only a fraction of five years' worth of creams (US$ 2500) and injections (US$ 7500)```

hehehe yeah thaats the marketing ploy but i think everyone vouches for its comfort
aso Daka- you'll stay Biyooty
I kinda agree with brenden here. All the beauty benifits that it is pushing really makes me unwilling to even give it a chance
meh- if it works it works right?
True. I can believe it is pretty comfortable.
True. I can believe it is pretty comfortable.
Home...why?
Home...why?
read the bot message above
was minorly amusing
i went out for the first time in like, 2.5 months yesterday and who do I see, but the person that quit last week because he disagreed with a PIP
wow
that’s insane
There is a God
And he endorses a troll sense of humor
clearly he's stalking you
he wants revenge for the gall you had to put him on a PIP
it's the only explanation
Got to hide yo kids, hide ya wife
ain't nobody got time fo' that
no kids no wife now i feel bad Drew :disappointed:
But now you have nothing to hide!
But now you have nothing to hide!
You can hide ash Aysh!
im being stalked, why would you risk that CJ?
So I am curious how the rest of the story went. Just an awkward pass by or did he call you out to or something?
I had a visitor this weekend who tripped and fell and passed out. 911 call resulted in fire/ paramedics and cops rusing into my apartment.
awkward pass, nothing more
wat??
ok only passed out for 30 seconds but i got scared and called 911
they called back and i told them it was a false alarm but they didnt buy it
well then
probably thought it was domestic abuse
also they are literally across the street from me
You had a visitor during a quarantine?!?!?!
you had a crazy weekend
yes so Sorry for not playing games :smile:
just wow
well after 8 people who are all emergency responders in my 300 sq ft hall, i think i can safely say my quarantining effort went kaput
to follow up with Dakota’s question, you had people over? Not trying to judge, just trying to figure out what people are doing. Sounds like its relatively safe to have small groups meet outdoors, especially if they keep some distance.
yeah, figured seeing someone once is 2 months is ok i think.
yeah, probably true. I’m finding it so hard to calibrate how much I need to do to stay safe, what are reasonable things I can still be doing
I mean, any one of those things would have been enough of an excuse as to why you weren't around.
I know a very sane smart girl who, on returning from her sisters place (sister is a physician actively treating covid patients) and immediately went to ap otluck
I am disappointed in her
I mean, those 8 emergency responders being so close I would honestly put as an encounter on the level of going to the grocery store these days.
but wouldnt they be worse since they actively go into people's houses  several times a day
potentially people calling them because they are sic
*sick
I spend every weekend at a different apartment than mine, because it's the only way I can cope with this situation.
i mean if you see people doing the same thing you are that's pretty low risk in my opinion
yeah that i made sure of
yea, your's sucks. how are you doing Victoria?
tell me more Victoria?
I'm hearing a lot of stories of medical professional or adjacent people just being complete morons about this all.
can see that :shrug:  i think theyre trained to think' no big deal, everyone's gonna get it eventually'
Well, I would believe that if it weren't for the vast majority of medical professionals talking about how that's not ok
Is this like, every weekend you stay at your boyfriend's apartment? Or there is a rotating bevy of friends or family's apartments you've been cycling through?
I don't live alone, so I can't speak toward the difficulties with that, but Sam and I have been as strict as we can with it. I go to the grocery store once a week, she's gone on some walks with a friend of hers 6 feet apart the whole time, and that's basically it.
till this weekend i hadnt done the 6 foot apart walks also
but ill probbaly fly to be with my brother soon
both him and his wife are physicians
I discovered today that rental car agencies sell used cars at significant discounts
(under market price)
think like 15% off a used car
oh yes they do!
but care condition wont be that good
like, who cares about engine oil on a rental
the rental company
I'd more say that they're driven hard and not cared well for while being driven
yes that
Boyfriend, but it's still a different dwelling, so I can understand if people judge
and typically driven more miles in a year than is desirable
but for the newer ones with lower milage, seems like a decent deal
He also can't work from home, so has been going into an office this whole time, which adds some risk, but it's one we're okay with
in the market for a car?
you can also et the cars dealerships give to customers who leave their cars for service and need a temp one
loaner
can even lease them
I'd love to have a car, but I don't think it would be financially responsible at the moment given where I live
valid
Eh, I don't know the people who would judge going to your SO's apartment. Friends it is harder to understand. I really want to go see friends and hang out with them, but recognize either I could get them sick, or they could get me or Sam sick. Your SO? Trying to keep people away from them is a bit cruel.
why do I have the feeling that pandemics will be specifically called out in terms/conditions/contracts very soon as boilerplate material
as an example, I imagine colleges accepting tuition will include clauses that don't allow for refunds in the event of a pandemic
partial refunds*
Pandemics were already part of some terms/conditions
Saw some complaints in the early days of all this. I'm guessing it will be a lot more widespread
Yeah, the not seeing friends/family has been hard. Once more things are open, maybe small groups can happen.
I think pandemics count as “acts of god”or “force majeure”, which already show up in a bunch of contracts. 
I do feel a bit selfish that I've been spending time with someone outside my dwelling, but we have been as careful as we can.
No they try to take care of them so it can be used longer. There should be a lot of good deals right now since they are claiming bankruptcy 
No they try to take care of them so it can be used longer. There should be a lot of good deals right now since they are claiming bankruptcy 
not true anymore since a lot of the rental companies are going bankrupt so they ahve to sell the cars at a discount
what did she tripped on?
foot got caught in backpack loop
all my nurses friends refuse to meet up with me
I don't see how it is selfish. Plenty of people live with their spouse or significant other. If the only thing you're doing in violating social distancing is to go live with your SO for a couple days every week, that should be kosher. 
The friends thing gets bad because then someone goes off an visits one friend "who's been careful" and then another, and another, and well gee, why didn't social distancing stop this?
I'm not posting this to throw shade on Aysh and her friend, more to emphasize the going to your boyfriend's place should be totally fine.

There are even insurance contracts specifically for these kinds of things that have been trying to get around having to payout for this. 
The insurance industry is really awful.
I think its because I am spending time with my SO, but I also have roommate's at my apartment, so theoretically, anything I do can affect them...but they're also "going out" often, so it can be a mutual selfishness
i had a visitor, could have been my mortal enemy- could have been the Devil also
could have been boyfriend, could have been girlfriend, could have been plumber
could have been stalker, could have been sleep paralysis monster
I mean, the devil would be more understandable than your mortal enemy, like the devil has been quarantined with literally the worst people, dude must need a break
yea it's worst
The way I see it is basically risk management. Like, if you are going to be seeing older relatives, or are going to be working in public with close contact with people, then how you "should" act with regards to meeting with friends/family/SO should be different than somebody who doesn't have that kind of risk of catching/spreading the virus.
Also not at all implying with :this: that I think aysh/victoria were wrong to have visitors/leave the apartment.
<@UDL020K8D> did you ever get a response, or did they just fix it with no comment?
I posted the response in the channel a while back
