Such a cute picture!!!
It is
but where did this come from?
Do you boop the snoot?
Also, <@UK7V13DS7> you never commented on my puppy pick from a few weeks ago
<@UDBGH9BMX> I don't see it hahaha
<@UDDE5960N> I saw a comment but apparently it was from like a month ago....
<@UK7V13DS7>
And probably in a different channel
flat nose?
flat earth
This is how fat I feel right now...
Do you have a baby bump? I didn't notice anything at Brenden's
you're not that fat yet, give it like another 2 months!
Yea I have a baby bump now itâ€™s been happening for a few weeks 
I feel like that turtle 
HAH
Dave called her a dog
She's a heckin good guard dog
There's no such thing as a guard puppy
my puppy is the best heckin guard dog
You SEE those hackles?
You dog is the only dog I see Hackles on this commonly
Yea, it was crazy the first time I saw it
that's a nice puppy
Tess is so skinny though
Well, she's the proper weight
Most dogs are fat
Most people in america are overweight
That is also true, though this channel is <#CDDF77EB1|puppy-pics> and not #people-pics. The latter would be a great channel though
dubious
I feel like that would devolve into a people of walmart/dollar tree real fast
Yes
I don't think anyone would want to see people-pics. It would be like a dare to see it
thats called instagram
